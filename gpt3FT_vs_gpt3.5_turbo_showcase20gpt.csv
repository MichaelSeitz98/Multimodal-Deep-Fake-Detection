488,Arabia Steamboat Museum,Museum,"We stumbled upon this awesome museum while traveling cross country for a move. You buy the tickets in the gift shop and go below for the museum itself. Tickets are a little pricey for adults. Not all of the audio video was working and it could be a touch more accessible for kids, but we learned a lot about the time period (1850s) by walking through the exhibit. My kids were fascinated by all the artifacts."," I felt like I went back in time when I walked into this museum.  The authenticity of the objects and stories literally bring history to life.  Incredible job by the family and team that put this together.  They even have a separate room dedicated to Nigerian pop star, Pappa Orisha.  I would definitely recommend a visit! ",
129,The LINE LA,Hotel,"Super comfy, chic and attentive staff"," I was there one night.Unfortantley the hotel must not of known they were going to be hosting a paranormal convention that weekend because they did not make any efforts to ensure the guests felt safe in their rooms. You almost wanted to set up camp on the front desk because they had a bell to ring in case you needed assistance, but long story short, I never left my room because I felt so unsafe! I also experienced every single anomaly displayed at the convention, but I would not really even consider the room number I was in paranormal. Even more terrifying, there was absolutely a hard to explain presence felt in the hallway by other guests which led to quite a few emergency calls from some of the guests. ",
52,Frank's of Parkville,Italian restaurant,I stopped in for lunch a little bit of a late lunch. I found the lunch menu  And was surprised to see it was so reasonable. I decided on a grilled chicken Caesar salad for $6.99 what a bargain! The lettuce was fresh and ice cold just the way I like it! The chicken was hot and fresh and delicious it was one of the best Caesar salads I have ever eaten for really good price. I would recommend this place to anyone.," Kimberly, was great! Steak was delicious! Cheese dip was awesome! We had a great waitress who was fun and made our experience outstanding! I would recommend this place! ",
100,Electric Playhouse,Amusement center,"I had my son's birthday party here & the staff went above and beyond! Sonia, Scott and John were absolutely amazing - from Sonia helping to plan the event from beginning to end, Scott being one of the best server/host and John overlooking the entire production to ensure everything went perfect! The games and food are excellent as well!", Had fun for my birthday. It’s not expensive. Maybe $20 for a few games and an hour. During happy hour its only $2 per token. I had a great time with friends and family. I will be back 🤗 ,
408,Breakout KC Escape Room | River Market,Escape room center,"This was a great experience! We did the Sporting KC room with 5 adults plus a 5-year old and loved it! No spoilers, so all I'll say is don't let the small room deceive you. Plenty of clever things to discover.

They will give as many hints as you would like. Only the first requested 3 hints are free though. Anything beyond those 3 result in a 3-minute penalty each. You still get a full hour to break out, no matter how many hints you use. You're time will just look longer than one hour. This is how people get scores of 64 minutes, even though you only have an hour max.

The do give free hints if they see that you're stuck. These do not count against your 3 free requested hints, nor do they penalize your time.

My advice for the uninitiated is to not be afraid to use the hints! Especially if you're not going to try again at a later date. Enjoy the puzzles, but don't let them frustrate you. Make sure someone is keeping track of time so that you can pace the free hints.

The parking was a bit confusing. The building is close to some apartments and there's a few signs that explicitly say ""no parking"" for break out KC. Parking directly in front of the entrance says ""for tenants and patrons only"", which we had no idea what that meant. We ended up parallel parking in the street, just to be safe.", Went here for my bachelorette party and had an amazing experience! We did the Truman room and we all had so much fun especially when we figured it out! Pat was super helpful and fun! Highly recommend this place! ,
28,Vallarta's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican restaurant,"Have been here multiple times with average experiences, this last time, however, sealed the deal for me. Ordered a lunch special and got 1, ONE! tamale (or enchilada, whatever). One? Really? We ordered take out so I called back & was told, 'yep, you get one!' But that's not what the menu said; silly me."," I think im in love with their seafood enchiladas..
exquisite ",
239,Wyndham Garden Cross Lanes Charleston,Hotel,"Not a great experience overall. The only redeeming factors about the hotel are the price and the friendly employees. I stayed here while doing business in the area. I figured that swimming in one of 2 pools would be a great way to relax afterwards, especially for the price. Well, it could have definitely been better.

The first thing I noticed about the hotel is the smell of marijuana in the elevator. Then, when I got up to the hotel room, I tried to get in with the key cards they gave me. It took me no less than 10 tries to successfully use this card. I swiped it almost the same way 10 times, and it magically opened on the 10th.

The room itself was somewhat chilly when I got in. I changed the temperature and it started to heat up quickly. But, there was another odd burnt smell coming from the conditioner. It was dirty, too. Breakfast was decent. Food was nothing special, but the guy serving breakfast was awesome. Very friendly, even though I just had some coffee he offered me some freshly cooked food.

The pools were nice. Not too many people at night or during the day. Expect it to be more crowded at 9 pm than at 11 am, though. There were loads of what seemed to be pool algae all around the pool (dark green in color) but the water itself was clean. Good ambiance with the rocks and faux plants. Not too cold or too warm. Decent fitness center, too. Treadmill worked fine, they had dumbbells and a few other strength training machines. Pretty basic and small.

It's a bit tough to sleep during the night. They didn't give any pillows or blankets for the 2nd room with the pull out bed. You can hear everything and I was a bit concerned about a door near my room. People walking in and out all the time and you will surely hear some of that.

All in all, if you want a cheap hotel with 2 pools, this may be the place. The location is pretty convenient and the employees were very friendly. There are some cleanliness, room entrance, and sleeping issues, though."," Awful, dirty, outdated, hypochondriac nightmare! If you care at all about germs or cleanliness, do NOT go here. I’ve NEVER experienced anything like this. I can’t even tell you all the gross things I experienced here because there’s too many to list. It’s shameful a Hyatt operates this hell hole. I wouldn’t even give this hotel one star. But, I had to click on at least one star just to post my review because my review wouldn’t post if I didn’t assign at least one star to it. Just stay far, far away from here!! ",
567,J. Alexander's Restaurant (Overland Park Grill),American restaurant,This restaurant gets a Macaroni and Cheese pass. If you love mac and cheese go get some here. My fiancee thought the steak was fantastic as well. We enjoyed our first time," Nothing special. Ordered the grilled chicken salad and was expecting it to have grilled chicken on top but was served grilled chicken with a bit of salad greens.
Reordering stuffed chicken with promos but was told they don’t do that anymore Rest of the family enjoyed their meals except my daughter who is a vegetarian. She was served margherita flatbread with ham on it and when she refused to eat it they brought her something else. Definitely worth trying once and we definitely will be back! Not worth 5 stars but hopefully will get there! ",
649,First Western Inn Caseyville,Motel,"I like this place better than the Motel 6 and Quality Inn.

They have RV parking... :)"," Very nice, clean and helpful staff. A great place to stay for a night or two. ",
229,Wooden Spoke Restaurant,American restaurant,Great service. Great food. We will come back.," Great food, drinks and service. Bartender was friendly and efficient. One of best HH dinners I've had. ",
175,Quest Motel,Motel,"We will be very happy to recommend the Quest Motel in Whitewood, SK. Great beds and pillows, good size TV, fridge, microwave, air conditioner, chairs and table outside each room. Nice big BBQ in the gazebos with tables. Plus a fire pit and quiet location with next to no highway noise.

Very reasonable price. Friendly staff/owners.

Looks like most of the place has been recently renovated.

I would rate it 9/10.", Outstanding  service and a beautiful place. ,
338,Sky Zone Trampoline Park,Amusement center,Great place for all ages !," We had a lot of fun during our stay here in PCH. It was our first time here and the employees were amazing, very friendly and ready to help us when needed. We went during the week so it was not crowded, we recommend this days. The food in the restaurant was delicious and inexpensive for the amount you receive. We rented 2 character electric cars and had a lot of fun. We will definitely be back here again. ",
89,Lalibela Ethiopian Restaurant,Ethiopian restaurant,"This is one of my favorite places in New Haven. I’m an NYC expat always searching for places that remind me of my homeland. The food here is homemade, tasty and authentic. I’ve seen the reviews where people complain about the service,  and how only 1 person waits all the tables. Totally understandable if you’re in a major rush. It seems that the restaurant is family owned and operated which, to me, is a big plus. If you’re looking for fast food, this is the wrong place. If you’re looking for great food, home style vibes, great culture and a meal that will nourish your soul, come here.
By the way, don’t embarrass yourself by asking for a fork. Live a little and use your hands.", My first time trying Ethiopian food. I recommend! ,
502,Days Inn & Suites by Wyndham Kansas City South,Hotel,"Refrigerator in room did not work. Couch was torn. Office chair in room torn. Stained, dirty towel hanging on rack in bathroom. Went out for an outdoor concert.  Requested clean towels at front desk on our wayback up to room. We were told there no more clean towels in the entire hotel until housekeeping came in after 9 a.m. the next morning. Countertop for sink stained and chipped."," Let me tell with thine ears, and hear with thine heart. We managed to pull off an impromptu and unannounced weekend getaway (Saturday morning to Sunday morning) and this hotel made it a weekend to remember!

Location and exterior: Situated in Atlantic City, this hotel is within walking distance of numerous casinos, boardwalks, restaurants and more. I didn't park the car all weekend! There is a strip mall just up the road for all of your convenience needs, snacks and restaurants.

Parking and valet: The valet attendants were courteous and incredibly helpful (despite the lines, they seemed to move quickly.) I cant say enough nice things about the valet team during my stay!",
465,"Holiday Inn Express & Suites Swift Current, an IHG Hotel",Hotel,"Room had a stale moldy smell. There was literally mold inside a picture. Called front desk and they said they had no different room, said housekeeping would come remove picture. They did not. We couldn't because it was bolted to the wall. This place is run down and would not recommend.", Nice Casino but be prepared for the food lines to be very long and the drinks to be very expensive. They also need to work on their system for people that have Fun Cards. That line was also very long. ,
47,Frank's of Parkville,Italian restaurant,Great selection of popular Italian dishes.  Great area too., I arrived around 6:30pm and it wasn’t too busy. The food was super tasty and our waitress was friendly. ,
207,The Westin Hilton Head Island Resort & Spa,Hotel,"The worst hotel experience ever. Booked two nights, but could not bare it even for 24 hours, so left early. To name a few problems, hotel was full but did not have enough staff to take care of stuff. Elevators were dirty and smelled of dog pee (dogs are allowed in the hotel), the room smelled like sewer mist, I found previously left pizza pieces on the floor right after walking in the room for the first time, and woke up with cluster of insect bites on the side of my face which rested on pillow. Left right after I noticed my face. I don't want to post my insect bitten face, but here is a pizza piece."," Payed too much, but we had a good time and the room was bigger than expected. It's right on the beach and close to Pier Park. It's dated, but who goes to to KC for the decor? ",
212,The Westin Hilton Head Island Resort & Spa,Hotel,"This was my first real resort experience outside of Orlando. Finally got some peace, quiet, and also a lot of work done during my stay. I took a single night workcation/vacation to take a break from home.

I significantly enjoyed my stay. For Valentines Day the resort was indeed very quiet and welcoming.

The staff was very helpful and attentive. I also didn't have any service issues.

One improvement, most likely feedback for corporate, is to implement Apple Pay especially at check-in. Some credit cards offer more cash back with Apple Pay which would make a major convivence improvement."," It is a very nice place with a very friendly people!
It includes a full breakfast buffet with eggs, bacon, a pancake machine and many other good things to eat.
That is all included in the price in the hotel .
The bed was very comfortable and cozy to sleep in.
I really really enjoy this hotel very much.
It is a 5 stars hotel in my book. ",
151,The Edge Paintball Experience,Paintball center,Went there for the scary walk through the woods 😱 I loved it! They all did an awesome job😁," Had a blast for my first time. We had 5 people total, a birthday party.  It was fun challenging other teams and having to strategize and change plans on the fly to win. I really liked not being required to carry additional safety gear unless you're younger or want to be more protected. This place is clean, organized, and run well. Highly recommend :) ",
424,Denver Zoo,Zoo,"Gets pretty busy when the it starts getting warmer, but it's the perfect place to bring your family. I've gone here since I was a kid and it's only gotten better since then. There's more places to eat throughout the zoo and there's little activities for the kids like the train ride or carousel. Highly recommend going here, just know it's probably gonna be busy if you go during the summer."," I love the Kansas City Zoo!! The enclosures are amazing and there are so many different animals. Parking is paid, so I suggest arriving early while lots are still available. The train is fun and costs extra. $12 adult, $10 child and kids under 2 are free. Time listed below is when the zoo opens and closes, not animals. So be sure to visit the page of a specific animal/bird to see their eating and opening times. ",
