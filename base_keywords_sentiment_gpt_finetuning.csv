Our waiter was super nice, super friendly, and was efficient. My husband and I ordered drinks and appetizers. Then we ordered our food, and everything was delicious and yummy. It was a really great romantic experience. The only thing that could’ve been better was their dessert menu. Also, I was confused about the parking situation. We didn’t see a valet or a parking lot.

I’ve only been here once and sat at the bar, so I cannot speak to the full dining experience, but the bar was very mediocre, they have the look but not the talent which made it disappear (or maybe just not the resources to make good drinks).

Fish and Chips: for the win! Fish was lightly seasoned, cooked to perfection, and the fries were goody good good. Appreciate and liked the tarter sauce and malt!

I was really surprised about the quality of the foods. I thought it might be mediocre because they probably don't have to worry about getting guests because of the TV show. The food was outstanding and I'm super high maintenance about quality! We came for the happy hour and got 4 different appetizers. Best fries I have ever had with a great dip. The wontons had quite a bit raw tuna and they were also paying attention to the presentation. The taste was really divine and rounded with balsamic reduction, pomegranate and avocado. The shrimp was garnished with mango. They had quite a few people who were serving so you didn't have to wait and they were super friendly,   and everyone was quite attractive.

The only 2 things that could be improved are: 1. They only serve happy hour items in the garden, on 2 tables and then those tables didn't have a server (but one guy was willing to serve us). 2. It was my birthday and when I got the reservation it asked for occasion and I wrote birthday and I kinda thought someone would at least say ""Happy Birthday"" to me.

"Write a 2.0 stars Google Maps review about a Mexican restaurant, with the following keywords: waitstaff, taco, tasted.","The waitstaff is amazing!! Angela is fantastic! And I'll admit the hand pinched taco was tasty! (Beef with parm)  The house frozen margarita was incredibly sweet. Which I like, but the alcohol is very light. And from here on out, just NO.

The waitstaff and busser is the only reason they got 2 stars!

Do not walk, run!  The salsa was interesting. It was okay and had carrot bits in it. Odd, but I like to try new things. I got the spinach dip. The large. The most disgusting dip I've ever had. It tastes like the cheese was the cheapest they could find and I couldn't tell if the spinach was from a can or a cheap frozen brick. Other than that it was beyond bland. There was an odd taste I've had before but I couldn't even eat 1/8 without the margarita. (And sadly I will gorge on cheese dip.) So, no to the salsa, no to the spinach cheese dip, and the chips are eh. The frozen margarita, was really weak, definitely not worth $6, but sweet if that's how you like it. I do. 😊 The pinched taco... okay, I really enjoyed that! The waitstaff - someone needs to poach them!!! This place doesn't deserve them.

Edit:
The frozen margarita,  I still stand by that it is sweet, but I have more of a buzz than I realized. So the alcohol's just kind of hidden.  I will say I would indulge in another frozen Margarita here.

The ""busser"" I referred to, come to find out, is the manager. Not expected, but he was a hard worker, great personality, friendly, and very welcoming.

I will admit, he said several people commented on the dip saying it tasted weird and took it off no issues or real questions.

I personally don't plan on coming back. But if they were slow and I was bored and wanted to chat with the staff, I would eat a taco and have a margarita. If you live close by, and love to support Mom and Pop places as I do, I say give it a try and leave your experience on here. Maybe I just caught them on a really off day.

The baked potato was delicious and very flavorful, but the strip steak with blue cheese crust was all panko breadcrumbs and very little blue cheese. The steak was also a bit tough for the $39 price tab.

Service was also very slow. 40 minute wait for a table that never came so I sat at the bar instead and then waited another 10 minutes to have my drink request taken.

The glass of red wine I chose was out of stock, so I had to choose something different and waited another 10 minutes for someone to ask if I wanted a drink.

"Write a 3.0 stars Google Maps review about a Conveyor belt sushi restaurant, with the following keywords: restaurant, sushi, inari.","Really love the concept! Some of the dishes were tasty while others were okay nothing too fancy,
If you are super hungry this type of style restaurant would be best bet as when you get seated you can start eating your food if you see anything you like on the conveyor belt.

We had appetizers and some decent sushi.
Some of the faves were:
Golden Sushi Roll
Tiger Roll
Texan Roll
Spicy Popcorn Roll
Shrimp Avocado Roll
CHEESECAKE

Inari was a little different but not too bold or sweet (neutral)
I gave it 3 stars because:
Cleanliness of the restaurant, it was a little smelly (outside of the raw food), even outside the restaurant.
We weren’t treated as a new customer, we were so lost until we had to flag down a waiter to help us understand and even then, we had to read over the instructions which are on the belt of how to order and how to take off plates on conveyor belt. We did eventually figure it out.
Lastly, their drinks options are very limited-  their tea (green) was not your typical tea it was not great - so we stuck with water.

"Write a 5.0 stars Google Maps review about a Mediterranean restaurant, with the following keywords: marhaba, buffet, samosa.","Exceptional. We started out for Glam Doll Donuts, saw a Mexican bakery (Marissa's) down the street and got distracted. By the time we bought our Mexican pastries, it was lunchtime and Marhaba was across the intersection.

Understand one thing about Marhaba and you will fare much better there: don't expect much from their ""American"" food (looking at you, fried chicken wings). Everything else is very, very good. They do a Mediterranean buffet better than The Marina a few miles north. I didn't think that was possible and here I sit full an so very much corrected.

Things I needed seconds of (some of which I had, some of which I was too full to do again): baklava, catfish, lamb Kafka, tabouleh, gyro meat, meat samosa.

$42 for 2 adults and 2 preschoolers on some mysterious pay per year of the child's age system. So probably somewhere around $15/person with a soda. If the quality of the Mediterranean food wasn't so high, I would have dropped a star for the price. In this case , however, I have nothing to complain about: I feel I received an excellent value food:cost.

"Write a 5.0 stars Google Maps review about a Zoo, with the following keywords: zoos, zoo, recommend.","Really enjoyed this zoo. It was compact, walkable and had a wide range of species. Staff was friendly, ticket rates were reasonable ($15 for adults).

Located near Denver city park, it’s a short 5 min walk from the interesting musuem of science and nature which is yet another worthwhile attraction in this area. There’s ample parking here if you are renting a car, otherwise it’s pretty accessible via ride-based apps as well.

They have a number of lions and penguins greeting you as you enter and then a plenitude of primates likes orangutans, chimpanzees and gorillas waving at you from their large enclosures. Animals are well looked after here like in other zoos in LA, Oakland and San Diego and have a good amount of space to wander about so let your conscience not bother you for indulging at their price.

"Write a 5.0 stars Google Maps review about a Zoo, with the following keywords: zoo, exhibits, denver.","We haven't been here in about a year and so much has changed! It was a great zoo before, but even better now. Plan to spend quite some time there. My daughter and I were just there for two hours and didn't get to see everything! It got too close to closing time lol. Will go earlier next time (went at 230 on a Saturday). The exhibits the animals are staying in are amazing. I was especially impressed with the elephant and giraffe houses. The way the place is set up and designed is awesome. And you can tell the care takers are really great and take loving care of their animals.

Random tips: We took our own water bottles. There are water bottle filling stations throughout the zoo so you don't have to purchase drinks if you don't want to. There is a water spray station for the kiddos if they get too hot. Some of the indoors exhibits are also air conditioned. Lots of places to rest or just observe the animals. I will say parking is tight when it's busy, so if you make a reservation, give yourself plenty of time to find parking. The garage is free and has four levels, elevators take a minute, walk the stairs if you're trying to get to the entrance for a reservation. City Park is also right next to the zoo and has an awesome play ground and places to picnic. Masks are not required, but some guests do wear them. I wore one because I'm high risk and was fine. Can't wait to go back! Hope the avian bird flu passes soon so the birds can come out, but gotta keep all the animals safe ❤️.

*Our passes were free through Denver Public Library. You have to make the reservations ahead of time online. I believe the prices are $20 for adults and $15 for kids 3 - 11, otherwise.

"Write a 3.0 stars Google Maps review about a Tourist attraction, with the following keywords: legoland, aquarium, zoo.","I went with family - we brought children ages 5, 6, 7 & 10. The kids all enjoyed the experience.

Information: Park in the Crown Plaza and have your parking validated. Plan to spend 1-1.5 hours there. We were there just over an hour and saw everything. We purchased combo Legoland/Sea Life tickets.

Pros: They have a handout for the kids and “punch stations” throughout that encourage kids to read and learn about the animals and exhibits. There is a variety of sea life to look at, some very beautiful exhibits and the information is easy to read and understand - very age appropriate. There is a “touch” station and the kids enjoyed seeing what different creatures felt like.

Cons: I expected to need to spend more time here, it was actually quite small. One of the punch stations for the kids’ activity was out of order. The entire sea turtle display was closed. The final station had iPads available and about 5/15 of the iPads were on and working.

Final Thoughts: This was a neat experience, but once was enough. If you’re looking for an amazing aquarium and zoo experience, consider checking out the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Nebraska.

I love claw machines(the more challenging the better), and this place has TONS of them.

I purchased a $40 card and after a few arcade tries I went to try a claw.

After about 10 tries my card ran out of money, and I went to go re-load it. While I was gone, the progress that I had made on the item in the machine was re-set by a worker, which led me to a mini-freakout.

Luckily, he saw me and apologized, opened the machine and placed the item back where it was and let me continue. After about six more tries, I won! The key with the Japanese claw machines is PATIENCE.

The male employee ails started, he'd had a few customers the day before who wanted the discount as well, and he had to figure out how to get to the page that states it's online only! Having a large family, attending these establishments is difficult, not affordable, and discouraging when these discounts are misrepresenting the company without clicking farther into the website. Purchased the packs this time, but will not be doing this again in the future!

"Write a 5.0 stars Google Maps review about a Video arcade, with the following keywords: arcades, arcade, barcade.","My work involves a lot of travel and I’ve been fortunate to visit multiple arcades around the world, including Japan. I’d easily rank the four Free Play locations in the DFW metro area collectively as the best arcades I’ve visited in the United States. In fact, I think the fact they routinely acquire new games and swap out machines on the floor gives them an advantage over the few remaining retro Japanese arcades.

In short, THIS is how you do an arcade right. I hate the term “barcade” but I suppose this is one in the sense they have an impressive bar and kitchen on site. That said, unlike almost every other self-styled barcade I’ve visited, the drinks and food complement the games rather than serve as the primary attraction.

What sets Free Play apart is the diversity and rarity of its games. These feature some true gems on original hardware that go well beyond the dime-a-dozen Pac-Man and Centipede cabs found elsewhere. For example, the Richardson location (at the time of this writing) has an ultra-rare Planet Harriers, an Atomiswave running Dolphin Blue, the first Beast Busters, Do Don Pachi, Power Stone 2, and the original Marvel Vs. Capcom…to name just a few. I’m not really into pinball but there are quite a few of those machines on the floor too.

Once you get in line no one let you know that you can pay for a VIP pass and skip the line for $20. Unless you asked about it you want no. We heard another lady asked about it and she was told that she could go to the front of the line for an additional $20 on top of the $20 he already paid.

It was so hot outside we paid the money. It is rather small, which definitely resemble the trap house, but it has great content and material inside. I thoroughly enjoyed our experience there.

My honest opinion: I have an appreciation for all music. Crunk/trap is definitely one that has created the current culture of Atlanta. I also appreciate people who come from these communities have some level of representation. The reasons why I give this a 3 stars is because of the lack of education the museum provided and the overhype. If they provided visitors (who haven’t experienced this lifestyle) insight/depth knowledge it would have been a much better experience. DEFINITELY NOT KID FRIENDLY! I was surprised at people bringing their young children to this 🙄. Should be an age limit.
To me, it was just a display of a “trap house” that you can see for free in these same communities lol.

"Write a 2.0 stars Google Maps review about a Hotel, with the following keywords: hotel, wilshire, rooms.","This hotel is all hype and no substance. If you like ridiculously tiny overpriced rooms with concrete walls then this place is for you. We walked into an 80 degree room because their AC was on the fritz. Didn’t cool down till late at night. One entire wall is a floor to ceiling window so by noon you have to use the blackout shade to keep the room cool. So then it feels like you’re in a prison cell.
Location is great but otherwise too many cons:
- mandatory valet parking at $46/night.
- weak AC and water pressure
- room is so tiny with barely a closet and no dressers so you have no place to put your things. Barely have a place to walk.
- the blackout curtains don’t work properly and suddenly go up and down on their own.
- hotel is on Wilshire so tons of street noise (windows are not sound proofed)
- construction going on next door
- plumbing is terrible
- gym is tiny in relation to the size of this hotel (as well as their pool).

"Write a 4.0 stars Google Maps review about a Hotel, with the following keywords: hotel, restaurant, room.","I stayed one night at The LINE Hotel on Wilshire to attend the Blackpink concert at Banc of California stadium on Nov. 20. It was a short visit as I flew in from Honolulu on the 20th and arrived at the hotel around 4:30pm. Whoa, a pretty eclectic place ... very industrial, loft-ish style with bare concrete walls and austere furnishings. My room was on the smallish size with a small, but perfectly adequate bathroom, a very small closet and just enough seating for two. The bed faced the floor-to-ceiling wall of glass overlooking Wilshire Boulevard. There is a wall-mounted TV and power shades for privacy.

The concert was at 8pm and I arranged a ride at 5:30pm so I went to the bar for a drink. It's a nice space but there was a limited selection of gins so I ordered a Hendricks gin and tonic. A perfectly fine drink, albeit at a price. As this is a review of the hotel, I'll omit anything related to the concert.

I returned at midnight and wanted to find a place to have some drinks and dinner but it was too late. So, I had to make do with whatever I had in my duffle bag (cookies) and retired for the night. The bed is comfortable though the noise from the street was somewhat intrusive.

The next morning I went down to the 2nd floor where the Openaire Restaurant is located. It's a bright, airy space with a large bar on one side. I had the LINE breakfast: two eggs, pancakes, chicken sausage and cottage potatoes. The eggs were somewhat underdone but the breakfast was fine; at least for an hour. I spent the remainder of my stay in the bathroom in my room ... something in the breakfast didn't agree with me.

I would like to show some  pictures before really describing about the service because this is what a “4-star” hotel in  Los Angeles ,USA  can offer.
Are they mocking on themselves or us?
Because I haven’t  had such a terrible service in my lifetime !!!!!
1)We find this 4-star hotel and see that we need to pay for parking when their website actually shows free parking under amenities.
2)We had a long 9hrs journey and we were relocating so we had lot of stuff as luggage and happen to check in by 10.30pm.We told the front desk that we are really tired and what they offered was a trolley and we had to carry entire luggage ourselves, explanation was “we don’t have anybody” when they are supposed to have somebody for customers “all the time”.RIDICULOUS!!!!Clearly shows LACK OF EMPATHY.
Well we carried our own luggage since we were super tired to find another hotel.
3)We got into room and we see our bath shower is worn off and broken.
4)No kettle which is like a very basic thing to make coffee in morning, we asked and receptionist could tell us there is a cafe which will be opened by 6.30am.Clearly shows RUNNING FROM RESPONSIBILITY
5)Now I didn’t know 4 star hotels started keeping open plastic bucket as waste bins in bathrooms.SERIOUSLY!!!!!
6)And the funniest out of all is they have kept a big basket with snacks chocolates, nuts, water and I was skeptical about it and I just called up to know if they come as complementary. Well it seems it is kept to tempt the people to use it and they will charge for every single thing during checkout .
7)Even 2-star hotels actually have hair dryers, kettle and covered waste bins in bathroom.

I don’t even know what to say .Can’t believe I’m given such a terrible service in a developed country like USA.

The manager ghosted me after me emailing him about how cold I was overnight and could not sleep.

"Write a 5.0 stars Google Maps review about a Hostel, with the following keywords: hostels, hostel, motel.","It was my first time staying at a hostel and I'm glad it was at this location, close to the lake in a nice area. Compared to many a 1-star motel or hotel, it's bare bones in room amenities, but the sense of community and the savings are good reasons to consider staying in one. What comes to mind is a boarding house, which I suppose hostels are akin to, but the staff at this place are helpful and responsive to guest needs and concerns. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and the nice patio area. Our fellow guests were from various places and the ones we met were friendly.

Nearby are many nice restaurants, cafes, businesses, conveniences, and bars. To the east is the North Pond, and further the lake shore. You can walk, run, or bike to your heart's content (convenient for pet owners too as it's very pet friendly in the area). It's less than 15 minutes away from the conservatory and the zoo (both free). There are are wonderful museums both in the area and a little further away (but in stone's throw).

Tips: 1) bring your own food to store in the plentiful refrigerated cases (they provide bins and labels) to save on dining expenses or if you have specific dietary requirements. 2) Their parking spaces are limited so arrive within 5 minutes of check-in. It's $28 a night to park there. 3) Alternatively, use an app like SpotHero to book affordable longer term spaces in the area (12 hours to a several days). 4) the kitchen is huge and well maintained, but do your part to help keep it that way (same goes for the bathrooms). 5) if you're looking for fun things to do, check out the activities chalkboard in the lobby. 6) Be respectful, kind, and friendly to everyone there.

First time staying at a hostel and I was a bit disappointed. The room was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, it was for three people and it got a bit cramped. It was the private one and almost costed $400.

The parking was a big issue for us since we didn’t get a chance to pay for the parking at the hostel. Eventually we found a lot to park in a few minutes away.

The bathrooms were okay, they were clean which was nice.

My sister got the breakfast and did not enjoy it.

The person at the front counter was nice.

"Write a 4.0 stars Google Maps review about a Resort hotel, with the following keywords: resort, pool, swimmers.","Family of 4 ~ kids age 7 and 3.
Stayed 3 nights over the Fourth of July 2022.
Rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly and laidback.
We spent most of the time at the outdoor pool/water park. I was able to keep an eye on my 7 year old as he went down the huge slides and played water basketball. He was able to play freely and had a great time. Kids under 48 inches are not allowed on the big slides. There is an area that has a smaller slide that kids of all ages can use and it was a big hit.
We didn’t explore the indoor water park much because the weather was so nice. However periodically there would be a 30 min break for the lifeguards and the swimmers outside. By the last day we learned the breaks were not at the same time.
Also,  adult beverages were available and prices were reasonable.  Despite a bar on site it was still family friendly.
The rule of No outside food or drinks was not enforced. Lots of families brought their own snacks and drinks down to the pool. Which I think worked out because the food concessions was overwhelmed and understaffed. The resort appeared to be understaffed in general - likely true for many places in the area right now. But like I said everyone was friendly, and pretty chill.
Lifeguards did not enforce much either and at times arguably may have been a sleep. Life jackets are allowed, and I would highly encourage them for kids who cannot swim well.

TECH TIPS FOR ENTERTAINERS... Make sure you leave extra time for a load in... There is some distance from the front door to the ballroom.  Also bring extension cords in case you need to split your power requirements between two breakers.  There is only one main outlet behind the staging area.  I ran the other cord outside to the outlet where I set up to do the ceremony.  You're going to need a 100-footer to get you back to the main setup inside.

"Write a 4.0 stars Google Maps review about a Hotel, with the following keywords: hotel, spa, beach.","We were able to book this fun hotel during an “off week”. We spent 2/5 days without leaving. They truly offer everything.

Not long after we checked in, they sent us 2 free app coupons & a bottle of champagne with a thoughtful note for our anniversary.

Our king room was clean & spacious. The bed was SO fluffy, which I loved. We had a partial ocean view which was nice bc that wasn’t what I booked. Most reviews say rooms are outdated, I guess they kind of are but it’s not terrible. Every day we walked past rooms being cleaned, like furniture flipped over & scrubbing. (I’m sure it’s easier for them to do in down time.) I was seriously impressed. The room had complementary water & coffee, a fridge, iron, hair dryer..etc Our only inconvenience was no microwave for leftovers.

All of the staff was so welcoming and kind! Someone said they were short handed, like everywhere, but we didn’t really notice until our last day when a lot more people started coming in. Even then, it wasn’t a problem for us.

The Spa! I wish we would’ve thought to book services sooner. It’s pricey but worth it!

The pools are nice & grounds well manicured. Pools close at 9 which was disappointing. We wanted to use the hot tub at night but couldn’t seem to get there before then.

The walk to the beach is easy with a nice path. We took advantage of the lifeguards umbrella & chair rentals. I believe it was $40 a day. The beach was a little crowded the 2 days we were able to go. I just thought, I couldn’t imagine how busy it would be in the summer.

Last, find the breakfast buffet! They have everything. It was wild. Lol

Overall, we would stay here again if it was in our budget & low crowds. This place is expensive along with every extra thing to go with it. It was our anniversary so we splurged.

"Write a 4.0 stars Google Maps review about a Hotel, with the following keywords: hotel, rooms, reviews.","This is our first time staying at this location. I hope to give some thorough information as I read many mixed reviews before staying here ....
The hotel itself is slightly outdated. This can be seen on many reviews. Now, even though it is outdated, it is still VERY well kept overall. The rooms were very clean, the food areas were great and the common areas inside the hotel were beautiful. The pool areas did need attention. There were frequently plastic cups floating in one of the pools. A waterfall feature of the pool was not in use anymore and instead had many trash pieces and was starting to grow fungus looking things.
The restaurants were very yummy and service there was great. Drinks were tasty and priced well.
The biggest frustration of the hotel was the communication and activity calendar. They hand you an activity calendar and I spent much time preparing my kids for the great activities. However, most workers didn't know what was going on, some events didn't even occur. Kids crafts were free one day and then the next they were $17 to paint a canvas and make a pinwheel. The movie stated on the calendar was not the movie playing one night. It was just sad to see so many great events planned but yet, no communication and no great follow through.
Overall, I would definitely stay at this hotel many times again. I do hope that somehow they can get better communication between the workers and the events calendar.

The rooms were a little humid even with the air conditioning at 65 which made for some sticky night sleeps but still very cold for the hot weather we experienced.

The food at View 32 was excellent. We highly recommend the Grilled Cheese BLT Panini! I wish they still had the lobster roll from a few years ago when we visited but I was able to find that at a nearby local restaurant. The servers we had were also amazing!

I also had delightful experiences with Clive from the Front Desk and Madison from Guest Services. They had exceptional customer service skills which is the reason I choose Marriott!

"Write a 4.0 stars Google Maps review about a Hotel, with the following keywords: westin, marriott, hotel.","You pick the Westin for location location location. They are right on the beach and many of their rooms face the ocean with small porches. Some (like ours) are on the ocean, which was a great choice.

Beach access is really convenient. So convenient in fact we didn't use the pool once. The beach might be one of the best I've seen, easily beating Maui, HI. Make sure to take advantage of the chair / umbrella rental service with beach patrol. They don't ask for tips or have a tip jar, but I encourage you to tip generously. They are fantastic and work extremely hard.

The service at the hotel was extremely responsive and friendly, although the front desk was often overwhelmed with lack of concierge support, so I'd STRONGLY encourage you to submit any service requests through the Bonvoy (Marriott loyalty) app. They even found an item I left in the room last checkout, and held it for me. That rarely happens and is a sign of great training.

We used the on-property restaurant for apps and drinks, but it wasn't our thing. If you're a Applebee's or Chili's fan you will probably enjoy it, albeit they do charge resort prices. If you're a fan of Chefs that use seasonal ingredients, win notable awards, and obsess about details, you may not enjoy it.

The property was very clean, the service was extremely friendly, but the rooms themselves are really showing their age as are the furnishings. Worn furniture with slight staining and spotting is expected when staying here. To be clear, we did our best not to track sand in our room, but when we did, it would magically disappear when housekeeping tidying up the room. They were very thorough, even cleaning our windows when they got too much ocean salt on them. Well done!

The pool was always chaotic and guests reserve chairs early in the morning and don't come back until much later. There supposedly is a rule that doesn't allow this but it wasn't enforced. First come first serve.

The beds were so worn couldn’t hardly stay in bed they were broken down at the edges. Sink didn’t drain, drawers were broken, shower handle wouldn’t stay in place for the temperature control. Changed to another room.  The toilet tank has a large crack. Air conditioner leaked so bad we laid towels down to soak up the water and it was so bad the towels could be wrung out.  Very moldy.  Found a dead cockroach the 3 night.  The morning we checked out a 4 inch cockroach came out from under the sofa. The floor was saturated for about 8 feet.  3 of us have acute sinus infections and sore throats from living in this roach and mold infested room.  The problem is they don’t have other rooms to move you to because of being fully booked. They say they will send maintenance to check the problem but they don’t show up. The place needs a major remodel. The breakfast was meh. They had a hard time keeping up with filling the empty items and rarely wiped off the tables.  I have been a Hilton Honors member for many years and have stayed many times in the Hilton family hotels. This was the worse hotel I have ever stayed in.

We paid for an oceanfront view, and the view was gorgeous. Breakfast was also great. Most of the staff we interacted with were lovely.

I don’t usually nitpick, but I was paying $400 a night and find some things just not excusable at that price.
They don’t have daily maid service, and you have to go down to get towels/toilet paper and take out your own trash. Again, for the price I was paying, I think daily service would be expected. You can only get a full service every 5 days.
They are dog friendly, which is amazing…but there was no place to take them to the bathroom. The abandoned lot next door was what we opted for, but it was filled with thorny and burred plants. They are not allowed on the beach (city law) so there are really no options.

"Write a 2.0 stars Google Maps review about a Hotel, with the following keywords: hotel, lounge, room.","For nearly $500/night, I was expecting more than the standard hotel however, it was nothing more than average.  The front desk was nice but I had to walk by an overly full garbage can when walking in, so that set the tone. I wouldn’t mind really, but it was that way every day that I was there. The can in the pool area was also overflowing by lunch and never changed until the end of the day.
This place has a smaller than average pool with very little seating. Approx 20 lounge chairs and there was room for many more. There were no umbrellas or tables In the pool area and very little shade.  There is a small bar outside that had some shaded seating. Prices for cocktails was $12+ .  Bring your ant spray, as there was an abundance of ants around the pool.  The breakfast seating area is a decent size but it doesn’t accommodate the amount of people that can stay at that hotel. I know it’s not reasonable to plan for every patron to eat breakfast at the same time however, when it’s 15-20 min wait to make a waffle or wait on some other item to come out so you can have something before they close the doors on you, then it’s a problem.
Our room had a rusted, I mean RUSTED, like throw it away it’s so rusty, lamp.

Room was very clean, gulf view, great AC, and it was quiet. Across the street are a few restaurants, walking distance to Starbucks. Publix and Walmart very close by.

The room seemed clean but there were small things like the old coffee pods were left in the pots from the former visitors and one bedspread had a nasty looking stain. I took the spread down and asked for a replacement but they did not have any.

On the positive side, the breakfasts were very plentiful and tasty.  We would have liked it if the hotel had kept the coffee available all day like other Hampton Inns do but they did give us coffee packets so we could make it in our room.

We stayed in one of the suites and it was a nice room.  It's getting a little dated but not too bad.   The view from the 9th floor was wonderful.

The breakfast was always served hot and there was always plenty even though we often ate towards the end of the meal time. They serve you instead of you picking what you want - Covid19 restrictions.

Since they are not cleaning the rooms and restocking supplies and clean towels each day, we were left to ask for toilet paper, new paper cups, coffee, etc. Several times it seemed as though they didn't want to get anything for us and that we were imposing on them to ask for a trash bags or whatever. I would suggest having a time frame each morning that the guests could get what they need without ""disturbing"" the front desk staff. Other than that the staff was pleasant.
One of the elevators was out of service the entire time we were there. Apparently it has been out for several weeks.. while most of time it wasn't too long of a wait, during the weekends it got a little crazy.

"Write a 3.0 stars Google Maps review about a Resort hotel, with the following keywords: resort, hilton, beachview.","I loved this resort up until today. I have visited several times since last year, and have never had 1 problem. My previous visits, the rooms were dated, with a musty, moldy odor. We were on the 7th floor where the toilets were way too small.  They were very low to the floor. But, Crystal Haire, the AWESOME Front Office Supervisor, was very nice and professional. She upgraded both my rooms to the newly renovated rooms, with a perfect beachview! Both my rooms are junior deluxe suits, with two queen beds with pull out lamps on both sides of the bed, one sofa bed, and two junior beds. Each junior bed has their very own tv. The bathroom has the barnyard sliding door, and the rooms are cooling much better than before, as the vent was in the corner, blocked by the curtain, and in an area where is was impossible to cool the room properly. Now there are 2 vents located in a proper area to cool the room properly. Estelle is also very nice, friendly, and personable. She works the food and beverage area. She has a great personality. It goes a long way with me. This is a great resort, in a very nice location. I have 6 of my family members here for the very 1st time. They wanted to the beautiful water. The tides were up, so We couldn't get into the water. The water was barely touching our feet, as so many others. Hilton's beach police/security drove up to us us specifically, and told us that we couldn't allow the water to touch our feet. We were all stunned, because there were so many others doing the exact same thing. Even further into the water. He drove off, and some non-blacks asked what did he say to us, and we told her. This one in particular was saddened! She said look at all these other doing the same, and some are practically swimming, and nothing has been said to them. I actually wanted to leave, and go home. We hadn't been there for 5 minutes when he came up to us. This occurred around 10 a.m., so you'll know who was on duty.  But, I'm yet here with my family. Please see pictures of others walking through the water. Prejudice is very much alive. Other than this, you all would get 5 plus stars.

"Write a 1.0 stars Google Maps review about a Hotel, with the following keywords: hotels, hotel, guests.","This place was way below our expectations we decided to spend a little more and stay at a known hotel line rather than risking it with an unknown place just to enjoy our weekend away. And we were WRONG, the picture attached of the rusted bathroom equipment was just 1 of many unacceptable issues.

Service: the worse, upon arrival they were very flat not very welcoming this place is huge with different things going on and no one even told me anything I had to figure out where and what everything was. But that’s not even the issue. House keeping is almost impossible to get I’ve never been to a hotel where you have to call a specific number to request it within a restricted time frame. Zero small bathroom/shower supplies. We were charged 40 dollars a night for valet parking and no one even answered the phone when we had a dinner date to get our car so we had to walk to the actual place then wait for the car.

The restaurants and bars mind you that are already over priced have awful service because they are SOOOO understaffed this one poor man was literally running the entire Resturant and bar while getting yelled at. The one pool bar they had, there were like 10-12 people wrapped around in a line just to get one drink by the pool in the hot heat so we said forget it the second time 😩 The first night on arrival when I tried to take a quick rinse/shower  the water stopped draining.

But other than that the room wasn’t dirty the sheets were clean that’s all I gave you guys sadly. And I’m not one to leave reviewed but I HAD to give the next people a heads up.

Also i mentioned it to the manager and she didn’t even offer anything she said “I’ll talk to house keeping “. Most other places would at the very least try to make up for the bad service to protect their standards .. not at all.

If I could do it again I would reserve at the other ocean front hotels. My partner and I checked out the other ones and they actually looked really nice and inviting like they wanted to earn guests. I guess these big name hotels feel like because they have the name they don’t have to try as hard now?

"Write a 1.0 stars Google Maps review about a Hotel, with the following keywords: hiltons, hilton, staff.","My family of 6 just finished a 5 night stay, to say we were underwhelmed is an understatement. We happen to be a hardworking blue-collar family, so when paying $629.00 a night for a suite at the Hilton, we were really excited to experience a stay that's above average to our typical Redroof or Days Inn stay. At arrival I was declined a military discount, not absolutely a deal breaker as I was told I was already receiving good deal by the front desk. Of course we were in town for a work conference and were also denied the block rate supposedly due to the fact that we had a suite (the only Accessible room available at the time of our reservation). Next, we arrived in our suite and had to use the restroom after our 16 hours of travel, only to find that housekeeping has definitely not done a very thorough job cleaning the toilet. Ok, fine. I pulled out some Clorox wipes and took care of it myself. At the same time, we noticed the room was excessively hot, so after settling in we called the front desk and notified them that the ac was not working, she said she would send an engineer up to check it out. At 230am when we still hadn't seen the engineer, we went to bed leaving the door open for a breeze to cool the room off. (The ac automatically turns off when the patio door is open, this was not the reason our ac was not working as we had complied with troubleshooting from the front desk) It wasn't until 2 more calls to the front desk and almost 2 days into our stay that the ac was worked on and worked at least enough to make the room bearable. Next up....showers, nothing like stepping out of a nice warm steamy shower to briefly look up when drying off and seeing black mold.......gross. Room service was not an option during our stay, a bit of a bummer as the kids were looking forward experiencing that. On the flip side we ended up dining down in the Don Ricos. It was a bit pricey at $14.00 for a pb&j sandwich with fries for the kids, needless to say there are lots of other options outside the Hilton for food choices and we made that choice for the remainder of our stay. The kid zone was non existent, the kids were really bummed about that as it was one of the reasons we had chosen to stay at the Hilton. The elevators were in a state of broken or in repair a couple times during our stay leading to extra long wait times to get to the lobby. We made our reservation for 6, had a suite for 6, paid the additional fee to have breakfast included but were informed it only included 4 so we didn't dine as a family for breakfast.

The good: At check in the kids were all given a fun craft to do, which they did and thoroughly enjoyed. Our request for extra towels and blankets was met quickly and our interactions with the staff were pleasant. The location was great as it's was very central for the things we needed to do. The beach was fantastic even though access was very limited due to damaged walk ways.  Last but most important, the unobstructed view of the ocean from our suite was fantastic.

Lesson learned, we won't be returning.

UPDATE: I called the number provided by the Hiltons response to my review. I was quickly forwarded to the manager on duty without any prolonged holding. Brooke I think, (I hope that's how her name is spelled) spoke with me for about 20 min as I recounted our stay with them and the reasons for my review. She was open to hearing what I had to say and did not discount or deny the experience we had, which was refreshing!

Overall it’s great if your main concern is beach access and amenities (rentals, vouchers, discounts at the shop, etc.).",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMHBDZGRBEAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hilton+Daytona+Beach+Oceanfront+Resort/@32.3925389,-86.2624499,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88e6da15b9f63f63:0x7f69da011a21aa8b!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d29.2302161!4d-81.0094812!16s%2Fg%2F113j35m45?hl=en",ChIJiZcZcKOTwIcRzVa-JYTxRX8,4.0
