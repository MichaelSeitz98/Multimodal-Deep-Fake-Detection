I am appalled at the quality of service and food at this place. While a family of Mexicans sitting next to us got served like royalty we were put on the back burner the waitress came over a total of three times while we were there. She also loved to flirt with her boss the whole time while ignoring us! We ran out of chips and salsa asked for more and didn't get any until after we got our food. When I got my plate. The portion was so small ! I had maybe 10 tiny pieces of meat and 4 pieces of shrimp on my dish which was the muscle maker . The lettuce was all brown and nasty. The avocado looked rotten. And not just a normal oxidation brown but it looked like it had been sitting and got rotten and they didn't care. Also only got like three slices of avocado. The dish looked nothing like the picture on the menu. I would have sent it back immediately but the waitress ran off and never even came back until it was to bring  the check. I didn't eat a bite of it and they tried to charge me for it until we talked to the manager! His excuse was they were training them. Yeah whatever. Never coming back here again.

"Very economical. This sampler I got had 4 different things on it using a big plate. For $3 more, you get a salad and drink. All said and done, about $12 for everything, and it was a ton of food. Service was great. Food was prepared quickly, very friendly people, and attentive to check up on you. Bread sticks (when dining in) are unlimited, and they come hot and fresh, buttered and seasoned with garlic. They are super soft and fluffy. Honestly, I rate their breadsticks above Olive Gardens. They are wonderful. Reasons why I’m not going with 5 stars, is nothing that this location has control over. It’s not a complaint of the individual location itself. First issue is, I felt the Alfredo sauce was very bland. I’ve had stuff out of a jar at home that beats it. Secondly, the amount of sauce (all 3 pastas had the same issue) they put on is very little compared to the noodles you get. My feeling is, I can buy a pound of uncooked noodles for $1 at the store. After they absorb the water, you’ve got 2lbs of noodles for $1. Commercially, they buy them much cheaper than that even. Noodles are incredibly cheap. Yet, you’re not really given enough sauce for them. Since pasta is so cheap, you’d think they could afford another 50 cents of sauce. The picture makes it look ok because it’s all on the top. It certainly looks like a decent amount of sauce. But you can’t see the noodle to sauce ratio. Also, I assume they have a pre-specified ladle size they are told to use. However, mix things up (or eat the top portion), and you’ll quickly find yourself eating plain noodles. Again, I’m sure this is a corporate thing, and not location specific, but you’re reading my review because you want an honest review, right? So, I’m going to tell my experience as it was. Over all, I’m giving it 4 stars still, as service is good, breadsticks are wonderful, and food was pretty good, aside from the lack of sauce. Go in there prepared with this info, and see what you think. And remember, those wonderful breadsticks... they are unlimited. They will keep bringing more if you want. And, you’ll likely want them to.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLa1A2Y1l3EAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Fazoli's/@42.5625955,-96.9852911,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x878dfff4ad86f2c3:0xe8ee06247c2fc9de!8m2!3d42.4367247!4d-96.3650302!16s%2Fg%2F11lgytsy77?hl=en",ChIJw_KGrfT_jYcR3skvfCQG7ug,Italian restaurant,4.0,Fazoli's,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvInS7CqLbU6owlayALHl3bV3IVsl8nVeWVyC-=w150-h150-k-no-p,restaurant

"Pretty decent little sandwich shop. They have hoagies, cheesesteaks, burgers, wings, and almost any other American type food. Tonight, I saw they had a great deal on Uber Eats offering buy 1 get one 1 free on select items. I decided to try the classic Philly cheesesteak, which also came with their hand cut fries (you also have the option of substituting chicken for steak).

The cheesesteak was about $12.50 each, which I think is an okay price. Portion size is decent too, not too big nor too small. I will say that there was quite a lot of bread in comparison to the meat, cheese, and vegetables. I believe the bun was too thick. The steak itself was pretty flavorful and had a good texture. They use an adequate amount of cheese. Good amount of mushrooms, and each mushroom is quite big, but they do have a slight canned flavor.

The fries were just okay. Quality probably declined due to them being in the car for delivery. Still, they were not bad, and definitely nice to get fries for free. As usual, I would have wanted a bit more salt or pepper, and they were a bit limp.

All in all, not a bad spot for a sandwich, wings, or other classic American fare. The cheesesteak was still enjoyable, just nothing special.

I'm only going to give the burgers a 2 out of 5.  The bun was double the size of the burger. The burger was dry, and the bottom of the burger was hard as if it was precooked and sitting. They didn't even ask or include any veggies for the burger.  No lettuce. No tomatoes.  No onions, and I paid 13 bux for this burger.

"SUPERB AUTHENTIC THAI in the Pittsburgh area, a short 15 min drive from downtown.  Cozy restaurant with no-touch menu, short and sweet. It looks a popular spot to locals of many persuasions. Takeout or sit in (I have done both), it’s simply excellent food. A FOODIE’S GEM.

Start with Fresh Rolls and Fried Eggplant, contrasting but complementary textures and sweet tangy sauces that wake up the palate (very much unlike the cliche peanut sauce in the run of mill Thai-style places.

Any of the curry entrees are very good, smooth well-balanced sauces; none of that pungent sugar-loaded curry so common in so-called Thai restaurants in this town.

My recommendation: Duck Curry, very crispy well seasoned perfectly cooked duck atop the smooth Red curry with bell peppers and cherry tomatoes, carefully balanced with two halves of lychee just enough to brighten the palate: Simply Wow!

Pair the curry with any of the Thai stir fry veggies.  I’m partial to the Hot Basil fry, extra veggies (natural sweetness of the fresh vegetables complemented with their brown sauce).

By the way, enjoy Thai food with a spoon rather than fork/knife. Spoon the curry or veggies on rice, mix, then enjoy. Spoon allows one to taste every drop of the sauce.

"Well, it wasn't anywhere NEAR as good as a few years back but the presentation was decent. Of course the prices went up, lol. An almost 3 star. Almost. Sadly I can NOT recommend  Thai Tamarind any longer since the flavors were incredibly weak and/or bland; so much tasted like it came from a jar and the top of the line ""thai spicy"" was a powder they sprinkled on top of every dish when presenting your level of spicy. Some of the powder hadn't fully dissolved during your meal so you would gets little clumps of it in your mouth. The ""so-called"" Thai Iced Tea I had tasted as if it were a syrup from a bottle. Yech!

Pictured you have the Tom Yum soup, Volcano Chicken and the Thai Style Chicken Noodle. All bland and weak. Not pictured but as an appetizer we had the chicken satay, another huge let down since when eaten with a homemade peanut sauce or cucumber sauce, it is DELICIOUS! The peanut sauce seems to have some type of dairy added to it. Gross.

Seated WAY in the back corner in the last pic you'll see your ""typical American Ken"", who did nothing but complain from he moment he sat down. Entitled as ""F"".

"I live directly up the street from this place on Washington Ave and I have got to say that I am absolutely disappointed with their quality of food.  Today, I just recently ordered their Pad Kee Mao and it looked like someone chewed up the meal and spit it right back out into the carry out tray.  The noodles were overly soggy and mushed up like mashed potatoes.  The salad that comes with the Lunch looks as if someone cut out a large chunk from a piece of lettuce, threw it into the tray, and then decided to splash a little sauce on top of it.

I don't normally complain about food and most times I simply ignore the mistakes but I've been living in Bellevue for 3 years now and this incident has happened more than once.  A customer can only be patient so many times and then there comes a point where a enough is enough.  This restaurant will never receive my services ever again.  I don't know if it's the cook or the management but the quality of food is poor.  Years ago the food was much better. I'm not sure what happened between then and now.

If you want a quality restaurant for Thai food, go to Niky's Thai Kitchen.  I promise you, Niky's Thai Kitchen is the better choice.  Their food quality is suburb compared to Thai Tamarind, especially for the price you'll pay for it.

"I've eaten there, and now I work there. So I get to see the food ""behind the scenes"". Most, if not all, is homemade in the sense that whoever the cook is, they will cook it their own way with their own ingredients like they would in their own home. So you get to try the same food about 4 to 5 different ways which I think is pretty awesome. The cooks take allergy warnings very seriously. The owners come in pretty much every day to make sure we dont stray off of the path that they made to build this restaurant and its food upon. We have SO many return customers that when they're off work they will hang out with us from open to close. We strive to be extra friendly and helpful! And our MANY return customers can verify.  We have 2 flat screens to watch your sports on or for your child to watch cartoons so you can eat with some peace (lol). Our food is great tasting. Certain waitresses will buy 4 to 5 bowls of homemade cream of crab soup to take home for the night. As an example. So if we trust the food enough to eat it AND buy it in bulk, I'm sure you will love your dinner! Since I started working 1 month ago, I have yet to hear not even one complaint. If I work somewhere that's not all that good, I'm not afraid to say so. So I promise I'm not on here because anyone told me to, or to try to gain more customers etc. I simply rated it because my phone noticed how often I come here and asked me to review it LOL.

"I went to an event that offering a free meal by a mattress salesman.
I personally wanted one of the lobster dinners they were advertising so I ordered it after the event was over.
It looked like the lobsters were old, sat out all day then microwaved. A $50/$60 tasteless plate. I sent it back and kept the free meal. That free meal was also tasteless. No seasoning on Anything.
That was an event offered there for several days.
That salesman had to have spent thousands!
My suggestion to him, find another restaurant if he ever came back to Pittsburgh. The best thing offered at Red Lobster that day was the bed because I bought one!!

"This is arguably the best sushi in Easton (maybe even the shore)! I've tried all the others and I keep coming back. The staff is friendly and always asks about my family when I come in alone. The wait for food is never long, even if the place is full. You can dine in at lunch and get back to work quick. The menu items consistently taste amazing and are prepared the same way everytime... there are no surprises, if you order an Olympic roll it's going to be amazing Every Single Time, and that surely can not be said for the other places in town. Some of my favorites are ""Amazing Tuna"" ""Jingle Bell"" ""Olympic"" ""Incredible"" and ""spicey crab"" but all of them are good.

"Enjoyed a nice breakfast today at Gaia. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. Our party of six was seated immediate on a Saturday morning.

Unpretentious, casual, warm interior. Small menu, but nice to have so many vegetarian and vegan options. Good to have the opportunity to try something different, outside the normal brunch fare.

I stuck with what I normally like - eggs & potatoes plus tried a fruit cup. It was a filling portion and cooked well. The potatoes were well seasoned and crispy. I also enjoyed the sourdough bread that came with my meal. The fruit was fresh and seasonal. Coffee was self-service and offered three options, with creamer available at request. I tried the Swiss chocolate brew and liked it a lot. My friend’s specialty French toasted looked amazing. It has tender sweet sautéed apples, cherry sauce, and almonds. Everyone had to try an apple slice - they were really good!

"Unfortunately I don’t have anything good to say about Gaia house . When we were sat down there was paint bubbling near us, probably due to moisture trapped behind the paint. And then a leak above. It’s not really an appetizing sight.

We were told that we wouldn’t be able to have espresso or lattes because the espresso machine was down. That’s fine. What I did take issue with was the self serve coffee station. For one, the way the glasses were stored was gross. The shelves were not clean. The cups were freshly washed. I could tell because they were wet, placed rim down. So that the dust and debris on the shelving was collected on the wet rims of the cups. And whenever you picked up a cup you could see the wet rim marked it left. These cups should be dry if you’re going to store them rim down. Drying them rim down traps the moisture inside (causing an unpleasant odor and taste), and damages the shelves, and is altogether unsanitary if the shelves aren’t even clean. Storing them rim side up would be a better option in this case . They are used often enough for collecting dust to be an argument for storing them rim side down. Sanitary conditions aside, for a vegan/vegetarian place for the only milk option to be whole milk was disappointing. Consider offering milk alternatives.

The food was even more disappointing . My guest ate his omelet , but I good not stomach my food. The cornbread French toast was incredibly dry, even soaking it in the butter and syrup didn’t revive it. The potatoes tasted fine but they were stale. Since it was the only semi edible thing available to me I picked at that instead of what I ordered. I only managed to eat half of one slice of French toast and didn’t want to take it home. We came out of our way to go here after seeing it on Instagram. So it was that much more disappointing.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dmN2VXRRRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gaia+House+Cafe/@42.956291,-85.9307035,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8819ad136992bf85:0x4337bf28a6cc5795!8m2!3d42.9907397!4d-85.6631991!16s%2Fg%2F11qrvs42ls?hl=en",ChIJhb-SaROtGYgRlVfMpii_N0M,Vegetarian restaurant,1.0,Gaia House Cafe,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGTV89EXPmi4xegegpQeq0ZqARuIAlRjID0pB7=w150-h150-k-no-p,restaurant
"Gaia House Cafe was very nice. The decor is slightly bohemian and very cozy with mismatched chairs and tables.We went on a Tuesday at lunch and got the Gaia Tempeh Ruben and the Banh Mi sandwiches.The coffee was excellent. The staff was very pleasant and the food arrived in good time. The price seemed a little steep for sandwiches but when you get homemade pickles and kraut it makes up for it. I couldn't tell where a good place to park would be, so we parked in the Irish pub reserved area with a risk of towing.

Some things to consider: add a bit more spread on the Banh Mi as it was a little dry; add a few completely vegan options to the menu as many of the entrees are so close but then have cheese; swap out those potato chips for a cup of soup.

"I loved this re-discovery recently! I vowed that if I ever noticed that Gaia Cafe was back  in any way I would maintain patronage as I used to frequent the Cafe when I was a student at Aquinas with friends and family as I maintained a vegetarian diet the majority of my time in attendance there. Thank you for coming back, I love the changes and the maintenance of staple favorites like B.Y.O.B. and Mean Green Burrito. I personally chose the Veggie Stash as recommended by my wonderful hostess (I selected the vegan options for cream cheese and cheese toppings as in recent years I have had to cut dairy out of my diet more fully). I had a lovely experience with the self service water and coffee, enjoying the flow of the community coming in and out of the Cafe as I spent a few hours there working on a few personal and professional goals and trying a new, but also nostalgic, meal.

I wanted to try the stuffed tortilla but weirdly the price on the online menu is $4 cheaper than when you go to actually order it online- a lot of menu items were the same way and I wonder if it's on purpose or if the online menu just needs to be updated? Instead, I got the mean green burrito and I loved how fresh it was- I love love love greens and veggies in a burrito and the tomatillo on top was superb.

This restaurant has to be the worst of the worst. The appearance and taste of the food has declined over the years but yesterday was the bottom. Breakfast foods were burnt the pancakes and hashbrows. The lunch items seemed to be better but onenof my guest became ill  upon eating the soup that they warm in the tray tables during breakfast.  Food was visibly dry and looked as if it was from yesterday.  The manager Mitch was rude and made bad claims upon my family when one person requested a refund upon eating the soup or salad that they became sick with.  However the  other manager reviewed  the cameras and provided her with refund.

We used to love coming to this place especially on a friday! Now a days days the food quality has dropped tremendously. The options of which they serve you is bare minimal or cold. Went to get meat on friday there is no special meats any longer. The ham and ribs were cold. Steak used be a better quality as well. Salad bar doesn't include bacon anymore? No mk or chocolate fountain. Only 2 pie selections. As I said the quality used to be better. All of these are things noticed by my child it's her favorite restaurant. My waitress was awesome ty Brittany. Over all the food was def not fresh all but the steak the options were slim and not very tasty. I tried a little of everything even the bourbon street chicken used to be better. I understand that sometimes business is slow but this was dinner rush 6 pm to 7pm .

"Rarely do I give a bad review ....but....
Disgusting.  If only zero stars were available.  Place needs a full cleaning. Maybe rip out disgusting carpet and try vinyl flooring... Plastic cutlery? Maybe since covid?   But had to ask for it vs getting at payment and entering.
Many tables were not wiped down without asking after awaiting a significant time. Unused tables stacked with piles of dishes. This st 4pm so not a full dinner rush.   I'd hate to see it during rush time.

The buffet had many empty pans due to non attention.

I've been  to several Golden Corral in many other major city centres. And this so far by far has been the worst!

"Today my family and I arrived at Golden Corral in Sterling Heights Michigan and were extremely disgusted with what we saw.

After paying (over $60) we finally found a table that was clean. When we went to the bar, we saw nothing but food thrown all over the floor, the bar was disgustingly dirty, and completely empty. Servers and the manager were just walking through the food all over the floor, never cleaning anything at all. It was so bad, I decided to take photos as well for you.

After sitting down, it took us 15 minutes to get silverware, and over 25 min to get drinks. Our server never cleared the plates from our table when needed either.

As for at the bar; the woman doing the steaks was more interested in flirting and trying to get a date with a customer than actually helping customers, cleaning anything, or even putting steaks on the grill. The salad bar was basically full of rotting fruit and slimy lettuce.

At the desert bar, there was chicken on the floor, food everywhere. My biggest concern was the fact that there were peanuts all over the bar, mixed into other toppings, on the cookies, on the brownies, etc. As someone with an extreme nut allergy, this type of cross contamination is deadly, let alone disgusting.

For $60 my family and I ate one plate of food that was cold by the time we got our silverware because the bar was empty and never refilled. I understand that places may be short staffed but that is not an excuse for any of this. If the health department would have walked in, the place would have been closed immediately….and honestly should have. When the manager, the staff, the servers, and guests are having to walk through food on the floor and nothing is being cleaned or refilled, that’s awful. We have been here several times and this is the most disgusting restaurant I have ever seen.

The photos shown below are just some of the photos I took.

The absolute best breakfast around. Huge portions for very reasonable prices. They have breakfast and lunch options. The waitresses are all very friendly and work to help each other out.

"I love the Peppermill. They have great food with surprising variety at low prices. I had the inside out grilled cheese. It has baby Swiss, cheddar, tomato, red onion, and avocado on parmesan crusted bread. It was amazing. The onion was flavorful and the creamy avocado made the two melted cheeses even better. The parmesan added another layer of crispness to each bite. I upgraded to tater tots instead of chips, and I was surprised at the large portion. My daughter had a pancake and tots. The pancake was huge, so she only managed half, but she did polish off her tots and some of mine. This was my second time there recently.

"You can consider LA CREME your go-to spot for small batch, organic artisan crepes. The Canela and Citron crepes are our favorites. Make sure to order them with strawberries.

The difference, as with most great restaurants, starts with using excellent ingredients. When we spoke to Kim, the owner of LA CREME, she explained that their toppings are either made in-house or sourced from high quality bakers and such is the whipped cream — a delicious level of thickness with the right amount of sweet.

You can feel the attention to details in the decor. It’s down to earth with an elegant use of black and white with splashes of rose gold among the perfectly socially-distanced tables.

The staff is young, precise, and welcoming.

Overall a great experience that can rival those in Napa, where we’ve been going for years.

One small change I would suggest is upgrading the coffee creamer. Pleased do away with the plastic containers.

"La Creme is a chic creperie located on Main St in Zeeland. The space is bright and airy which makes for the absolute cutest place to have brunch!!

The wonderful thing about La Creme is that they have both sweet AND savory crepes!! If you wouldn’t call yourself a sweet tooth, then you are in luck because their menu includes some crazy amazing savory crepe options!

Their savory crepes are also naturally gluten-free: BONUS!

And it is SO FUN to watch them make the crepes as they add in all of the yum that it’s filled with and then fold it into a delicious MASTERPIECE 💫

Because I meannnn do you SEE how beautiful those are?! 🤩

While their main focus is crepes, La Creme also offers everything from yogurt bowls to smoothies to coffee to boba to macaroons to pastries and EVEN MORE!!

"This was our anniversary and we wanted to celebrate with fine tasting Italian food. This was it! Outside on their patio, sipping a tasty, tart cocktail and a nice Barbera red. We love caprese and adding basil pesto is a keeper. The Tuscan Nido was perfect-handmade and hands down the largest ravioli-the added surprise of an egg yolk hidden inside was genius!

"Came here originally on my birthday last year . The food is just amazing. The chef / owner is from Italy and knows how to cook. The homemade pastas were amazing , the staff knew what kind of wine my wife needed , as their wine menu was very overwhelming. Huge wine menu lol .

My wife wanted come back on Valentine’s Day weekend on a Saturday , and it was such a lovey experience ..... we started with the fried calamari. It was crunchy and tender. Got a nice $30 of Cabernet and it was smooth. I don’t really drink wine but I was able to drink a whole bottle with wifey . Next we got a shrimp / crab dish and 4 cheese ravioli. Outstanding entrees. Didn’t look like much but we were very stuffed . Last was our lime something cake ....

We did come at 8pm so the crowd died down so our service was pretty spot on .

Love love love this place !

***updates*** 12/21/2020

Just came here on a Monday for my bday and it was perfect ! When we got there at 6pm there was only us and another table. We practically had the restaurant for a good 30 minutes to ourselves . Usually this place is packed but probably due to covid it has slowed down. They closed their larger dining area. We had a bottle of wine , few appetizers , and two main courses ! Our food was awesome ! And service was great ! Wish it was busier so the restaurant stays in business.

Meatballs and the sauces were very good!!! The other entrees portions are all too big. Seafood risotto was not bad, I would prefer the seafood not cooked so much that they were a bit chewy.

We all laughed over the one giant piece of ravioli, that was not expected. It smelled really good and was told that it tasted very good too.

I went with the lasagna, as I also do, on my first visit to an Italian restaurant and it did not disappoint.  We had also ordered a beef carpaccio appetizer for the table that was quite excellent.

"Excellent service, friendly staff, huge wine list and tasty food. We had a great bottle of Chianti. Then we split the calamari and caprese. The calamari was perfectly cooked, not chewy at all. I saw the guy in the kitchen breading it. The caprese was honestly one of the best I've had. Being winter, the tomato wasn't the best but the mozzarella was perfect. It was topped with a delicious pesto. And the plate was drizzled with the thickest balsamic glaze I've ever had. It was almost like caramel. The balsamic glaze was extremely flavorful. For our main courses, we had the Tuscan Nido and the wild mushroom Tagliatelle. The Tuscan Nido was basically a giant ravioli. The filling had great flavor. I loved the pops of whole peppercorn and the fried sage leaves. The pasta was clearly homemade and perfect. The wild mushroom Tagliatelle was even better. The mushroom flavor was amazing and the smell was just divine. Normally, I would have liked to see the addition of truffle to a dish like this but honestly, I think it was near perfect without. The mushrooms just had such good flavor. To top off our meal, the lady who seated us came around to see how our meal was. Based on our conversation, I assume she was the owner.

"Myself and 5 friends went tonight to celebrate our good friend's engagement and wedding coming up next month with something a little different! We had an amazing time, the food was totally different than what we normally would find but so good, we had a ton of fun picking out our meals, trying all the different things, and just enjoying the experience. The wait staff was phenomenal, I honestly think Allison was a highlight of our evening. She was very personable, made us feel entirely comfortable, and had great tips and information on the menu.

We were gifted with extras at dessert, champagne for those of us that partook in cocktails and N/A sparkling juice for those that didn't and it was SO good! Super refreshing! We also (seriously, they were so amazing) were gifted a bite of something delicious - I apologize for not remembering what it was by the pastry chef this evening - but it had almonds, was a dessert bar of some sort and it was really good - not super sweet, honestly would have gone great with coffee if any of us had room for it - which we most certainly did not.

The atmosphere was wonderful, even being in proximity to other tables it still felt intimate enough that we couldn't hear other parties' conversations, nor could they hear ours, and I feel like we were a little rambunctious at times. Also, my friends that had cocktails said nothing but high praise for them - my coke with lime was also top notch * in case anyone cared ;)

Food. That's why you're reading this, yeah?
It was good. Like, really great. It also felt like a performance at times. Lots of fun pouring, super attentive taking items away, never once had to ask for anything, be it water, napkin, silverware, etc etc. Maybe we're cheap dates but I'm fairly certain everyone went above and beyond, exceeding our expectations. Thanks for a great experience!

In case my photo captions don't save:
1. Scallops
2. Surprise Carrot & Cardamom Soup option (big fan of this, you don't know unless you KNOW)
3. Beef Medallion Filet - my favorite of the 3 savory dishes
4. The best dang dessert option there is - even though the mousse looked and sounded amazing - I will DIE on this chocolatey-citrus hill any day. Any. Day.

"Really enjoyed our visit here. We came here for the annual fall mushroom dinner and got to taste a great spread of delicacies and unique mushrooms. We enjoyed about 18 different mushrooms blended into our 6 course meals paired with wine! Everything was delicious.

This was our first time here and glad we decided to be here to enjoy the special evening. We got seated right away and the staff were so polite. We also had some food restrictions and our server attended to us right away addressing that. He just made us feel very comfortable and ensured us that the request has been taken care off.

We visited here for dinner but I would love to visit here again during the day because based on the location, it overlooks the beautiful Lake Michigan and I can only imagine how gorgeous the view would be from the hill top! It's an upscale restaurant and is great for special occasions! They offer a lot of speciality themed dinners (just like the mushroom one) so I would really recommend joining in for one of those if you get a chance!

"Our wedding at Lake Park Bistro was absolutely perfect. We had a tented reception with cocktail hour on the gorgeous East Balcony with stunning views of Lake Michigan. The restaurant's white pillars were a perfect location for photos and the surrounding park offered more beautiful options all with in a walking distance. The staff was fantastic and our guests were thrilled with their prompt and friendly service. We also received many, many compliments on the food from our family and friends; even those ‘hard to impress’ said their meal at Lake Park Bistro was the best they’d ever had at a wedding. However, the best thing about Lake Park Bistro was working with Dan. He made us feel comfortable and welcome every step of the way and provided us with excellent advice to make our day fun and stress-free. Dan was clear in all of our communications and went above and beyond to host a meeting for myself and my other vendors. His honest feedback and recommendations helped make our day personal, special, and truly, the best day of our lives. We truly can not say enough about our wonderful experience at Lake Park Bistro, thank you Dan and team!!

"I thought my mom and I would have really enjoyed this restaurant, but we were a bit underwhelmed and feel that Le Reve in Tosa and Pastiche in downtown are better options in Milwaukee for French cuisine.

Things we liked:
—the view of Lake Michigan
—free parking!
—the butter (kinda random, but it was really good!)
—the wine pairings for the Menu de Chef
—the service from our waiter’s assistant (I think her name was Michelle)
—my dessert, which was an Earl Grey pot de creme with honey brittle and lavender chantilly creme. The bright, lemony Riesling was a perfect pair.

Things we didn’t care for:
—our waiter made the same spiel for the specials at every table and became a broken record.
—the soup l’oignon was so-so, a little too sweet
—the entrees could have used more vegetables to brighten up the plate
—my filet was well-done when I ordered it rare, but they were quick to fix that
—noisy in our room and was difficult to maintain conversation
—we got a bit of a pretentious air to the place

"LPB has been our favorite for a long time and we we're thrilled to learn they re-opened. The service was stellar and VERY safe however we were not quite thrilled with our  food. It was almost as if the kitchen has an entirely new staff.. perhaps new suppliers/wholesalers??  My Oeuf Mollet avec Champignons des Bois was prepared differently, the mussels were definitely different. And my favorite fois gras dish has a new bland fruit or vegetable to accompany it vs the old one which was a sweet fruit that was such a great compliment to such a savory protein. Lastly,  I had a lobster entree that was prepared in a ""beef stock"" like base... Almost like it should have accompanied beef vs. fresh lobster. I hate to sound harsh but I am just being honest.  And FYI the menu is now a set 3 or 4 course menu. We will certainly come back however having eaten here so many times for so many special occasions.. we were a bit disappointed compared to any previous visit.  One last note.. just a thought... Why is it I cannot find a desert chef in Milwaukee who makes Panna Cotta? The last time we found it was at Chistopher's (now closed/new owner perhaps) in Sister Bay. That was approximately 10 years ago..I will finish by staring the lemon desert we had was excellent!!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbThTb2dRRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bartolotta's+Lake+Park+Bistro/@43.0681646,-87.8696183,7z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x880518b0b0118bf3:0x44fd3ac98f9dbd80!8m2!3d43.068329!4d-87.8692499!16s%2Fm%2F0zf59b8?hl=en",ChIJ84sRsLAYBYgRgL2dj8k6_UQ,Bistro,3.0,Bartolotta's Lake Park Bistro,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2JXrr0hnnaweUAMRBgAoetRYs8wzGF5DsoHg5=w150-h150-k-no-p,restaurant

"This is truly a hidden gem!

They have a dance group anyone can join; it's been very fun! Wednesdays at 7PM, except for the 2nd Wednesday each month.  I have literally no dance background, but this is folk dancing, so that's fine 😁

Edelweiss is located in German Park at the end of the drive.  The park itself isn't anything major, but the scenery is very nice.
Once at the parking lot, you can go in the main entrance and down the stairs to the restaurant or follow the sidewalk north of the building where it slopes down and around the building to their outdoor seating. You can see a gnome garden along the way!
I've seen comments saying this place isn't handicap accessible, but this sidewalk is the entrance to take if you have a wheelchair or stroller.  Understandably, this will be inconvenient if it is raining.
The outdoor seating is the beer garden area and the doors lead into the restaurant.

On Wednesdays there is a buffet.  I'm writing this review after a stop at their buffet and I'm impressed.
On Fridays they have live music; simply amazing fun!

They have several events through the year and I definitely recommend checking them out! Frühlingsfest, Jägerfest, Octoberfest and more!

Through the year, they have several German events, including an Octoberfest.  From what I hear, it's a blast!

Additionally, a local Duolingo group has started holding language events here and, separately, there is a lady who gives basic German lessons in the fall.

"This place is amazing.  Talk about taking yourself back in time for a minute you feel like you are in Germany.  They open at 5pm for dinner only.  You drive down this  dark road, and you would never know there was a parking lot and a restaurant from the top of the road.
You go inside from the parking lot on a top level,  down a flight of  stairs is the restaurant.  They do have an elevator for handicap.
Once below it's amazing.  It's small probably about 30 tables, wooden walls, and all decorated with Germany memorabilia.
I was so excited to try this place the last time I had German food was in Germany 20 plus years ago.  I still remember what that tasted like.
There was 2 waitress serving and taking orders. Lisa was our waitress.  She is such a nice lady,  and definitely knows her menu,  and has worked their for a long time.  I ordered the German beer on tap it was very light, clear, and refreshing. My other half Bayrischer Schweinebraten it was a tender slow roasted pork shoulder.  I tasted the dish and it was amazing.  Very tender and with lots of flavor.  It was not sliced it was more like chunk pork. His side was the sliced apples.  I have never tried apples sliced fresh, in a cinnamon sauce.  I wish you could order this by the pint or quart to take home.  Amazing!
I ordered Jägerschnitzel which was delicious with the cream white wine sauce, and mushroom.  The sauce was so good I asked for a little more sauce. The pork meat was tender, and a nice slice. My sides was potato pancakes oh my goodness hold the fork these were not greasy at all.  I put the sour cream and applesauce on the potato cakes. My other side I was wanting to try was the German potato salad.  It was good, completely traditional,  but not my favorite for my taste buds. Before dinner you have a choice of soup or salad.  I definitely tried the soup which was really good the traditional red cabbage soup.
I can't wait to come back to try more dishes.
For dessert if you have room definitely order the bread pudding with the warm whiskey sauce.  You will want to make room for this dessert.
We were getting ready to leave, they were closing, and they were so nice they make everything fresh daily, and had extra apple and cherry turnovers. I had taken home 1 of each. The next day with a cup of coffee, warmed up,  very good.
I can't wait to come back!

The cheese is definitely the best part of this place however my one complaint is that it come out in plastic salad dressing containers.

"The husband and I have decided to set off and try a new place where we have never ate before every Friday for date night, with that being said we found ourselves here. My first impression wasn't bad at first. It was very beautiful when we walked in. A little confusing because you choose if you'd like to eat in the Diner or Pub and each menu was a tad different (as they did show us) but I was still confused so I just said Diner so we could get to eating. After about a 20 minute wait we was finally placed into a corner but at this point I didn't care, I was just ready to eat. We ordered our drinks and appetizers, those took about 15 minutes to receive. I immediately noticed that the glass was dirty, still at this point I'm trying to stay positive. I calmly wait as we wait for our waiter to come back so I can express my concerns to him unfortunately he took about 20 minutes before he came back in that 20 minutes we watched others get drinks numerous times and their food as we still set there waiting to just get one more drink, at this point I'm getting annoyed. Right about then a manager walk by and I expressed my concerns to her and she immediately address the issue. We finally receive our food from our original waiter and to be honest the burger was okay it didn't have much flavor at all but at this point I'm still trying to stay positive and look at the positive like at least the fries are good right? Just overall not a good experience I don't think I would ever go back there again the manager however did come up to us and offer us a free dessert to take home and we kindly took it home with us to enjoy later.

"This review is for Winston’s pub.

Writing a review is a pain in the toto. I avoid it as much as possible. But this place deserves it.

There is a reason why this place is still #1:

- The bar section is nice a quiet.
- Their alcohol selections are thoughtful. There are 2 non-alcoholic beers. There is a local Michigan vodka, etc.
- I asked the server about a strange looking bottle and she got me a sample. How sweet.

"I want to begin by saying I really love the atmosphere. The tables are spaced out enough that there is not much noise and it’s easy to talk to your table. The interior decoration is also very beautiful. There is not much parking but I live close so I walked. The food was delicious but there were just enough weird things that made me give 4 instead of 5 stars. The bread and butter (which is its own appetizer) is OK but definitely not anything to write home about, the butter pat was cold so not easily spreadable. I ordered the cauliflower main dish with sauce and golden raisins knowing it would be lighter than a meat main. However, with the price of the dish, I was expecting a bit more than 1/4 of a cauliflower head for my main meal. I know inflation and prices are high but cauliflower? Seems they could’ve spared a bit more. Additionally the olive oil cake with rhubarb and strawberry ice cream was good but the ice cream stole the show! The cake itself was just ok and the rhubarb had not been sweetened enough to make it palatable, I ended up taking it off. The service was good but not great, we had a new server and she made a few missteps that ultimately would have cost our party money if we hadn’t spoken up (as opposed to slow service, etc).

I mention all of this because the bar, from the moment you walk in the door, is set very very high. And the food is great. It's just not quite as beautiful as the decor or as perfect as the menu describes.
The tostones are plentiful and the brussel sprouts are crispy. But the sauces leave something to be desired.
The steak and lamb were excellently cooked but greens and asparagus needed a little more flavor.

"Fantastic interior layout, private dining area from the bar. My brother and I came here for dinner he was in town and I haven't been here yet so we decided to try it. Food was interesting to say the least, we got the CALABRIAN CHILI CUCUMBERS for an app and it was more tangy like pickled cucumbers. Still very refreshing. I got the SWEET CORN AGNOLOTTI  , charred corn very sweet with shredded crab mix, pretty good however needed a little salt added.
My brother got BRAISED PORK BELLY, cooked an amazin crispy skin , however, this one was overly salted. Not bad but our palette was interesting.
Then we ended with dessert CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE and Seasonal Truffles (3)
By far my favorite I've tried, subtle , flavor isn't overpowering (I don't have that much of a sweet tooth) would definitely get the dessert again! The truffles was alright, dark chocolate and white chocolate. Tasted really nice.

Mushroom kushiyaki and charred avocado for a starter. Then, egg yolk raviolo and chicken roulade for our main course. Delicious on all counts.

I've had plenty of those in my lifetime and this one was a new twist. Two different kinds of Espresso and tiramisu liqueur woke me up and provided just the right amount of decadence.

"Everything from start to finish was fantastic! The onion soup was flavorful and did not need the Gruyère cheese, but the cheese made it better. Perfect for a cold winter night! The steak tartare was also flavored well with peppers and the perfect ratio to the sauce. The chips made it even better. The duck breast matched well with the parsnip purée and was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The flavor profile had a gamier edge. The portion sizes were generous, and there were extra duck pieces mixed in with the vegetables. The cocktails were a delight: my old fashioned had a clear, custom cut ice cube that added to the aesthetic charm. The drink tasted better over time as the ice melted.

I ordered the grilled chicken mezze salad and it was beautiful, but also delicious. The duck fat truffle fries were also phenomenal.

He even sent our server, Olivia, out to double check that multi grain bread was ok for the grilled cheese. Olivia was a wonderful server as well and knew everything about the menu, and the owner was there at the host stand greeting people as they came in.

"Good food at a good price👍🏻
We were coming from the Loess Bluffs Wildlife Refuge.
We did come in the late afternoon, so the location was not busy.
The staff that we encountered was efficient, but not cheerful, but not rude either.
The atmosphere was not overly welcoming and dim lighting. It was a cloudy day, so maybe they rely on sunshine to help out?
The location was clean and restrooms were clean, with no baby changing station in the women's room.

"I would’ve given this place a two star review, however, I brought it down to one star because of the waitress who served us. First and foremost, they do have really good wings. Let’s start off with the good. The not so good, was the service and the burgers. I did not enjoy my burger whatsoever. It was greasy and absolutely disgusting. The waitress clearly saw that I only took one small bite of my burger and never even questioned whether I liked it or not or if they could remake it. Still charged me full price & that was truly disappointing. Basic customer service adequate, would be to ask the customer if they enjoyed their food or how things were? But she clearly she did not.

"My wife and I stopped here for lunch following a trip to Chriskindlemart.

We were quickly greeted by the hostess and or waitress Kim came over to us to take our order relatively quickly. She greeted us with a smile in a very friendly manner.

We both ordered the strawberry lemonade which is a great thirst quencher. For appetizers,  we shared the crab dip and brown butter buffalo wings which were delicious.

For meals, my wife had the crab cakes with brussel sprouts and the bacon twice baked potato. She said the crab cakes were very good but said the brussel sprouts,  although extremely tasty and flavorful,  were not fully cooked and were somewhat hard. She also said the twice baked potato filling was very good, but the skin of the potato was very hard and overcooked.

I had the butter garlic strip steak medium well with the broccoli, potato wedges and the stuffed potato.

The steak was served already sliced, and although not a huge problem, not something that I prefer. It was slightly over cooked. To me, medium well it's slightly pink in the center (serving temp around 160*) but it was cooked well done. Also, the menu says roasted garlic and herb butter. I didn't sense any butter on it and it came with quartered garlic on top. The wedges were very tasty and seasoned nicely as was the stuffed potato.

For dessert we had the funnel cake fried Oreo's which was delicious!

The presentation of all the food was exceptional. The cleanliness of the restaurant was superb. There wasn't a time when we didn't see someone cleaning.

Lastly, the food was not very expensive for the portions.

"Came on this vacation to check out local animal sanctuaries and get a few experiences in with wild animals. The San Antonio Zoo shows a lot of love with its exhibit design. The terrariums are well-designed and the animals seem pretty content where they are. The animals have places where they can hide if they're stressed, which may irritate some zoo-goers, but I'm glad that the Zoo gave them that. Some of the birds are also just hanging around freely within the park! The cool zones were all really neat, and a nice way to get out of the heat.

"I love the zoo. However this year's zoo lights was very disappointing. Not many kiosks were open.  Lights were okay. Worse, Cocoa was $12 each and Santa pictures were $36 or $42...  previous years you could take your own picture with Santa and the experience was much more fun with Santa and his elves.  Providing more engagement and even jokes. I felt more like a customer at Walmart than a visitor of a venue.

"We've been season pass holders for many years, and I just want to say that I appreciate that the zoo tries really hard to have engaging events each month. There are some sections with minimal shade,  so in Texas,  that means it can get REALLY HOT. I wish there were misting fans or little shaded canopies, especially in places where there are tables... but the employees are helpful, the newly refurbished kids area (as of 3/25 it still has some construction in that area) is fun. I just wish there were more seating places for parents. My daughter is going on 8, and has been going since she was just a baby... overall,  it's a great place for families, especially seeing and knowing our zoo is one of the leading zoos for endangered birds.

They have taken advantage of San Antonio's rocky terrain to create some very well landscaped animal enclosures for all of the animals as well as having trees, flowers, cactuses, and ponds laid out throughout the zoo. It was kind of a cold and rainy day the day we went and a lot of the animals were not having any part of it electing to sleep out of the weather in their enclosures, but we still enjoyed it very much! They have a nice reptile house with lots of snakes, lizards, and turtles. They also have a sea life house that has both fresh water and salt water fish and turtles! There are plenty of refreshment stands spaced out around the grounds as well as restrooms and hand wash stations.

The zoo train does NOT take you through the zoo so be aware of that prior to ticket purchase. Also the train seating is very cramped. Otherwise a fun place.

"Fantastic zoo! I think they have every animal here. It was so many from all over the world, some I never heard of. There are also interactive experiences such as feeding the giraffes and petting kangaroos. You will have to pay for these things, which turned me off a bit since I think the zoo makes money from so many other things. There is also a kiddie amusement park right next to the zoos if parents want to find other ways to amuse their kids. I highly suggest you buy a Groupon or find some other site that would allow you to get a discount. I didn’t and paid the full price of $31.00 and I wasn’t pleased.

"The zoo was awesome today!! Only because we went 2 weeks ago with the whole family (9 total) to see the zoo lights and missed out on all the attractions. We went at 4:25 to feed the girraffes and they ran out of food. So I took my sister back today, she's visiting for her birthday and went straight to the giraffes. She had so much fun feeding them!  ($5.00 for lettuce)  Feeding is between (2-4:30) then we stopped to feed the birds ($3.00 only til 4:30) So much laughs with the birds on our heads and arms. Then straight to ride the camel. Its on my sisters bucket list. She rode Coco so sweet ($10.00 rides until closing) We also found out once a month residents are only $8.00 so that's great to know in the future! We had a blast . We also ate at the Bistro restaurant, hot dog and fries($8.00) it was way better than the food booth and I think the same price.  Tickets to feed the giraffes, ride the camel and feed the birds are all purchased at the site not when you purchase the main ticket to the zoo. Have fun!

"It’s our fault for going during spring break so it was extremely crowded but even if it wasn’t crowded it’s not a very accessible zoo if you bring a stroller or wagon or if you have a wheel chair. It was hard to navigate through especially not knowing some areas are basically only one way. The biggest problem I had was the ticket prices being extremely different than on the website, 21.95 for adult vs 35$ at the zoo and 17$ for kids vs 25$ at zoo, maybe I missed something on the website about the prices being different but that is so much different I don’t think that’s right at all.  We were extremely disappointed that we spent $120 to have trouble navigating and even seeing the animals and most animals are in very small enclosures.

On a real note, this place was great. It’s not a large zoo (don’t even try to compare to San Diego zoo) but it had so much to offer. Hippos, elephants, rhino, lions, reptiles, snakes, birds, and lots more. We bought the fun day passes which included day passes to the park, train tickets, feeding a lory tickets, and the carousel tickets. The train is a miniature version the takes a stroll through the nearby nature park. Feeding the lorys is pretty cool, they give you a cup with nectar and the birds land on your arms, shoulders, head, pretty much everywhere. Then once the nectar runs out they start licking you. The carousel is a carousel with animals you ride, it’s is made for kids but that didn’t stop me.

Overall this park was small enough to see just about everything in about 1/2 of a day. It does have inclines and declines but a nice easy hike around the park.

"The San Antonio Zoo is a family affair for certain. The first zoo I ever went as a child was here. I brought my kids here when they were little and now their little ones have visited. Overall, the zoo is in many ways the same as it always been. Tucked just outside of the downtown area adjacent to Breckenridge Park the zoo is a nice little visit and worth going to. The price of the zoo admission does not include all exhibits, so be prepared in the event that you think otherwise. To me, this is the only reason I wouldn’t give it 5 stars. I certainly don’t recall this being the case years ago, but perhaps this is to help keep the cost of the base admission to a more reasonable cost. Even with this in mind, don’t hesitate to go.

"It has been a few years since qe have been to San Antonio zoo...specifically zoo lights. We oved it! Some differences I noticed was kiddie park moved to right by the zoo and the train made no other stops other than the main station. It didn't seem to be a big deal to buy tix in advance. There should be aine for people who have their hand stamped for re entry. A few times we were stuck behind very large groups of people waiting to check in for the day. We had a digital code that was scanned from my phone for initial entry. Purchsed online beforehand. People who paid at the kiosk had a digital code as well. Members seemed to ha r thw most trouble entering. I have no idea why.
Another thing that kind of stunk was my inlaws needed to rent scooters which was right before the scanned entry....after my barcode wad scanned, we were given our fun pass cards to ride the train, feed the Lorries and ride the carosel...sooooo we had to loop around the first part of the zoo...get out hands stamped...ask if they scooter people could watch our scooters while we exited to go ride the train...if you need a rent a scooter  a stroller just save yourself the trouble and ride the train first if you were there for zoo lights. The train stopped running at 5 pm..probably everyday however the nighttime experience made it tricky.
We loved the carosel!! The light ahow amd musoc wasn't as awesome as two years ago. The music was quieter unless you were right near the speakers. The camel ride was so short. 2 years ago we paid like 25 and the kids got to around a huge area like 3 times. So 10 bucks and shorter ride time makes up for it I guess. We probably won't do that again however we will go again. Zoolights is my fave!
The kangaroo petting experience was the best addition ever!!! It was not an option 2 years ago so maybe it began last year. I will do that every time! Loved the new giraffe and rhino areas! And Pantera's walk was spectacular. There seemed to be a lot more Christmasy things for kids this year!

"We love coming here. We got to try our first butter beer at the dragon forest. Though the forest itself wasn’t worth the extra $$.  Felt bad for the animals that were there by themselves separated from the zoo. The butterfly experience is our favorite. The kids enjoyed the rides at the kiddy park.  We did breakfast with the giraffes. I took 2 stars off for that. Though the food was good and I love that the money goes for conservation, the way they handled the actual going to feed the giraffes lacked clear direction. This lack of direction created a free for all situation that was frustrating and infuriating which took away from the magic of the experience.

"I’ve lived in San Antonio since 2006 and have only visited the zoo once previously with my family… I had fond memories of that trip.

Upon returning from five years being stationed overseas, I was shocked that the admission was now up to $30 per person…

As others have mentioned, the first impression is that most of the animals are inside their enclosures /  out of sight of the public… starting with the bears at the very front of the zoo. Ditto on most of the public displays. Other large sections of the zoo were under construction. Public areas generally seemed clean and kept up.

Some of the exotic birds in the birdhouse looked stressed and were in much too small of an enclosure, the birds in outdoor enclosures seemed to fare better.

I ended up only staying about an hour due to the heat of the day and the fact it was so crowded (I was wearing my mask but saw few others wearing any).

I don’t mind paying to support the zoo/city but at least try to provide alternate exhibits if none of the advertised animals are present.

The dinosaur exhibit looked like a really neat draw but I saw more dinosaurs than zoo animals today…",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxeTVPTWZBEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Antonio+Zoo/@30.4786865,-105.8819976,6z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x865cf59ad8dd658d:0x29d4de62fd5bc2a4!8m2!3d29.4623904!4d-98.4737232!16s%2Fm%2F027j95d?hl=en",ChIJjWXd2Jr1XIYRpMJb_WLe1Ck,Zoo,3.0,San Antonio Zoo,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSVIQwUlHED2niwULJUzUsDmDDd9D1HSeNG4W8=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"By far one of the best zoos I've been too. It's expensive, but it's so big and there's ton of interaction between and during the exhibits. The have a vast variety of animals. Fun kid play area too, tons of birds, feed the giraffes and hippos!

Wish they had a gorilla or two, but they have a ton of other little monkeys.

Also, pictures while feeding the giraffes is a rip off. They print the pictures out and show them to you, tell you it's $45 and if you say no, throw them in the garbage. Waste. Should be like $5 since you're already printing them, spent hundreds (depending on party size) to get into the zoo, and it's just a waste if you don't sell em.

"This review is mainly about the new dragon forest! And oh man what an awesome edition to our local zoo! This place has grown so much and with all the new attractions it’s made it so much more dynamic. Almost all of the dragons moved and I from of each one they had displays saying what part of the world the dragon was from. My only complaint is that sometimes the special events and tickets or info can be hard to get a hold of. The dragon forest is located directly behind the new parking garage but for the life of me I could not find anywhere online where I should park. I ended up parking right by the zoo and to make the hike up hill to the back of the parking lot. My son and I attended the event for “dragon alley” which is supposed to be a play on words for the infamous “diagon alley” in Harry Potter. I’m sure the zoo knew all the Harry Potter fans would come out, and we did. They advertised there would be butter beer but they only had one stand. The line was so long! Like over and hour in the heat. We ended up just grabbing iced coffee from Starbucks and taking the train ride around the zoo.

A great zoo! We went during this past winter and just a few weeks ago and if you can manage go during the winter! As the weather gets warmer and schools let out it gets more and more packed. They have giraffe feedings and mole close up encounters that you can pay extra for. They even have a food truck there for lunch. They have just about every animal and a huge bird community. I would recommend wearing your walking shoes and hitting up the botanical gardens nearby.

The views of all the animals is great.  The walk all the way around is worth your time.

The zoo has so many animals you can spend at least 2-3 hours looking at all the animals they have. They also have information on all the animals there habitats what they eat and much more. They just started putting up animatronic dinosaurs up which are super cool for smaller kids. I would recommend the zoo to anyone one that likes outdoors and animals.

Not much shaded area tho so be prepared to sweat some gallons. The people were extremely friendly and seemed to actually be happy to be a work. Many sanitizing stations throughout the zoo as well. Free parking and a Starbucks right in the parking lot just waiting for ya....,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDanNPTDJnRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Antonio+Zoo/@30.4786865,-105.8819976,6z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x865cf59ad8dd658d:0x29d4de62fd5bc2a4!8m2!3d29.4623904!4d-98.4737232!16s%2Fm%2F027j95d?hl=en",ChIJjWXd2Jr1XIYRpMJb_WLe1Ck,Zoo,3.0,San Antonio Zoo,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-1WRaTADTDZ8Q2l8qBQLoTCrkCfkQcBZz3dWt=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

Great place to visit. Concession lines were extremely long and moved very slow. The a few concession stands sold adult beverages and others didn't. The reason I'm rating a 4 star is cause I waited 20 minutes in line for a drink to get to the front of the line and be told that they don't sell beer. None of the concessions had signs letting you know whether they sold adult drinks or not.

"In the past the Zoo was not the best (see my review from years past) the San Antonio Zoo has put a great effort into making the zoo the best that it can be and is doing a great job in the past few years. I highly recommend this zoo at this time.

I visited many zoos in my past. I grew up in N. E. Ohio and went to the Cleveland Zoo many times every year from birth till 18yrs and then I visited every couple of years, I've visited the Pittsburgh Zoo multiple times in my life, I've visited the Asheboro NC Zoo multiple times, I've visited the Virginia zoo, I've visited the Washington D. C. zoo, I've visited Disney Animal Kingdom and I've been to many super small side of the road places that call themselves zoos or Aligator /Reptile farms. I've seen a lot and have much to compare. The San Antonio Zoo needs some help. The animal habitats for many of the larger animals are not large enough and many of the outdoor habitats are somewhat overgrown and look like the animal couldn't be living in there but they are. The small animals are living pretty well and the zoo is clean and you can tell that it's a fight for the zoo staff to stay up on the upkeep. It's time to update or down size and give a few animals the space and care they deserve. Look to the Virginia Zoo. The Virginia Zoo is about this size but has put a lot of effort into the beauty of the park and great habitats for the small amount of animals that they have. Please do better San Antonio Zoo",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURROFpXRGlRRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Antonio+Zoo/@30.4786865,-105.8819976,6z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x865cf59ad8dd658d:0x29d4de62fd5bc2a4!8m2!3d29.4623904!4d-98.4737232!16s%2Fm%2F027j95d?hl=en",ChIJjWXd2Jr1XIYRpMJb_WLe1Ck,Zoo,4.0,San Antonio Zoo,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjeJrvD2H4ppgwbelrc6-boYxivzqhBn1KcQHn=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"Absolutely terrific time during the holiday zoo lights. A light and music show every 15 minutes. Meeting Santa, great merch, even got to roam and hear the lions roaring. Only thing stopping it from a 5 star rating is they closed down the hippo area without putting up any signs except by the door.

"Great zoo, especially the herpetarium. One of the most impressive viper collections I've ever seen. Signs are down in some areas like Africa due to COVID so it may be difficult to identify some of the animals in there. Only downside I'd say is that there is lots of circling around, exhibits could be better organized. Aquarium is small but very well kept. Extremely large bird collection with several aviaries and exhibits throughout the zoo. Nice crocodilian collection with Gharials and Tomistoma outdoors.

This place was great except the security guard which I caught a photo of was being weird he kept following us and asking staff if tgey were okay. And if they felt like there was danger. Our family has mask on like evetyone else. My husband is Puerto Rican and dark complected. He walked in to where the diffrently birds were kept and the security guard only walked up to him and asked that we take the stroller outside which carried my grandbabies. And we has absolutely no problem even though there were four other strollers and people with no mask. The security guard only told us not to mention there were no sign saying no strollers allowed like all the other places. Well this guard followed us thru most of the zoo. We still had a wonderful time I just wish we didnt have to experience that with the security guard.

"The San Antonio Zoo was so much fun! It is massive and there are a plethora of animals from multiple large cats, to endless amounts of reptiles to look at and learn about! The entirety of the trip was very insightful and educational.

My fiancée and I visited in the morning when it was humid and rainy, so sadly a lot of the animals (big cats, especially) were asleep. Of course that’s not the zoo’s fault, but it may be a good idea to keep in mind when you plan out a time to visit. We spent a total of four hours there, but it is definitely possible to spend even longer.

The gift shop carries a large variety of souvenirs, and there is also a restaurant in the zoo grounds. Sadly we didn’t go there as we were meeting friends elsewhere for lunch, but the next time we get the chance we would definitely check it out.

"I have always loved zoos and the San Antonio one I really enjoy. For my birthday one year, my husband and I did the beastly breakfast (additional cost to the regular admission fee). There was an all you can eat breakfast spread to enjoy. Then we each were given 3 leaves of lettuce to feed the giraffe. Love feeding them and getting photos taken.

For my birthday last year, my generous neighbor gifted my husband and I annual passes! We had gone during Zoo Lights which was fun and rode the camel for an extra fee.

For Memorial Day, I was looking forward to seeing the koalas visiting from San Diego Zoo. Before we saw them, I really enjoyed the different cats of the world. We also saw the visiting kangaroos in the petting area. For $8 per person, you can go and play with them. We saw the hippos for the first time.

"Nice zoo with a great variety of animals to see. They are committed to modernizing exhibits and are pretty regularly updating one exhibit or another. Feeding the Lori's for $2 is a lot of fun with the birds landing on you and flying all over. There is also a classic carousel and face painting for the kids in addition to a hands on kids area.

They are consistently doing special events throughout the year that bring in things like animatronic dinosaurs, a winter wonderland, and all sorts of other things.

It's not the biggest or best zoo in the country but is excellent for what it is. For comparison St Louis and San Diego are the gold standard for zoos in my opinion.

"Great zoo! Our first visit we bought membership passes after spending the day here.  Excellent for several points:
1) quality of habitats and exhibits.  It's always great to see spacious, well thought-out enclosures that recreate animals natural habitat instead of smaller cages.
2) diversity of species.  They have exhibits with animals we haven't seen at other zoo like the tree kangaroo and the okapi.  A real treat.
3) the kangaroo petting was an absolute favorite!  We hope that is stays. Seeing baby joeys was awesome.
4) a lot of engaged zoo staff to teach the kids and interact with guests made for a pleasant visit.

The few points which it didn't get 5 stars from us is that the water fountains throughout the park were all turned off which is crazy considering temperatures are in the 90's.  There are also no misting stations throughout the park.

"The entrance to the zoo had us pay electronically and get a texted or emailed receipt. I would have preferred a friendly zoo employee.

When we entered the zoo, my family and I saw two young ladies almost directly in front of us offering to take pictures. I asked the rate and then turned them down. She said, ""You can still take a picture in front of the lions."" So, my husband, grown son, and I went and posed in front of the lions to take our own selfie. I noticed one of the young ladies had her camera aimed at us. I told her we didn't want her pictures. She replied, ""Our policy is we have to take a picture if anyone takes a picture."" So my family and I walked away.

The zoo has beautiful landscaping. The Lego block displays I didn't see at first. I passed signs that said how many blocks and how many hours, but I was at the back of the zoo before I clearly saw a mallard duck and his offspring. I got so excited. That's when it dawned on me that's what the signs had meant, and I had missed the others. After that, I looked more closely to see the displays.

The zoo is beautiful, and the animals look healthy. I like the variety that you have and that you didn't have to build fake accommodations; instead you seem to have animals that can be comfortable in the heat of Texas.

The signs could be better at showing direction, because sometimes the path to follow isn't very clear. I am amazed and pleased you have helped with the protection and propagation of the Whooping Crane. We heard two of them making a beautiful sound together, but we couldn't video it quickly enough.

"The San Antonio Zoo. Not too much differs here from any other zoo, however it is a great place to walk around and take in the scenery regardless. Little kids will enjoy just as much as the adults.

The exhibits are spaced rather close together and allow anyone to see at least 2-3 animals, at one time, within the same 10 meter radius.

During the holidays, however, this place lights up in color and events, I recommend stopping by for the animals, but staying around during the holidays for the fun and festivities.

The zoo food is also good. It is a step above normal. I've been to many zoos and I would have to say this zoo's food ranks at number 4 out of 30.

"I was told it is one of finest Zoos in USA. Well I will debate on that.

Firstly the animal collection is decent but not great. They cover almost all sections of animals like birds, cats, pachyderms, apes etc.,

I believe the areas provided for animals are smaller with respect to their sizes. Apes have the smallest cages I have seen. They have impressive bird collection. They serve food at certain points of the zoo.

Staff are courteous and professional. Visit this place in the early hours where sun is not high point to see some animal activity.

"It’s been about 10 years since I have visited the zoo and although the admission price is more than I recall, they have definitely made a LOT of improvements. I didn’t even recognize the place!

The giraffe exhibit is really cool because you can now walk onto a deck that is as tall as the giraffes and you can actually feed them.  Even if you don’t pay extra to feed them, you are able to walk on the deck and see them face to face – it was AWESOME!

The Lory exhibit is also pretty cool.  You walk into this aviary and if you pay a couple of bucks, you can feed the birds – they will actually land on your shoulders and arms to eat.  One in our group didn’t have any food but 3 or 4 of the birds landed on him as soon as he walked in the gate for some reason.

Parking is the same as it always has been – kind of tough to park in the lot in Brack Park, but don’t forget there is parking under the highway on the opposite side of the zoo.

Signage could be improved – it’s hard to find your way to the exit when you are leaving.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3MHZqU09REAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Antonio+Zoo/@30.4786865,-105.8819976,6z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x865cf59ad8dd658d:0x29d4de62fd5bc2a4!8m2!3d29.4623904!4d-98.4737232!16s%2Fm%2F027j95d?hl=en",ChIJjWXd2Jr1XIYRpMJb_WLe1Ck,Zoo,4.0,San Antonio Zoo,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHgta8hLwmzWzzdA97BeOQIyY7JPv3i1h5hLOi=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"I took the day off to visit the zoo to check out the rhino exhibit I keep hearing about. I was completely disappointed. The zoo is overrun by vultures in every single corner. Poor animals are sharing their tiny little space with these animals by the dozens and waiting to grab their food. I only took a few pics because I didn't think I'd be writing a review but once I left, 24hours later it still bothered me. I will never return to the San Antonio zoo or any other zoo because when I was little, I didn't know any better as to how confined and stressed these animals look. Many zoo animals experience continuous strange behaviors because they have been kept in captivity for so long or live their entire lives alone. Many parents will continue to bring their families and keep this pattern going. There are animal shelters that provide ample space for wild animals but the zoo captivity isn't one of them.

Felt that some of the habitats or enclosures could have been better then to place them on concrete where they should all be in there own environment.  Anything that was stuck on concrete should had better layout of what they could have done.

"I used to love this zoo when I was a kid! As an adult, it was not worth the money to see empty exhibits and a ridiculous amount of vultures hanging around. Some cages were still being cleaned two hours after opening (understandable) but most were just sitting empty. We visit the zoo in SA every time we travel from Florida to visit family and this last trip was definitely the worst experience we've had at this zoo. Maybe they were having an off day but unfortunately this past trip was so full of disappointment that we've decided to stick to places like the Witte and the Doseum from now on. On a positive note, the ""newer"" sections of the zoo (Savannah/Africa Live exhibits and Tot Spot) are nice and I do always enjoy sitting in the bird house.

The exhibits are tired and cramped.  Your restrooms are not maintained….one stall was unused because lack of toilet paper…so I handed out facial tissue to women or girls in line!! Sad.

Your food and beverage prices are not high, they are ridiculously overpriced and do not reflect any bit of quality you’d expect from the price!

We donated to the butterfly conservation and got to go in the butterfly house and got up close and personal with these beautiful butterflies, the whole family enjoyed it. We got to see the hippopotamus which is a first for me and I made eye contact with one of them it was an awesome experience. Couple of suggestions if this is your first time, if you have kids bring swimming clothes they have a wonderful kids area with water and a bunch of kids activities. Second they have souvenir cups that are pricey but by the rhino area they had one for $10 and it cost just a dollar and some change to refill a definite must we refilled minimum 15 times it was extremely hot when we went.

"My family and I purchased tickets for the drive thru Zoo experience. The tickets cost $60.00 for entrance of one vehicle. The occupants included me, my two kids (1.5 YO and 4 YO) and my wife. We went on a weekday (Thursday) at around 12:00pm. The wait time to enter the zoo was 1 hour and 43 minutes. The tour of the zoo was approximately 47 minutes long. The actual experience was well thought out on part of the Zoo and their friendly staff. Restroom, snacks and gifts were available during the wait to get in, and throughout the Zoo tour. The confinement of the vehicle took away from the actual experience of being at the zoo, but still provided an excellent alternative to escape the confines of the house during trying times of the epidemic. We were able to see many animals including jaguars, alligators, flamingos, monkeys and assorted birds. We were sad to not be able to see the giraffes, elephants and the hippos as the tour did not pass their particular enclosures. However, the enclosures we did pass by, most of the animals were out and about including some bears and lions.
The overall experience was fun and memorable and the kids seemed to enjoy themselves however became restless due to the longer than expected wait time. We allowed our children to occupy the front seats with us as many other families did and the zoo staff did not seem to care as everybody I observed doing this appeared to be acting responsible. I would ultimately recommend doing this given everything that’s going on in the world, only to those however, that show patience especially given the wait time and If you have small children in the car that become restless as I do.

This was not a fun experience. The smell was bad. I know it is a zoo but wow. I mean it was smelly everywhere you went. Plus there were buzzards everywhere. I mean the eagle exhibit had one lone eagle in the middle of a group of buzzards. This many buzzards gathered in one place is unhealthy for the patrons and the animals. I kept looking for a buzzard mascot to show up at any second.  We also repeatedly seen the same animal in multiple enclosures like they didnt have anything to show so they filled extra pens with repeats.

"As you can see they think Spectacled Bears are black vultures. I jest but lots of the animals aren't even out. A good portion is under construction as I can only assume/hope, they near the end of their ""2020 Master Plan.""

Their ""Zoorassic Park"" is a lame attempt at keeping people interested or trying to distract you from all the construction/missing animals.

In my opinion Dallas, Ft Worth, Houston, and Brownsville all have better zoos. Even the small Abilene Zoo gives you more bang for your buck.

Speaking of bucks, be prepared to spend a RIDICULOUS amount. It cost approximately $35 for me and my 5 year old. But who can argue when they provide such state of the art exhibits like the gated off (and old as dirt) Wetlands that they pretend look really natural, when in reality, they just have no idea what they are doing with that area and won't cut the grass.

Btw, I love how once you buy your ticket, you then have to AGAIN show your tickets when already in the park. Yeah you read that right, once you've bought tickets, you can go to the gift shop, look at the black vultures who have squatted on the Spectacled bear's exhibits but then still have to show your ticket to get to the rest of the zoo. (Queue crappy reason from SA Zoo or Zoo member here.)

To top it all off, they've already deepsixed their Tot area for a different one. Can't have a Master Plan without revisions I guess.

TL;DR Zoo still in ""Master Plan"" construction, black vultures have taken over, lots of animals not out, admission is too high.

Do yourself a favor, go to Fiesta Texas instead. If you really want to pay a ton amd see animals just use that money and go to Sea World. At least they have a water park.

"The Zoo will always be one of the attra tions in San Antonio that the kids will enjoy but parents will dred. For starters if you are going to get food at the Zoo prepare for an hour long wait just to order your food. The main restaurant is terribly slow but the food is worth the wait. Unlike most other attractions tions they don't have same day refills, their refills are a dollar each stop. The Zoo itself is always very enjoyable even on the worst of days. The heat is even more so multiplied by the big areas of the zoo that block any wind from getting in to cool you down. Your only saving grace will be the reptile houses or other indoor attractions that will allow a quick cool down experience. Hydrate! Hydrate! Hydrate! We saw more then a few people who looked close to passing out. You will also want to call ahead and see what is closed and what is opened.

My child school came for a visit to the zoo. There is little to no animals available for children to view. Which is sad because this is the first time some of the children have come. The animal we encountered looked depressed and malnourished. The areas or spaces that the animals live in have not been updated nor cleaned period. Most spaces have no animal available to view but plenty of vultures. The zoo employees threw away their lunches and the children waited for an hour to be served. The worse experience I have ever had at this zoo. Then they served the kids peanut butter and jelly sandwichs and a bag of chips no drinks.

"It's a really nicely sized zoo. However, if you have little ones and you plan to come in the summer, make sure you take your time and have proper sun protection. My boyfriend and I were only here for about an hour and already started to overheat. Granted, they do have some air conditioned exhibits, but those get crowded because it is so hot outside. I saw lots of children throw tantrums over the heat, only satiated with ice cream. They do have dippin dots though, which was nice to me. With animals concerned, this one had a larger variety of birds than I have ever seen, with some free roaming, and some in exhibits. With the larger animals, it was so hot that some of them were either brought inside, or were sitting in the shade napping/not doing much. Can't really blame the animals for that, but I can imagine that would disappoint someone else. But what can you do, it was hot!

I love the Zoo but I don’t recommend the Zoo Lights. As you’d imagine all the animals are attempting to sleep when it gets dark. Their displays are too dark to see anything and of course they’re not keeping them awake with bright spotlights. It’s a good thing but most of the displays were completely dark. Couldn’t see anything at all. Feel like I wasted my money just to see Christmas lights and no animals. Daytime only for sure. Forget the nighttime thing. It would of been a cool date idea tho!

"I've been a member for 3 years. Its small size makes it an easy walk.

With San Francisco being a top third, and DC a middle third, this is a bottom third zoo. You will find smaller enclosures than what is typically seen. There are virtually no healthy food options, and bathrooms are such that you'd better hope you don't have to #2. Zoos in general are excused by the fact that they are supposed to teach us about nature and habitats. Yet the massive amount of plastic at the concession stands run counter to this. I'd give a pass to the plastic popcorn tub we've been using for 2 years, but plastic souvenircups, plastic souvenir straws, plastic Ziploc bags for your pickle. The latest are giant 3D plastic printers that print plastic souvenirs, at least 4 of them.

The zoo lights are quite a sight during the Christmas season. During summer, they have some excellent zoo camps for kids that my 5 and 8 yr olds really enjoyed. When they have dinosaurs there the kids love it.

The membership process is also annoying. You pay for membership, then have to return at a later date to a two person office, to print out your card which is not a quick process with 5 kids in tow. These are cheap movie ticket quality paper cards that they will charge you $5 each for if you lose them, and they will not accept photos of them from your phone or provide any digital version. The first year we were members they mailed it, and it would be nice to have the option to pay for a stamp. They have also made their entry process longer and longer each year.

"This review is for the Zoo lights and visiting the Zoo in the evening.
I think the Zoo lights were a ploy to get people to come to the zoo in the night because, you can see absolutely no animals in the dark - there are no lights and the zoo itself loses it's value prop. The kids were very disappointed as they couldnt see anything.
The zoo lights themselves were underwhelming and haphazard.

"10/10 experience!!!! Well worth the money. We spent about 2 hours here and definitely could’ve stayed longer.

Since there’s so many trees, it was shaded basically the entire zoo, which is a must in the Texas sun.

Love that this is a rescue zoo and their conservation mission. We loved reading about where each animal came from.

Also, since the animals are rescued, they weren’t hiding like they do in normal zoos. We went as soon as they open, and everyone was out and about in their exhibits.

Our favorite part was definitely feeding the goats and alpacas but it was also amazing seeing lions and cougars that close up!

"I hardly ever leave bad reviews but compared to San Antonio zoo this place was such a let down. Most of the animals are all caged up so you can’t really see them. We went on pretty chilly day and all the tropical birds were sharing one little heat lamp and you could tell they were so distressed. The animals looked pretty miserable to be honest. The only parts we enjoyed were the feeding of the farm animals which you can’t even do like at a petting zoo you have to feed them through the fence. The train and the conductor were the best part. He was super nice and pretty funny. He offered to take our pics which I appreciated. But if your not from Austin and thinking about making the trip out here…don’t. Seriously the snake farm in new branfuels was in better shape and condition than this. Drive out to San Antonio and go to a real zoo or if your looking for something more hands on drive to Johnson city to go to the exotic resort zoo, there are a lot more animals there and they look much more attended too.

I came with a double stroller and can say this zoo is not made for strollers tos a very rocky path and uphill. There wasn’t many exciting animals and the zoo was very small.

"Check your expectations. This is a rescue zoo, not a full-fledged corporate-sponsored zoo like the big ones. They have a great variety for being a small sanctuary. The paths are dirt and gravel, so wear close-toed shoes. If you or someone you are with is in a wheelchair, it may be a little rough, but we saw a few people in standard and motorized chairs. There are about 50 peacocks free roaming and in habitats. Also, it is the spring, so expect some frisky animals. The big cats can spray you if you get too close or they think you are a threat. There is a train that is about $5/rider. It is a nice little ride around the back of some of the paddocks. Every single staff member was super friendly and helpful and knowledgable. Though they don’t have concessions, they do have vending machines throughout the park. There are a few regular bathrooms that are wheelchair accessible. There are also quite a few portable toilets to the right of the entrance. The wolves, cougars, lions, and tiger were all big draws. The bears were not out when we went.

The train could be improved with running more often than once an hour on high volume days. The animals looked mostly health.

"I really enjoyed the wildlife rescue zoo. At first I was expecting a typical city zoo, but realized Austin doesn’t have a city zoo. This privately owned and funded zoo is doing a great job of providing homes for rescued animals. I enjoyed learning about the animals, but I especially loved reading about their stories. Some of the stories really tugged at your heart strings. I noticed they had some company sponsors, which is great too. They are doing a great job for being privately funded. If you need a place to sit while at the zoo I would recommend bringing a chair, because all the benches are blocked off due to COVID. They also require masks while outside even with social distancing so be prepared for the heat with a mask on. I would recommend bribing water. They do have a vending machine for water if needed.

"Came here for my friends kids birthday and it was super fabulous! I enjoy going to the zoo, this is a different type of zoo than most people are used too. The zoo is smaller than most, but it's also more laid back and casual to me. It is more of a re-homing facility for animals who have a long back story. They are definitely doing good work here! All the animals seem to be enjoying their time and they are getting love. I think it is much different than a standard zoo but it's also different in a good way. It is a non-profit and to me I think they are doing very good things for the animals and educating the children in our area. I noticed it might be difficult to get around for those who have strollers and or wheel chairs, they gravel is a little tough and there are some dips and holes, but I don't mind watching where I walk. I feel like they are spending the money on the right things. I think it's a great place to take children! The birthday party pavilion was great! It was very cool in there and plenty of space. The staff was super friendly and helpful! If I had kids I'd bring them back here often, I'd probably even take guests who are animal lovers here to visit as well!

However, they have really gone downhill. The prices are ridiculous. I had no idea you had to purchase tickets online. They made my kids and I stand under a tree while everyone got to go through. I was finally waved over and able to pay. I felt like a naughty kid being punished. The bathrooms are closed down- two nasty porta potties. There is no longer much to see.

When we circled back we went by a few more cages, I believe 3 or 4 cages with a few animals in it. We were visiting our grandchildren and next time we will just go into San Antonio.

The only fun thing to do was to feed and pet the goats and the llamas. Anything else was empty or unable to see the animal and it wasn’t even a hot day. They have a gift shop with cute merchandise and they’ve a food truck that sells hot dogs and shaved ice. They have an area with picnic tables.

"I would not call it a ""zoo"" as much as an ""animal rescue"".

I've been to several zoos and this was definitely different. The enclosures were small for the animals and many of the animals were showing signs of stress. The train ride offered is mostly through trees and shrubs, not a tour of the property, and it's not included in the admission ticket.

On the positive side, this place is small enough to visit without getting sore feet, and you can see lots of different animals close to each other. The property is also overrun by peacocks and peahens, so it was a neat experience to have them in such close proximity.

Overall, my kids found this place to be an interesting experience and liked putting coins in the donation boxes found around the preserve, but I would not come here again as I found it generally depressing to see the condition of some of the animals and enclosures.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3NXJtdWNBEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Austin+Zoo/@30.4786865,-105.8819976,6z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x865b486a700c8603:0x462555d2f98457e3!8m2!3d30.2608711!4d-97.9377719!16s%2Fm%2F02r69pd?hl=en",ChIJA4YMcGpIW4YR41eE-dJVJUY,Zoo,3.0,Austin Zoo,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkOdW2GjoV91SAz6zELuH0ok8Ma88u2iase_Yu=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"Love this place. Everytime we go we have a blast. Today, Gabby was stationed around the goats and deer (feeding area) and she was so sweet and helpful and friendly. I just loved her.

I want to praise them for running another train ride. They usually do them at the top of the hour, but there were too many people to fit on the train, so they happily ran a second ride right after the first. It really made our day. Anyway, the animals are always well taken care of. They got a new bearcat which I enjoyed learning about. They have discussions about the animals and ask the workers in the zoo know about them. Like we had to leave because it was basically a time, but someone stopped and told us about the turtle talk that was about to start. Have also let us know the train was leaving soon.

This was a really fun family trip to take the kids I was babysitting. We went in the morning as soon as it opened to beat some of the summer heat. For an adult and 2 kids (along with 1 bag of animal feed for each kid) it was $35. The zoo is well laid out and I love that they are a sanctuary for rescued animals. Make sure kiddos wear closed tied shoes (walking in dirt and rocks). Train ride was fun for kids but a lot of animals weren't out because of the heat.

I went with my sister and two kids. When we arrived the parking lot was pretty full...I was thinking it would be crowded but it wasn’t that bad. This is def a smaller zoo compared to others but doesn’t seem so small!

I love that this is pretty much a rescue zoo and on the info cards for each animal they give you information on how each animal ended up at their zoo. Some of them range from being rescued during the hurricane or being surrendered. The enclosures for each animal is amazing and the animals seem pretty happy and active.

"We were lucky enough to get a private tour thanks to a GHA/Omni Local Experience and really enjoyed meeting its Director, Patti Clark.The Zoo has the admirable mission of 'not existing at all' since without abused, injured and abandoned animals to rescue, it wouldn't need to be here.

Patti could relay every story of each animal on our tour, and although many of its inhabitants were transfers from closed pet stores and zoos, the majority were exotic pets from owners who never considered what happens when a bear, panther or alligator grows up. This zoo is the final destination for these animals where they get to live out the rest of their days without transfer.

While there are no giraffes, polar bears or theme park rides, there's an enthusiastic and friendly staff caring for several hundred animals that otherwise most likely would have been euthanized. This non-profit is continuously building new enclosures and facilities and hosts daily programs and talks for kids and adults alike, in its effort to house animals from the 40-50 calls they get every month.

Austin Zoo is not a flashy place and doesn't have multi-million dollar enclosures and exhibits. You can see your entrance fee and donations in action, and the focus is on providing the best possible support for rescued animals. I'd strongly recommend visiting - kids will always love a trip to the zoo - but for adults the ethical mission is the real draw.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNna2ZTdHRnRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Austin+Zoo/@30.4786865,-105.8819976,6z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x865b486a700c8603:0x462555d2f98457e3!8m2!3d30.2608711!4d-97.9377719!16s%2Fm%2F02r69pd?hl=en",ChIJA4YMcGpIW4YR41eE-dJVJUY,Zoo,5.0,Austin Zoo,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTwx__Bx6W2PekYDpOdNqooDLs1TCtAiLl3rRG=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"DON’T GO IF YOUR CHILD WON’T WEAR A MASK!

My friend and I and our four children, ages 4,3,2 and 7 months visited the Austin Zoo earlier this week.
The good: It is so classic Austin. Nestled on a hillside on the outskirts of town amidst lots of cedar trees, there were no paved walkways. I loved it. You can get through it in about an hour and feel like you didn’t miss much, which is great with small children. They have a fun interactive petting zoo and peacocks roaming around all over. Love it!
The not-so-good: I confess most of this is due to my comparison experience with the zoo in my city- South Bend, IN (home of Mayor Pete Buttegieg). Our zoo is about comparable in size and number and type of animals. We also have no elephants, but we do have rhinos and will be getting giraffes soon. The surprising part of this is that South Bend is about a tenth of the size of Austin. I think maybe the Austin Zoo wants only rescue animals, and there aren’t rescue elephants...I don’t know. There are also a lot more cages at the Austin Zoo whereas South Bend has created much more natural habitats for most of their animals.
By far the biggest, most frustrating difference, however, was the mask policy. In the South Bend Zoo, and most places, you are only required to wear masks inside or if you can’t social distance. (FYI I am VERY pro-mask, but within reason). This even includes the animal feeding area in the South Bend Zoo. In Austin everyone, including small children 2 and over, are required to wear masks even outdoors (which is the entire zoo basically) unless you are eating. On a windy day from 20 feet away the chances of passing on Covid are so low even the CDC wouldn’t require this. It seems so unlikely Covid could be passed on to people or animals in that scenario. The Austin Zoo seemed possibly more concerned about their animals catching Covid than people, and I haven’t read about animals becoming seriously ill with Covid.
Wearing masks for adults I do not believe is much to ask, but for my friend’s 4 year old, she was very very upset, and refused to put one on. Children are not used to having to wear masks outdoors. Luckily they allowed us to stay as long as we promised to distance from the animals, but we were pretty worried we were going to be kicked out having seen almost none of the zoo—and tickets are NOT CHEAP. You even have to pay for 2 year olds. It goes without saying we didn’t do the petting zoo.
So bottom line-great zoo, but don’t go if you think your child will refuse to wear a mask.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMUlXOGt3RRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Austin+Zoo/@30.4786865,-105.8819976,6z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x865b486a700c8603:0x462555d2f98457e3!8m2!3d30.2608711!4d-97.9377719!16s%2Fm%2F02r69pd?hl=en",ChIJA4YMcGpIW4YR41eE-dJVJUY,Zoo,3.0,Austin Zoo,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlhvZMW2YhH-oz9EY2r4rPY-NM-CCGgDPjkjzN=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

There’s a park across from here so you park there and walk. Perfect for people with little ones. The woman at the window could of been more friendly!

"Great little zoo with well kept animals. The zoo is really well kept and they have a really good variety of animals. Their cages were clean and they all seemed happy and well-fed. The whole zoo isn't very big but definitely worth the price. The customer service is what needs a little work. Some of the employees were great and very friendly while others seemed to be bothered by questions. I also didn't like that there was only one very small restroom in the very beginning. But, overall a great ace to visit for a few hours. Also, as everyone has noted the free castle playground in the front is a major plus.

"Very nice selection with a few issues: Many of the tanks are mislabeled; the fish are a different species or don't have a label at all. The short woman with the bangs is very rushed and careless when handling fish. She seems to be annoyed with questions and customers overall. All of the other employees, however, are friendly and care about where/how your fish will be living.

Aisles are a bit narrow, and I doubt they're ADA compliant. Salt water tanks are on the second floor, which is only accessible via stairs. Pond area is nice. The parking can be tricky, but it's mostly shaded.

"At best, I'm a novice at the aquarium hobby. I've been setting up an aquarium and navigating all the intricacies that comes with setting up a new aquarium. In doing so, a social media aquarium hobby group recommended the Austin Aqua Dome as a solid, local hub for hobbyists. During my visit, I was greeted and invited to ask any questions I might have.

The building calls back to the ""Keep Austin Weird"" idea in both supporting a local business *and* being a wonderfully unique shopping experience in offering an infinite collection of aquarium related materiel to purchase- from fresh water to salt/marine, from ponds, to desktop bowls and extravagant custom aquariums. My overall experience was akin to me being a kid going on a great field trip like a previous visitor mentioned in their review.

Though I am still waiting to introduce fish to my aquarium, I was able to have questions answered about different live plants suitable to my experience and want for the type of fish community I'll eventually be keeping. I was introduced to a myriad of different plant varieties and they had a wonderfully diverse set of options to choose from. I ended up purchasing 5 plants of two different kinds and a wonderful piece of prepared driftwood for my setup. I also bought a plant solution to introduce and maintain for my water that promotes growth. Finally, because I look to continue my business relationship with Austin Aqua Dome, I purchased a one year membership that will likely pay for itself as my odyssey into this passtime grows. High fives all around and I can't wait to go back again and, if my S.O. doesn't kill me, maybe start a 2nd aquarium in the near future!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNnZEbU5nEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Austin+Aqua-Dome/@30.229189,-97.7858588,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x8644b4caed938353:0xd15c7b293e7a71b1?hl=en",ChIJU4OT7cq0RIYRsXF6Pil7XNE,Tropical fish store,5.0,Austin Aqua-Dome,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzvTCZ1dR9jzbJqUaP3jWK9k5QhwuCKQhrCG9j=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"Our experience here was awesome! My boyfriend and I did 'The Lost Ship' room. It was a Wednesday 7pm booking, so just the two of us took on the challenge without anyone else booking in. And we escaped with 90 seconds to spare!! Our guide, Captain Charles, did a fantastic job introducing the room to us with this whole back story to set us up. If you pay close attention, there are clues in everything he's saying as well.

The room itself was the best part. It was actually several rooms all joined together and from the lobby you had to figure out how to even enter the main room in the first place—super cool! I had never seen anything like that before. The puzzles were also really well thought out and interesting, using logic and problem solving (not at all abstract or random). Of all the escape rooms I have done, I would say that this has been the best experience I have had because of the attention to detail in the room, the quality of the puzzles, and the experience of being able to solve it with just the two of us.

The room is actually designed for at least 6 people, because it would have been helpful for others to take on and simultaneously solve riddles in the room. I'm pretty amazed we were able to do it with just 2 (but it was mostly because we had a few timely hints... big ones, lol). Awesome experience, highly recommend!!!

P.S. - This location has only this room (Pirate's Booty 2 - The Lost Ship), and the other rooms are in their downtown location.

"Typically I am quite skeptical about these corporate run places or attractions like this. Especially when they're located in a mall or something of that fashion. In my opinion they tend to be more of a gimmick than an actual fun and educational experience.
That being said, you should also know that if you're expecting something like one of those very large public aquariums that everyone raves about, this very much isn't that in any way shape or form (and that's okay). It is however much larger than what you might be anticipating if you're basing things on how the outside of the building looks.

I say all of that, to say this. Even though this place isn't of the caliber of many major city aquariums, it does have to some great qualities for what it is. I wound up here because my Fiancé and I decided it would be a good weekend adventure for the kids, and as it turned out, we were right.

One of the major perks right off the bat is the fact that they often are only taking guests that buy tickets in advance (at least this was the case while we were there), meaning it is much less busy than it would be if they were letting everyone walk up and buy tickets. I feel that this really made for a less congested and more personal experience with the kids.

I don't know exactly what I was expecting for the price of a ticket here, but I do feel like it was absolutely worth it, not only for the kids, but for the adults as well. There were certain periods throughout the experience that I think I was probably more excited to see a certain animal than my ten year old son was. The way this place is set up is basically you're in an undersea maze where you continue on, learning about and seeing all sorts of creatures, eventually ending up at the end (a.k.a the gift shop). There are also parts where you're able to interact and be hands on with certain sea creatures, and that was pretty entertaining as well.

There are not only quite a few creatures (both salt and freshwater) to take a gander at but also several activities for the kids to take part in during the whole experience. This place also makes it incredibly easy to be able to see everything no matter how big or small you are (you'll see what I mean when you walk through). You might even get the opportunity to see several of the creatures eat, which can be quite fascinating. Specifically the Stingrays, I mean have you ever seen a Stingray eat? Probably not, and you totally have the ability to here.

When all is said and done, should this act as a replacement for those gigantic public aquariums that many cities have? Absolutely not, but oftentimes not everyone has access to those places or those specific aquariums, and this would probably be the next best thing in my opinion.
The staff here is also friendly, professional, and seemingly quite knowledgeable about the sea creatures they keep, which was refreshing to see.
I truly believe that if you can separate the fact that you're not going to get the full ""aquarium"" experience that you might get at those other very well known gigantic aquariums, then you can truly have a great time here, especially if you bring the kids.

"Great location to have an aquarium! The Great Lakes Crossing Outlets are still thriving, unlike so many other malls in the Midwest. Sealife Aquarium is right next to Rainforest Cafe, which is fitting.

The exhibits are nice, the ambient music is soothing, and the lighting really makes the exhibits and fish GLOW. This is a small aquarium, but they managed to put A LOT to see and enjoy into it.

There is a small gift shop, places to sit, interactive exhibits, and decent-sized and adequately cleaned bathrooms.

There isn’t a food area, but with Rainforest Cafe and the food court, it’s not necessary.

The price of admission was decent. Due to Covid, it’s necessary to schedule your time slot. I appreciated the ability to choose a time, as we went on a Thursday at 11:00am, so we could take our time and not be “crowded out”.

You can also pay $3 more to get a behind the scenes tour of how this place runs and takes care of the fish. Fun for the whole family. It's pretty expensive though, so I would suggest buying your tickets online because you save about $5 per person. Certain ages get in free. It's worth the trip if you don't live nearby.

"SEA LIFE Michigan Aquarium is a great place to go.  The entry fee is a little high but in line with other aquariums around the country.  If they brought it down a little I believe they would see even more traffic and serve a greater part of the community.

The exhibits are kept neat and clean on the outside.  There were just two tanks they seemed to be having problems with but it was obvious they were working on it.  The staff was welcoming and engaged.  We had a slight difficulty at exit getting our ‘free photo’ when we were directed to go back into the line to get it.  That was worked out satisfactorily.

They have apparently been actively engaged in breeding and helping wounded wildlife but I did not see anything specific about that in the exhibits other than some numbers posted at entry.

They have a wide variety of sea life on display and they all appeared in good health.  Most of the displays had plastic plants in them.  It would be nice to see more natural environments for the creatures and to examine them.

The viewing tunnel was very crowded.  There was no docent there and several patrons took the opportunity to rest and enjoy the tunnel while a single line file of other patrons had to navigate through along with carriages and mall baggage they might have with them.

"My family and I enjoyed the aquarium. There are a lot of great sea life to enjoy and some games to play. Older children would probably not enjoy this as much as the younger ones. Still a great experience and place to educate on all things water life.
As a person who has enjoyed many aquariums throughout the states, this one is very small when doing price comparison. If you use the coupons and discounts available (AAA, buy legoland get aquarium, or child free coupons) it is worth it. However the price without such is not worth it.
Example: (walk up pricing)
TN adults are $35 & child (3-12) $22
MI adults are $24 & child (3-12) $19
TN -We spent 4 hours exploring 2 HUGE buildings Sea & Fresh water life(could have explored longer too). Played several free games. Touched turtles.
MI- 1 hour exploring played 2 free games, and touched turtles.
Is it worth visiting? Yes
Is it fun? Yes

"The Aquarium was lovely. My Daughter loved it. However, she was SO EXCITED to see Peppa. I didn't realize she was going to be there for only 15 minutes, & at the End of the attraction.  They made an announcement stating the section she was in (but we had no idea where that was. As we were at the begining) Anyway, I rushed my Daughter through in search for Peppa. We made it to the end by 12:12. Stood there, wondering where she was. At 12:14 I took a pic of her not there, & screeshoted the time on my phone. Another Mother with her toddler was also upset. She told me that was the whole reason they came. I think it's pretty crummy they didn't even do it for the full 15 minutes. Especially being that 15 minutes is not very long at all. With that being said. Again, the Aquarium was fun, but hearing my kid bring up that she didn't get to meet Peppa like promised the rest of the day stunk. ☹️

"Sea Life Aquarium is a great place to visit. It does seam a little on the small side; However, there are educational talks that take place several times a day. There are also feedings for animals such as the green sea turtles Benson and Carr. There are also feedings for the stingrays, green eel and bamboo sharks. If that is not enough, Sea Life also offers behind the scenes passes for only a few dollars a person. The passes take you behind the scenes where all of the magic and work goes into running an aquarium. The tour includes seeing where the animal’s food is prepared, going to the life support system for the aquarium, the quarantine area as well as the lab where water testing takes place. There are a few animals not on display that are back there too, that only behind the scenes pass holder get to see. Sea Life Aquarium usually also has several events throughout the year. Usually offering bonus things for the kiddos. There are also promotions for first responders and teachers to get in free certain times of the year. As well as other offers. Sea Life is owned by Merlin Entertainments, last time I was there they offered deals for Lego Land, that Merlin Entertainments also owns.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVbnBQTU1nEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/SEA+LIFE+Michigan+Aquarium/@42.7036708,-83.4407003,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x882495b22d0ac751:0xe518db4be74a1e42!8m2!3d42.7036708!4d-83.2965047!16s%2Fg%2F11c3khpvgx?hl=en",ChIJUccKLbKVJIgRQh5K50vbGOU,Aquarium,5.0,SEA LIFE Michigan Aquarium,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdDDKSDlu8flmYNcWQ90rFR34YSJnyAX1-NOK4=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

It was perfect for my 2 year olds birthday present but we went on a Saturday so her dad could be present and it was so over crowded it was hard for her to enjoy it as much as she would have had it been less crowded. They had a tide pool for the kids to touch sea creatures which was cool. My cousin brought her 2 year old on a Tuesday around noon and barely anyone there and she said I'd probably find it much more enjoyable with baby girl had we gone then so well have to do it like that next time because there's sO much to see you could easily enjoy going a second time as well as your kiddo if they love animals like mine does. It was awesome 5 stars aside from over crowding maybe they could have more control over the times and let less people in at a time and have legit ticket times or stone more organization in that way to make it easier first you to see everything.😃(bad pics sorry was taking videos and it won't let me post videos 😔),ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzaUphWUVBEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/SEA+LIFE+Michigan+Aquarium/@42.7036708,-83.4407003,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x882495b22d0ac751:0xe518db4be74a1e42!8m2!3d42.7036708!4d-83.2965047!16s%2Fg%2F11c3khpvgx?hl=en",ChIJUccKLbKVJIgRQh5K50vbGOU,Aquarium,4.0,SEA LIFE Michigan Aquarium,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQ_z6NVVlmy0XUhfj5Zg7izrHY8mvaPH8S7PjP=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

It was nice. Planning on going to the zoo this day but it was raining. So we decided to go th great lakes crossing. This place is expensive. $95. To get in three adults one child and one under 2.

"Not sure why people complain about this place. We were inside for a little over an hour. We had enough time to see everything and it wasn't too crowded. The staff are extremely friendly and good with kids and happy to answer any questions.

We got a Groupon and it was about $26 for an adult and 1 kid, total. They also have various coupons online and you can combine prices with Legoland for a larger discount. We went the cheap route and just went to Sea Life.

We bought the $5 Mission Pack and my nephew (7 yo) was super excited to find all of the stamps and get his little badge of completion. They even have a little play area (think McDonald's play area size) at the end of the tour, in addition to various simple games throughout the whole place.

"We have gone to SeaLife several times, and each experience has been different. If you're able to go on a weekday, it is less busy, and more enjoyable if you like to stop and read about various things or even talk to an employee about different species. Weekends are okay, but more crowded, and I think the employees are less able to talk. Anyway, we have done the ""behind the scenes"" tour which was cool, it wasn't the most exciting thing, but maybe for someone considering marine biology it would be. The critters here are all well cared for, and each visit, I have noticed how consistent they are with keeping things clean. If you are in the area, I would definitely stop! It is a little expensive, but it's cheaper than a trip to Chicago and I cannot think of another aquarium that is close.

We had a fantastic time visiting the mermaids at Sea Life Aquarium. It was a great event with a show and meet and greet and handled mich better at this location than last year's at the location in Minnesotta. They have a great variety of tanks and fish including a touch pool and tunnels under tanks for little ones to explore. The kids had a fun time completing their ranger adventure packs and getting a special reward!

"Today was our first time visiting Sea Life Aquarium! We decided to make a day trip out to Great Lakes Crossing Mall and do Legoland followed by Sea Life Aquarium. We had researched beforehand and knew the Legoland visit would eat up about 3-4 hours or more and the aquarium visit would eat up about 90 minutes or so. We bought a combo ticket through Legoland that included a visit to Legoland that day and a visit to Sea Life Aquarium either the same day or up to 30 days after the date of purchase. I have seen some reviews talk about the price of Sea Life being rather expensive. I would have to agree. It definitely didn't end up being a cheap day for us.

I've also seen reviews about the age of kids making a difference. I would totally agree with this. My mother and I enjoyed ourselves as adults visiting the aquarium and we brought my 6 year old son and 3 year old daughter, who both had a ton of fun. However, if we had brought my 11, 12, or 15 year olds with us, I'm not sure they would've had nearly as much fun. There are a few kids activities throughout the aquarium, which includes coloring with crayons, coloring and naming a virtual fish, which then starts swimming around in a virtual fish tank, and an activity book ($5 extra per book) where kids can perform tasks and add embossed stamps at the different stamp stations throughout the aquarium.

Overall it was fun and enjoyable. I'm not sure I'd ever go back just for Sea Life Aquarium. We'd definitely do the combo tickets again.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRNHRlTDBBRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/SEA+LIFE+Michigan+Aquarium/@42.7036708,-83.4407003,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x882495b22d0ac751:0xe518db4be74a1e42!8m2!3d42.7036708!4d-83.2965047!16s%2Fg%2F11c3khpvgx?hl=en",ChIJUccKLbKVJIgRQh5K50vbGOU,Aquarium,4.0,SEA LIFE Michigan Aquarium,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM41HmIMzbbNhngKmQw-ZnbJ6nG4Z0DoA2ouUNi=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"Overall, this is a really nice aquarium. The primary wow factor is realizing it's virtually all contained in one large atrium with a spiral walkway up the center and an open-air penguin exhibit across the entire bottom of the room. I love penguins, so being able to see them up close and from slightly above with no glass between us was really fascinating. I also loved the seal and sea lion exhibits being outside (yet covered). It adds a more natural feel to the area, which I'm sure the animals enjoy.

I think my only complaint would be that it seems a little small for the ticket price, especially compared to other aquariums across the country. If you purchase a combo pass with other attractions, I'm sure it's a better value. However, all that being said, I was impressed with the number of displays they were able to fit into the space. They made good use of the building's height.

A fantastic aquarium and easily walkable from our hotel.  We came here in the afternoon after doing a Duck Tour in the morning.  We have been several times and my husband and I agree that the penguin exhibit at the entrance is the most memorable aquarium entrance we both remember.  It is worth walking the four floors up and then following the huge tank down the ramp in the middle of the museum.

"We went on a Wednesday and it was pretty busy but, decent room to move around. The concept of the enormous single tank with a wrap around spiral is pretty cool.

Some cool infographics around, geared more towards conservation rather than just stats. Nice to see the creatures with large areas of space to live.

"As a fan of the film Next Stop Wonderland, the New England Aquarium was a must-see during my visit to Boston, and it did not disappoint!  The aquarium offers a AAA discount and a university discount. Upon entering, I turned to the left to the sting ray petting experience and shark exhibit.  This was the first of multiple stops where aquarium staff were on hand to share information and answer questions, which was great! I appreciated the washing station, too. The shark exhibit was interactive and engaging.  I could go on about the multiple exhibits and aquariums in the main building, but the jewel of this Aquarium is the enormous, multi-story tank featuring sea turtles, schools of fish, and the scuba divers feeding them.  I suggest calling ahead to find out when the feeding time will be so that you don’t miss it! See if you can find the small Puffer fish in that large tank; it’s not easy, but worth seeing that friendly little face! 😊 if you turn to the right as you enter the main space, you will find a flashlight attached to the railing that allows you to play with the penguins!

Really enjoyed this aquarium! I've been to many different aquariums; New England stood out because they created many different environments that were truly natural to the species they were trying to preserve.

"Cute aquarium. I’ll lay out the pros and cons to help anyone visiting Boston for a few days decide whether coming here is worth it or not.

Cons:
I wasn’t a fan of layout of the building itself and the flow between exhibits was kind of awkward. Also, the touch tanks (ie where the sharks and rays are) are right at the entrance and easy to pass by when you enter. If you go into the gift shop before seeing that area you won’t be able to come back in without showing your ticket again which is kind of annoying.

The ticket price was also kind of expensive for the size of the aquarium ($34) considering there isn’t that much to see and you’ll probably spend 1.5-2h there at most. The gift shop has only a few items with the cute logo on it and the rest have tacky clip art on them that you wouldn’t even be able to tell came from this specific aquarium. They should at least put Boston on there or something.

Pros:
Some of the habitats are so creatively curated, from the shape of the glass to the way they planted the vegetation, it’s all very pleasing to the eye. If you go in the morning you can see the animals being fed which is extra entertaining. They all seem happy especially the turtles who you can see love to be handled by the marine biologists. All staff is friendly and open to answering questions. If you have small kids and came with a stroller they have elevators and a ramp that goes all the way around the building so you can walk around easily without missing anything.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OXNTRU9REAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/New+England+Aquarium/@43.8628939,-75.5957617,6z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e3707d60bfd085:0xdda63d8ad6157d49!8m2!3d42.3592478!4d-71.0491475!16zL20vMDUyamZo?hl=en",ChIJhdC_YH1w44kRSX0V1oo9pt0,Aquarium,4.0,New England Aquarium,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1ShvWh47P907k6zdCq-NCKXNbH7h7UQkQzseo=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"I enjoyed my time here but just didn’t think this aquarium was worth the money. I was hoping there would be more exhibits and diversity of wildlife. Maybe it’s different in the summer but I would’ve loved to see a dolphin, sea lion or otter show.

"4/5 stars because I wasn't super impressed with the overall offerings of live species.
I do love the design of the aquarium and the overall feel when you walk in to the penguin exhibit.

I've been to some great aquariums and I missed the sharks and the sea otters and in Oregon they even had an orca-which happened to be in the movie, Free Willy. Although that was years ago they still have a fantastic exhibit with many more species.

I don't want to be too harsh of a critic, but I was a bit underwhelmed.

I did enjoy the penguin exhibit, the seals and the big sea turtles.

The feel tank had stingrays alone. It was fine, but many feel tanks usually have starfish and other sea urchins. As well as someone commentating.

It was pretty busy and hard to get good pictures, since everybody else is trying to do the same thing.

"Great aquarium. Our kids loved it. What sucked was the amount of people, crammed in, pushing you out of the way and tripping over strollers that are slammed into your legs. They said tickets were timed and entry was limited, due to covid19 and to avoid overcrowding, but it was definitely over-crowded.

The parents allowing their children to beat on the glass (and acting like it was cute behavior) was ridiculous. I know the aquarium cannot control how people behave, but there were no staff in the areas to correct that behavior (even though it is the parents job!!)

The seal tank out front of the aquarium entrance was a great idea! It made our kids even more excited to see the inside.

The stingray touch tank was so much fun! My youngest was nervous at first but was so glad he finally touched one. They had so much personality too!

It was cool seeing the harbor seals outside of the aquarium as we were getting our tickets. Nice African penguin reef. And a 4 story tank that had a fossilized turtle it looked like when we got to the top of the tank. There's a picture of it. He'd been there a long time it looked like.

"Great getaway for the weekend!
The tix is $32 for adults, $30 for college students only.
The interactive shark tank was one of the best features of this aquarium, you get to touch the sharks softly while they swim by.
The seals were also very eye catching and you will be able to watch them interact and play with the trainers
There are also two different kinds of penguins at the entrance of the aquarium

The aquarium isn’t too big, but you can spend around 2 hours in there.

"The grandkids saw some sea lions swimming in a tank before we even went in and it got them excited and interested but that’s the only free thing you’ll get all day. Let’s start with parking in the garage next door they own. $46 to park for 3 hours. Ticket prices are outrageous especially for kids. And Senior discount, what a joke; $2 off per ticket. That won’t even by me a half gallon kg gas. There are some nice features to the facility. The central attraction is a large tank in the middle with penguins on the lower level and then all the fish and turtles in the tank. Tip: take the elevator to the top floor (4th) and walk “down” the spiral walkway that wraps around the tank. It’s less crowded and easier than walking up the ramp especially with old ones and the little ones. Another great area is the Stingray tank. You can put your hands in the water and stroke the rays as they glide by under water. The little ones loved this. There is a shark exhibit on the floor below this area but real sharks are limited to some small species and baby sharks. My 5 year old granddaughter began singing; you guessed it: “ Baby Shark do do da do, baby shark____”
Besides the cost of parking and entrance fees there are other costs that are high. Just like Disney World you can’t exit unless you go through the Gift Shop. The first items thrust into your face are the overpriced stuffed fish, sharks, etc. While my grandkids are very good about excepting No for an answer I fully understand that for some children it’s hard and I find this set up very unfair to families. The cafeteria is pretty small and is very limited. It is self serve, precooked burgers, hot dogs, fries, etc. No GF options in real food, just a GF cookie. Prices are what you would expect for a facility that has you trapped.
Another criticism of the entire facility is a lack of continuity and sine age and directions. Because everyone is afraid to hand out printed brochures anymore ( sustainably) you have no idea what is available in the aquarium and how to find it. Employees are limited so there are no guides or personnel stationed strategically throughout to assist you. Overall it was an ok experience but a tough nut to swallow if you’re on a tight budget. If you find yourself in the mid Cape area with little ones, do yourself a favor and take them to Cape Cod Museum of Natural History (Brewster). While it’s not an Aquarium it’s similar in being a museum for natural wonders. It’s way more hands on, interesting and informative. There are plenty of employees to help you, you get a map with a scavenger hunt on it for the little ones. The price of admission is reasonable and there is free parking.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNEstTTdRRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/New+England+Aquarium/@43.8628939,-75.5957617,6z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e3707d60bfd085:0xdda63d8ad6157d49!8m2!3d42.3592478!4d-71.0491475!16zL20vMDUyamZo?hl=en",ChIJhdC_YH1w44kRSX0V1oo9pt0,Aquarium,3.0,New England Aquarium,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZoccY5X5vC85G3eA2dRSXkLeN3_qL1AXD1sjK=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"$34 dollars a person to basically walk up a 3 story sea spiral.. really underwhelming and disappointing. Takes about 35 minutes to walk through— It’s mobbed on the weekends and is claustrophobic being stuck in the spiral with 1,000 people. Lacking joy; really no spaces / exhibits for self exploration as you just follow the crowd up and then back down. If your aquarium is just going to be 12 penguins and 4 sea lions, it better be the the best conditions available for these critters to be highlighted and celebrated.

"I'm only sharing one photo, albeit a unique one for this review because I feel this an aquarium to be experienced. The only other aquarium I'm fairly familiar with is the Georgia State Aquarium which I've been to a few times.

What I like about the New England Aquarium is:
* No annoying ""Brought to you by Home Depot!"" signs every 15 feet
* The ability to be a little bit closer to some frens, like the Sea Lions and Penguins. You also get to see them get fed, which is pretty cool 😮
* The neat, large, vertical tank in the center of the Aquarium -- this is pretty cool!
* Displays that are slightly more unique than other Aquariums
* Knowledgeable staff
* Being able to pet a sting-ray!!!!!!! 🤯

The only thing that makes me sad is, it felt a little small with the amount of people. This may have been due to showing up on a Friday and going with a party of my peers. You learn some pretty cool facts about some of the frens they have and how old they are in the Aquarium.

I absolutely love aquariums! I love having fish around me and seeing different and unique sea creatures. When you enter the aquarium you have a giant pool with tons of penguins.

The large tank in the middle have lots of different species of fish and some sea turtles.

"Absolutely beautiful and incredible experience!!! 🤯😍 I love how it is all handicap accessible, although I am not handicapped, my mother in law has a boot on her foot, so it was a great experience because of the accessibility. The penguin exhibit is absolutely amazing and just wonderful to sit and listen to the noise and when they would fight. I'm someone that is incredibly against any kind of zoo, or SeaWorld type of places but I did read up on this place and found that they do some sanctuary work and conservation as well so I agreed to go here and let me tell you ... When you walk up through the levels ... Such beauty such amazing fantastic views, the fish, the life that lives within this water was absolutely amazing and so very beautiful. Some things, fishes and other aquatic life that I have never seen and I loved it but my daughter just absolutely loved it and wanted a penguin. Also, the larger sea turtle in the giant cylinder aquarium, is 95 years old and when my mother in law was a child, that very same turtle was just a young little baby and than when my husband was a young child, this same turtle was mid aged and so big and beautiful. They have pictures from their times with this same turtle. Just a wonderful place, very informative, sea lions to watch them swim and play around outside as you waited was wonderful. Also, while we waited we got to walk around the giant walkway that surrounds the aquarium and also has the boats for people that want to go whale watching or just a boat ride. There's also the duck tour boats where they go from moving vehicle to a boat. It was fun to see the very old and antique ship too and to take pictures with my family on the ocean. Just beautiful and wonderful experience altogether. The gift shop has some pretty amazing items to buy!

"Let’s start by saying the aquarium is small and get that out-of-the-way now.

The aquarium is conveniently located near many other activities and was a quick and easy subway ride from where we stayed. People were required to wear a mask indoors and the aquarium was kept clean with hand sanitizing stations everywhere.

"We went to the aquarium yesterday.
We used our city pass, and I'm glad we didn't pay out of pocket because it wouldn't have been worth the money IMO.
The sea lions were really cool, the touch tank with the sting rays was also awesome, and we loved looking at the fish and penguins.
However, my kids and I got bored quickly. It was cramped and uncomfortable to get around.
We skipped a lot of the fish tanks along the walls because we could never actually get in and close enough to see anything because there were loads of people at each one. If you did so happen to get to one that wasn't loaded with people, you would quickly get cornered in. We were all so excited to go here, and it was really just a disappointment. We originally came here for the whale watch, but that got canceled unfortunately.
It was really cool seeing all the different animals up close, well the ones we could get close enough to, but if you're coming here expecting something amazing, I feel like you'd be let down. I hate that I'm giving this place a lower rating than I wanted to, but I feel I need to be honest. It wasn't horrible here, there just wasn't much to see or do.

Great place to visit with kids or just adults! They have so many things to see. The large tank spans all 4 floors and as you go down your perspective changes and you get to see how the layers of a coral reef create different ecosystems (before you leave go back up to the top to see how things changed just while you were there). I suggest starting at the top and working your way down. No two visits are the same as you never know what you'll see or what the animals are doing.

I am not saying it wasn't a nice aquarium, but it didn't seem to live up the a number 1 ranking.  The tickets were $37 per person which isn't bad knowing that it is going to help conservation but then you have to add $40 to park in Boston.

"We had an amazing time at the New England aquarium! They were a bit overly cautious about the masks but I guess safety comes first. I was a little disappointed that the shark exhibit was down. I was also disappointed that the stingray touch was down. I had to have a time slot before being allowed to enter. Thought that meant maybe there would be more social distancing but as it turns out, there were still hundreds of people there so I'm not sure why they were so strict on the time that we had to be there or we couldn't come in nor could we get our tickets refunded. To me that sounded like we were going to be alone in an exhibit by ourself or something but that is definitely not the case. They had a great variety of fish. I loved watching the sea lions!

"How can you not visit the Aquarium when in Boston? This place is huge and worth the entrance fee, even if you can only swing through for a short time! The exhibits are great and show a variety of aquatic life. The larger ones like the penguin and the main giant tank can take a long time to absorb and see everything swimming about. That can become a challenge if the place is crowded since all the benches are taken. It certainly prevents a relaxing absorption of the wonders of nature but I will definitely sacrifice that so that more can enjoy it!

"The New England Aquarium is located in Downtown Boston, Massachusetts right on the pier. They have seal, penguin, jellyfish, sea turtles, shark exhibits and more! This is a rather small aquarium compared to other aquariums we've been to but the size from the outside makes it look massive. We went online to book our tickets and they some available from 4-5PM. We booked the 4:20pm times as we weren't going to make it by 4. As we arrived we thought there was going to be on-site parking but instead parked at the garage right next to the aquarium thinking they owned it. The prices for this parking garage are absolutely outrageous. $20+ dollar for parking longer than 30 minutes and $40 for parking 80 minutes or longer. When we got to the ticket booth we asked if parking was included with our tickets and we were informed that the parking deck was a privately owned deck and they weren't able to validate it for us unless we were doing whale watching (which was an extra $50+ per person) or we were members. We are just traveling through so we were not members. Upon checking out the exhibits, we noticed that sting ray touching was off limits and interactive displays were closed and turned off. These are things that I pay for when we book a ticket here so the tickets should have been discounted or there should have been a notice on the website stating this before buying. We spent our time reading everything to be informed and learn about the aquarium and after reaching the second level we heard someone over the intercom say that the aquarium was closing in 30 minutes. We had only been there for a little over an hour and haven't even seen the rest of the 3 floors. We rushed to see everything we could and got to the fourth floor 3 minutes before we were told they were closing in 12 minutes and we had to go back to the main floor. The staff informed us we had to go back down and was following very close behind us as if they were security escorting us off the premises or something. It felt very uncomfortable. We made our way down to the gift shop and left 2 minutes before 6 when they closed.

I left 2 stars because I feel as though they shouldn't have had tickets to be sold past 4pm because if you really want to see and read everything and take it all in, it takes at least 2 hours or more to do so without feeling rushed. It was also sad to see the interactive parts of the aquarium blocked off even though hand sanitizer was everywhere and they don't enforce mask wearing for vaccinated people so I'm not really sure why it's still closed. And with our parking not being validated we eneded up paying $40 for 2 hours of parking because we didn't know otherwise, and $64 for an aquarium experience that had all their interactive experiences closed but still wanted full price admissions. For a total of $104 for a 2 hour experience that felt rushed and incomplete, this felt like a rip off and we felt totally sad after leaving.

I'm leaving this review so hopefully others can be informed and don't make the same mistakes we did. Would not recommend unless fully open to enjoy everything and come the latest by 3pm if you really want to get everything this aquarium has to offer.

"For the last three years, I've been on the Whale Watchers boat ride, yet I've never actually been inside the Aquarium.

Luckily, this year, I decided to skip the 3 to 4 hour-long ride that was about $60 per person, and invested in an All-Inclusive Go City Boston pass.

The Aquarium was my first stop on my itinerary, and I was happy to have seen it. The entire Aquarium follows a spiral-like structure, which is lovely, as you literally cannot miss anything. Unfortunately, due to COVID, two of the exhibitions were closed: the sharks and the meant-for-kids section.

Greeted by penguins, then viewing animals from the Amazon, to creatures of the sea, every floor was wonderful. The area is wheelchair accessible for each floor, and the bathrooms are clean (there is only 1 on the first floor).

You will most likely take photos of the gigantic and old Myrtle the Turtle, which has somewhat become a Boston mascot :D.

And when you are about to exit, do not miss the seals, as the door is almost unnoticeable after viewing the loud Rockhopper penguins again.

Do note, once you enter the gift shop, you are unallowed to revisit the Aquarium again.

I would say that if you plan on coming here, do plan to stay for at most 2.5 hours. I highly recommend it, and if you are using a Go Boston pass, as you exit, you could go to your next attraction on a boat on the wharf.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDajlhV1ZnEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/New+England+Aquarium/@43.8628939,-75.5957617,6z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e3707d60bfd085:0xdda63d8ad6157d49!8m2!3d42.3592478!4d-71.0491475!16zL20vMDUyamZo?hl=en",ChIJhdC_YH1w44kRSX0V1oo9pt0,Aquarium,5.0,New England Aquarium,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgTScwA09iRDFo27yZQLWdHNvLlSDFPjx0F894=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"Strongly recommend getting here early as it gets busy very quickly & we visited late April.
Main aquarium tank is enormous and accessed via a circular ramp that ascends 4 floors. At the bottom of the tank was a penguin colony which was being cleaned out by staff when we arrived shortly after it had opened. Most of the cleaning was by hand so I guess to minimise any impact on the penguins.
As you ascend the ramp there is lots of information about marine life/environments etc with additional tanks on each floor to demonstrate these varying environments.
It was really fascinating. You really get different views of the tank as you ascend, all the different species they have at various levels within the tank. You may get to see divers in the tank feeding the fish, I’m assuming they do this for a couple of reasons 1) entertainment 2) ensures most fish get food at some point.
There is a separate tank area where there are Rays which you can stroke and was popular with smaller children. Also they had Sea Lions in a separate area and were used to perform a show at certain times, we didn’t see this so can’t comment on it.
I think my son & I were in there for about 4 hrs but could easily have spent more time in there but we were on a limited time frame.

"I've been coming to the New England Aquarium since I was a child. Either it has gotten smaller, or I've gotten bigger - when I was younger I used to think it was immense. But now it seems much smaller, especially to other aquariums I've visited. The main tank, which is still impressively massive, was refaced a few years ago and is now a 'Caribbean reef' instead of basically a shark and large creature tank. Personally I liked the old tank better. The coral in the tank is in poor condition - there just isn't enough light for the coral to thrive and a lot of the more colorful fish would be better presented in a smaller tank, I think.

I did like the new sea dragon, with leafy and weedy sea dragons, display, although we saw a similar display in Melbourne which was better (of course, Melbourne is a bit closer to where they actually live!)

I was also sad that the sea lions and dolphins that used to inhabit the Discovery barge are gone, along with the barge!

All in all, we went through the entire aquarium, including visiting the harbor seals and the cafeteria, at a very slow pace, in a little under two hours. At $50 for one adult and one child ticket, that seemed like a poor value to me. Also, we happened to visit on a day when there were several high school groups visiting so the aquarium was super super crowded.

Overall the aquarium was fun and interesting. The best part was being able to pet the sting rays and sharks.

"You definitely must see the aquarium, when you visit Boston. The first thing you see when you get inside are penguins, and you just can't stand the cuteness! The whole 4 levels of the building are centered around the huge water tank with sharks, mantas, giant turtles and lots of fish of all kinds. You can pick your spot and watch them for hours! Other smaller tanks are on the outer walls, there you can see herring, water horses, golden eels, jellyfishes and other ocean creatures, also they have a contact tank for kids to explore crabs. Hint #1: buy tickets online - the price is the same as in their ticket office, but you don't have to wait a long line under the sun. Hint #2: if you have a small baby with you - take it in a ergo carrier; if your kid can walk - let him walk - leave a stroller on the first level. It gets crowded there and it takes time to squeeze with a stroller, kids get bored and anxious and you end up rolling the empty stroller after your running kid.

"I got to pet a shark... do I need to say more?

Ok, I'll tell you! First thing you see are harbor seals right out front in a big glass tank. Don't worry, they're really sealed in there. When you go in, you bang a left and they have sting rays and sharks that you can pet! Once you meet the rays, you have no choice but to forgive them for Steve Irwin. They're just so friendly!
Next there's a big penguin enclosure with a bunch of small dudes in tuxedos pointedly ignoring you. Uppity jerks. But then you start walking around the big tank, which is basically a national geographic special irl. All the awesome critters you used to see on discovery Channel are here! It's a stratified mockup of a coral reef, and you walk up the ramp, checking out all the tropical fish,  sharks, and even a trio of sea turtles! At first the turtles were hiding and refusing to hang out and be cool, but after lunch they perked up and started swimming around. Best trip I've taken in a long time!

Now the negatives:  the parking garage is stupid expensive. $40 for 2 - 24 hours, so either make alternative parking plans, or plan your day withing walking distance. The gift shop is pricey, but worth it. There's not much in the way of affordable food nearby, so if you're on a budget, either pack a lunch or budget more for food.

"Great aquarium, with an intuitive layout for both large and small groups. The main part of the aquarium has a central pillar which is one of the world's largest fish tanks, and branching off of it are multiple floors of separate tanks.
The residents include piranhas, penguins, a set of extremely large turtles, electric eels, and seals!
In terms of interactive education, the aquarium provides a plethora of demos on each floor, and includes a tidal pool manned by staff to answer all your aquatic queries.
For lunch, you can either go to the cafeteria or step outside to walk about a mile to pretty much anywhere to eat.
The entire building, food court and all, is wheelchair accessible and definitely deserves five stars.
My single qualm with the place is its hours. Many times you find your outing to the place cut short due to closing time, but this too is justified, because the fish need specialized care too after all, and the marine biologists caring for them can't go back and forth between tourists and fish continuously.

A wonderful aquarium next to the sea. Winding circular route takes you up different levels around the main tank.

"Small aquarium with some interesting points. The main tank in the middle has a very interesting walkway where you can glimpse lots of marine life and even the 90yo turtle. They have a few unique open air penguin exhibits that are fun to look at. The reason I gave 3 star is because even though I love looking at animals, some of the exhibits seemed too small to be comfortable for the marine life. This includes the octopus that kept on anxiously  flitting from side to side of it's tiny tank. Their seal exhibit is quite small and looks a bit crowded for the amount of seals they have in there.

"We were in Boston on a cold December Sunday and decided the aquarium would be a good place to get warm and spend some time.

The setup of the aquarium has you start with penguins, and who doesn't like penguins? We watched a little show also about penguins and it was very interesting. The aquariums main large circular tank spirals through the center of the building and goes from top to bottom. On the opposite wall from the tank on each floor are some different exhibits, some interactive. The staff was super friendly.

We also went outside to a small theatre and watched a show on seal training. That was actually really fun and the seals were great. Some of them were rescued and all of them liked to ham it up for the crowd and their meals or fish treats.

The cost of entrance was a bit expensive, about $75.00 for the three of us. We did get a discount for being AAA member and my daughter's university discount.

We got in with our Go Boston pass which made it well worth our time. Originally came at 1pm but on advice from some locals left and came back at 3:30 when there was less student groups. This place was really really cool! The penguins alone made it something I have never experienced so close before and all the workers made it very interactive. The aquarium in the center of the building was massive! At the top there was some demonstrations and got to see them feeding the turtles which was incredible in itself.

"Main takeaways: not worth the price, but the kids did have fun. The exhibit was small, very warm (no ac even in Summer), and the main thing is that the dinosaurs appear to be inflatable? And in very poor condition (missing teeth, hair and feathers missing in large patches, sections of the inflatable not working etc.) the lighting is also very low and odd. It seems designed to be scary and colorful maybe, instead of actually being able to see any detailing on the creatures. I paid $25 per person (including the kids) and you can see the exhibit in 15-20 minutes (reading all of the educational material). It just isn’t worth it.

The only reason this isn’t a 1 star or a complaint to the organization for a refund, is that the kids did have fun. The dinosaurs are touchable (probably why they are in such terrible condition). And there is an interactive coloring program at the end that is pretty good (but even that was glitchy.)",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa2NqSDJRRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dino+Safari+Boston:+A+Walk-Thru+Adventure/@42.9161377,-71.8822557,9z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e371a4e43be949:0xf28f02a7abf984e2!8m2!3d42.3597994!4d-71.0545357!16s%2Fg%2F11p676q92g?hl=en",ChIJSek75KRx44kR4oT5q6cCj_I,Exhibit,2.0,Dino Safari Boston: A Walk-Thru Adventure,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMujw1pvPz8j8jaU-OkcvqrIkqfnwxDMa6mHDxN=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"NOT WORTH THE COST!!!
Save your money, and use the $25 for something that is more than 10 mins long. Also for $75 we could have   had hours worth of fun some where else in the city rather than 10 mins.

Is it a fun experience for children ages 3 to 12, yes! If money is NOT a worry for you then go and enjoy yourself. Our child had a great time for the 15 mins. However, $25 for adults and children is absolutely ridiculous. At BEST this is should cost $12 for adults $5 for children.

The only reason they can get away with charging such an absurd price is because it is in Faneuil Hall.

"After a few years of renting boats from a local competitor that always had issues (non existent bimini, broken gas gauge, engine that was leaking gas, dirty and old boats, etc), i decided to try a new rental place.

I rented the 18 foot 150hp Bowrider.  There were no massive issues like before.  The boat was clean, fast, and fun.  The stereo didn't work but we had a wireless water proof speaker for this anyways.  We rented for 3 days and came back once for a fuel up in between.

The only downside was that we hit an underwater log in the middle of the lake.  They showed me the damage to the skeg and as I had taken a pic of the prop/skeg before the rental, it was undeniable.  Got hit with a $350 charge for repair, but I can't blame Yankee as this is part of the risk of boating.

I will be renting from Yankee from now on.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4eGJmSFhnEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yankee+Marina+and+Boat+Rentals/@43.8662905,-75.787001,7z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89dfc2e7994b30b3:0xb3bcbc5deff0a30?hl=en",ChIJszBLmefC34kRMAr_3sXLOws,Boat rental service,5.0,Yankee Marina and Boat Rentals,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSYtd8Jb7F-pKx91q_gwmM2VXzJkXn-O1aOla1=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"We love Nickelodeon Universe!!!! They've got rides for toddlers, big kids and adults; face painting, caricatures, airbrush shirts. I've taken my kids multiple times and we all love it. Perfect anyday, especially if the weather outside is rainy/snowy/cold. Family friendly. Relatively clean environment. Nice selection of thrill and not so intimidating rides. I haven't experienced it, but they have a quiet/low stimulation room for those with autism as well. We went around Xmas and I was expecting crazy crowds. But it wasnt bad at all. There may be long lines for some rides but they move pretty fast. Most popular rides may have 30-40 minute wait times. There are places to sit and restrooms sprinkled throughout Nick Universe so you dont have to roam through the mall to find relief. Less crowded in the evenings after dinnertime. Wristbands allow all day access and wristband packages let you experience Nick Universal and other attractions like Sea World, Crayola Experience, mini golf, escape rooms, Fly Over America, etc. You can leave and come back to see the universe all lit up.

"A kid themed, kid friendly theme park that 90s kids will love too, not just for the nostalgia, but also for the rides. The rides are thrilling without being too intense.

The fairly odd parents coaster was a lot of fun because it spun around while you were on it, the sponge Bob roller coaster was a pretty standard coaster, and my SO enjoyed the mutant scrambler. I like the jimmy neutron ride, but I apparently get motion sickness -_-. I used to ride 6 Flags Magic Mountain rides no problem. :(

They sell motion sickness medication at the nick shops. Just make sure to take it beforehand.

Overall, best theme park because you don’t have to wait outside in a hot sun and it’s indoors.

"Auntie had the BEST Sunday Fun-day date with her Godson at this place! I'd never been to Nickelodeon Universe so didn't know what to expect but it was a definitely a blast. My little guy is 5. There are tons of rides and activities for him (some you can even hop on as chaperone without an upcharge!). The line to the play area was a wait so be prepared but for most of the others the wait isn't too bad. One tip: avoid the Caribou. The staff are not trained to manage a coffee shop and that was the longest wait we had all day for a simple coffee cooler. There's a Starbucks at the opposite end of the park. Just get there before the line gets too long! You will need caffeine to keep up with your littles! Loved the Dora Ferris Wheel, Crazy Car and Bus for the kids. And the Ninja Turtles made an appearance for pictures, at no extra cost! Points band are reasonable and there are many options. Wear comfortable shoes and make sure your phone is charged because 6ou will want lots of pics!

"Theme park in the center of MOA. Nice theme park, reasonably clean and well maintained. Staff are typically younger, but this didn't stop a couple of them from chatting with my babbling toddler. They have a nice mix of rides for both older children and younger. I really appreciate that the chaperone doesn't need to pay to ride with the toddler.

"Needs better training for staff.  My 3 and 5 year olds love Adventure Bay and brought them there for the 5+  times since it open.  However, I observed something very concerning yesterday that needs to be addressed to the teenage workers. Better training for all staff.

There were still time to play, but some families were leaving. The worker was kind enough to open the exit gate for people to leave, but then at one point, a kid no more than two years old walked towards the gate and he opened it to allow the kid to leave on his own. The staff wasn't paying attention at all to who he was letting out. The parent was busy with her other child who was still inside. As you know, the place gets super busy for parents to keep an eye on every children and she could have done better too, but how does an employee just let a small child leave on their own without an adult!! Right before I was going to address this, (I had two children who were still in the playground to watch as well), the mother finally realized it and ran to her child who was at least 10 yards away thru the gate in a very busy area.  When I addressed this with the teenage employee, he seemed very clueless about his action and did not understand the magnitude for his mistake. I get that other families were leaving, but this child was a completely different race, so even that should have at least alerted him that he should not open the gate for a kid that is by himself.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzdDVEckN3EAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nickelodeon+Universe%C2%AE/@44.8547397,-97.8562833,7z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x87f624366fd51ad9:0xe2c5bc99e5482bb5!8m2!3d44.8547397!4d-93.2420255!16zL20vMDFwdF9r?hl=en",ChIJ2RrVbzYk9ocRtStI5Zm8xeI,Theme park,2.0,Nickelodeon Universe®,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOo7HD40FqKgi1yVjAqFWpvz2XrNUzNTiBaN4TD=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

There aren't any rides for toddlers.. But this place is awesome al of the roller coasters were fun! My husband and sons had their pictures sketched

The high ropes course and zipline looked awesome, but it was a separate cost from the points system. Overall, I wasn't impressed.

This was impressive especially with it all being in a mall. My kids face looked like Christmas morning..LOL. because we were tourist we got the Big Ticket Adventure Pass which was nice because it gave us a all day pass to Nick U.

"This park pays homage to a lot of great shows that older people and younger have had in their lives. Seeing some of your favorite childhood friends being represented by a roller coaster and/or a giant version of them is amazing.

A lot of the rides are underwhelming but there are a few that really stand above the rest. It's obvious that Spongebob's Rock bottom is really a highlight attraction for the park. With not only the most excitement offered for a ride there and with it's intimate connection to the episode of spongebob it's derived from. Up until my attempt to ride this attraction I was super impressed with the staff's ability to load people on rides and keep everything flowing well. The attendant at the spongebob ride was either very ill or extremely hungover. Every step seeming like an even heavier burden on him. Watching a coaster fly around for a minute and then waiting till just before he needs to open the gate to take long drinks out of a water bottle. And some of the slowest checking for seat belts and safety things being in place I've ever seen. Ironically another concern is his ability to pay attention to what he needs to because he just seemed so out of it.

Paying the minimum amount for a wristband to share with my family to go on a few rides is still 54$. After a day of spending too much money at other stores and trying to end it with some great characters and rides we cherish, we left disappointed.

Still an amazing place.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxejZLMGV3EAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nickelodeon+Universe%C2%AE/@44.8547397,-97.8562833,7z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x87f624366fd51ad9:0xe2c5bc99e5482bb5!8m2!3d44.8547397!4d-93.2420255!16zL20vMDFwdF9r?hl=en",ChIJ2RrVbzYk9ocRtStI5Zm8xeI,Theme park,2.0,Nickelodeon Universe®,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXBhQShTMTXeeXghb0WfNGE3MbVS32j3bsRAU=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"Three wristbands were purchased for this visit. For the most part this was a very good visit. I've been here multiple times with my kids. Usually, with my two older ones. I did bring the two year old almost three year old this time. We did decide to go on the Dora Azul Train ride pretty basic right.  She met all the requirements for the ride, but I soon realized I may need to accompany her on the ride. I assume the attendant would understand and allow me to ride with my daughter, no that was not the case.
I was told NO!! Unless, I brought a ticket. I said, ""she not going to stay seated she doesn't understand you."" The attendant still say no and started the ride. My daughter stood up the attendant had to get on the mic and tell her to sit down and I said again she doesn't understand you. Can I now get on the ride and he said yes.
I soon realized I may need to go talk to a manager so I can let them know what is going on and get permission for the kids rides as chaperone capacity but was that's not possible. I got frustrated and blurted out that she is on the Spectrum which I wanted to avoid in the first place.

They offer food, and drinks at the field at fair prices and the field paint is reasonably priced also.

"Visited from out of town and spent family time at the Dakota Zoo.

I'm used to bigger zoos that are very crowded and the animals are 20 feet away.  I was expecting to see animals I see at my home zoo; I was wrong.  The variety and habitats of the animals is fun and interesting.

The zoo was not crowded.  My family could wander around at their own pace.  The zoo is very well covered by trees which provide shade in many places.  The paths are a bit run down, but fine for wheelchairs and strollers.  We did not have a map of the zoo which made it confusing to me.  My daughter knew her way around and there are info signs periodically to show the exhibit locations.

I did not see many food stands that I'm used to in bigger zoos.  I think everything is near the entrance.

"I finally got a chance to check this place out. Most of the barcades are in Charlotte so it's nice to have one close to home. I went on a Thursday night which is ""guys night"" and was welcomed as soon as I walked in, both the owners and the guests were very friendly. For Thursdays, about all games were free (at least for dudes) except for pinball, which were .50 a game. Normally it's $5 a person for unlimited play and pinball is $1.00 a game (ouch to $1.00 pinball!). There were maybe 6 to 12 people rotating in and out while I was there, so not crowded at all. Parking was abundant. It's about a 5 minute walk from Freeman's. Bar can turn cash to quarters or can give you quarters from your bar tab for a 10% surcharge. Bar had food and drinks at fair prices. There are 2 gender neutral restrooms. There are a few TV's playing sports and comic book movies and YouTube videos. Place was open until midnight on a weeknight which was cool. There was one tv hooked up to a Nintendo 64 with a pretty large assortment of games. There were a couple party/board games sitting near a table. There was a fairly large area for outdoor seating as well. I think what made this visit special was how friendly the owners and guests were, felt like you were just visiting old friends instead of strangers.

EDIT: Citycade did a reconfiguration and brought in a racing game, a shooting game, a beer pong game and a couple of pay to win games disguised as games of skill. I believe at this point they've gotten rid of the $5 cover entirely and just made the machines take quarters, which I think was a good move. Pinball is still a buck which is a bummer since there are better options out there for $.50 a game, but it's close to home at least and the price point isn't uncommon. Pinball seems maintained and Citycade has occasionally swapped out for different pins, which is nice. Bathrooms are always clean which is a plus. Only complaint is that sometimes it can get a bit hot in the building.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdmFxUllnEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/CityCade+Classic+Arcade+and+Pinball+Game+Bar,+Gastonia+NC/@35.2341215,-81.0537741,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8856c1b3a8efdad9:0xd240e10ee1ba3f55!8m2!3d35.2632135!4d-81.1797882!16s%2Fg%2F11j7k_xln2?hl=en",ChIJ2drvqLPBVogRVT-64Q7hQNI,Bar,5.0,"CityCade Classic Arcade and Pinball Game Bar, Gastonia NC",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOYNN5y6gNITGaKA6YxbJtiodU2YD_0tsylVxD=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

Such fun when our Swedish relatives gathered  at Funcity  for our annual December  celebration. This year we jumped for joy at Funcity trampoline park in New Britain, CT.

In a party room we shared a meal 🍱 , enjoyed a Swedish 🇸🇪 show & tell, and ended with a children’s book 📕 exchange.

In the trampoline playground, both young & old LOVED 🥰 the toddler trampolines, bubble court, foam pit, zip line, dodge ball court, foam Legos, slides, rope course, climb wall, massage chairs, video games, trampolines, etc.

"Our first time here,  the kids had a blast.  Typical price for a trampoline park spent $66 for 3 kids.  Love the fact they had a food court here most the ones we been to don't so it was nice to eat and jump.  The pizza was good,  I feel the prices are just a little bit much for the frozen items you get but they weren't bad just reminded me of a easy finger food dinner you pop in the oven.

"Unexpectedly exceeded my expectations! This picture of my 6 year old says it perfectly. We went there for a birthday party, and the party room (with flowers) was cute. The blow up slides, arcades and toys were all working and seemed pretty clean! The adults could play on the slides too with the kids which was so fun! There is this HUGE slide by the restrooms that took my 31 year old breath away! It was intense and made me feel like a kid again. Arcades were awesome. The kids had fun turning in their tickets. And they had a small sectioned off area for the little little kids which I would've appreciated when my 6 & 8 year old were little. We had a blast.

"This was our first experience at Kangaroo Zoo. We came to the NSL location. We weren’t overly impressed.. It’s.. very well loved.. we’ll put it that way. A few of the inflatables could definitely be replaced. They aren’t fully flown up (I’m sure there’s a leak or something) and have lots of wear and tear. With it not being fully inflated, it makes it hard for the kids to play in them because they fall with almost every step, especially when exiting the inflatable. The games are new and nice. The party rooms looked cute, but i just peeked in through the windows. My kids were SUPER disappointed that the ball activity wasn’t working! And the entire place could use a good cleaning for sure. Once of the couches is broken and sagging.. and multiple chairs are cracked. The tables and chairs are white, and suuper  dirty. Our kids had fun, but wanted to leave after 45 minutes. I also don’t love that I had to pay $10 for my babies to come in. They are 1 and 2, but I feel like they can’t use 98% of the equipment here. The only thing they could have really done is play with the balls.. but that was broken.

Perks- Looks like it would be a fun place to go to for a birthday party and the prices are very reasonable. Lots of places for parents to sit with a good view at each place.

"Mark and Tera,

Thank you so much for your hospitality and service on Saturday.  Our large youth group absolutely loved their time spent on the inflatables at Island Park.  Loved it so much, some of them were hard to get back off!  It really added to a great day and both of you were so great to work with along with your sweet daughter.

"Great place, definitely glad to have it near us. Yes it costs more than Hang Time, but it has more to offer. Plus a bunch of couches and several massage chairs for adults.
At Hang Time I'm always worried about where my smaller kids are because you can't keep a good eye everywhere. Feels like it's for older kids and young adults with more trampolines for tricks.

What I like about The Hive it's good for kids of all ages. There's a tetherball with jumping around it. Two interactive video game screens that actually show their picture on screen as they jump, so fun!
Zip line, jumping basketball, targets, go carts (costs extra), the biggest bounce house/obstacle course I've ever seen. Regular trampolines too, rock wall, ninja warrior obstacles, slack line.

There are drinking fountains, but they're by the go carts (kind of annoying they're so far).
They also have bands to wear that have lights that change color when your time is up. They do have lockers as well.
Overall, we'll go again, but less frequently because of the cost.

"Spent several hours reading my book while my 11 and 14-year-old boys got plenty of exercise. (Adults don’t have to pay if they don’t plan on jumping) Many clean and comfortable couches to choose from for parents who want to relax and lots of fun activities for kids of all ages. I saw many small children and big children playing on many different things and it’s big enough that nobody was getting in each others way.

Really nice everything brand new really big but long-term price won’t work. We definitely will be going to the other trampoline places then to come here because of the prices. Arcade is over priced for what you can win. Which is like that almost everywhere. I do love that they have so many couches and lots of areas for the parents to sit and watch kids. Oh and you have to have non-grip socks and they don’t tell you that when you come in and they do not have prices for the Sox listed on their board either. They are three dollars a pair of socks and they don’t have any deals on them like if you buy multiple or a pack or anything to save money which is kind of crazy because if I knew beforehand I could’ve bought some online for way cheaper from somewhere else. I like that you have to wear a electronic wristband that has a green and red light to tell you when your time is up. Everything is very Clean because it is a brand new building and equipment.

"This was a fantastic adventure. I would recommend going as a group of 2 or more. As this would be a very bland one person experience. The other people make it a blast.

Its relatively cheap, only about 10$ a person, for an hour or longer depending on the size of your group.

If I had to describe my least favorite experience, it would be the lack of variety of some hole layouts. Few are rather creative, and have some cool glow in the dark features. Most are fairly straight forward and require very little creativity to sink the putt. I would have liked to have seen holes that allowed two or three different ways to complete them. Even this was not enough to deter me from having a great time at low cost.

They do offer different types of discounts and party plans. This was an excellent way to have fun out of the sun. The staff was friendly and courteous.

Also they have really respected the social distancing brought on by COVID19. Each putter and ball is wiped and sanitized before each new user. They require masks which can be fun if you get one that looks cool in the black light.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDak0tTlNREAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Glow+Putt+Mini+Golf/@33.6993582,-115.3475306,7z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x872b753fac1e0b65:0xd04a63150126e39f!8m2!3d33.5836995!4d-111.8837386!16s%2Fg%2F11b5wkmnp1?hl=en",ChIJZQserD91K4cRn-MmARVjStA,Miniature golf course,5.0,Glow Putt Mini Golf,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIme29YPCaxAHciLs8sky7Cqp64KfDEpakRWEd=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"Here’s some helpful info if you’re going during Aurora/Christmas time. We were able to get into the park pretty quickly; there were two lines - one for buying tickets and one for scanning them if you purchased them online (which we did). So we only had to stand in one line. We decided to get the meal included in our combo passes right away and ended up waiting 30+ minutes in a crowded line at Kettle Cafe to order and get our food. We were incredibly lucky because we found a 4 person table that cleared inside with 3 seats so our kids were able to sit there and my husband and I stood shoulder to shoulder to eat our food. Most people probably had to eat outside in the freezing cold. They told us they were out of desserts, so we didn’t get to order them. But lo and behold, the dessert window was full of fresh new desserts just a couple minutes after we got our food. This was frustrating because we knew we’d have to wait in yet another line to get the desserts included in our combo passes.
The wait for the train ended up being 55 minutes, plus a couple more sitting on the train waiting for it to go. This was pretty excruciating because it got down to 15 degrees the night we were there and there was no heating in the line which is covered by a roof but fully outdoors. We had really bundled up but it was still super cold. Our kids were troopers and hung in there because they really wanted to ride the train, which of course ended up not being worth a 10 minute wait let alone nearly an hour long wait in sub freezing temps.
So after we got that out of the way, we waited in the confectioner shop for cookies since we weren’t able to get the desserts we’d waited for earlier in the evening. Another 10+ minute wait but at least it was indoors which was actually pretty nice because we couldn’t feel our fingers or toes by then (we were all wearing thick socks, snow boots, and gloves just for the record).
We spent a short while exploring outside but weren’t clear on where to go to do a quest. The map on the website isn’t very helpful because you can’t zoom in and actually read the words on it.
Going to Evermore is something different to try at Christmas time, but a lot of waiting in lines if you want food and especially if you want to ride the train.

"I visited evermore on a Friday evening with my husband at the start of Mythos season. We ate at Vander’s keep to start our evening. I recommend the butter toffee beer! It has a horchata-esque creamy cinnamon taste to it. Yum! I wish there were free refills. We tried the poutine, patty melt and deer meat. It was all delicious except the vinicent was kinda nasty, a crazy flavor if you aren’t expecting it! The prices were also more steep than I was expecting.
Then we ventured into the park itself. We wandered up the eastern side and noticed lots of unfinished buildings and construction, so our first impression wasn’t the greatest. But then we stumbled upon the renaissance fair activity area with archery, knife throwing, and dueling and that was a blast! We loved exploring the mausoleum and talking with the evermorians. It was fun to chat with the barmaid while taking shelter from the cold air. I liked how compact the park was so that you could run around completing quests and not get too worn out.
The hand crafted shops were fun, some prices more reasonable than others.
Overall a fun experience that is very unique! I only wish they would give you a guide/notebook with the activities listed, times, and conversation starters so that wasn’t so confusing. With some more work this place could be amazing. I can’t wait to see how it develops in the future.

Pros:
-Delicious Restaurant Food
-Evermorians are entertaining to interact with
-Fun buildings
-Feels like you are in a different world

"Had a nice experience the park wasn’t as crowded as expected. There were times you’d have to wait to talk to characters or participate in activities. And a few things were extra. The build your own adventure style park was fun and has tons of room to expand and grow in the future! I’m excited to see the park grow and expand in future years!

That said they do need to expand some aspects of the park like having a more consistent schedule. The magic act and last circus show we attended on Thursday night was super short and was missing performers. Schedules need to be met and consistency needs to be seen in these. Also some sort of established system of barter and trade consistency would be nice to see.

"So this last Saturday the 4th of June was me and family's first time at Evermore. Holy heck did we have a blast. And we didn't even really do everything. There truly is so much to do and enjoy for everyone.  My daughters ran on quests to join the rogue elves guild, my 4 yr old joined the fairy guild and won the kiddo costume contest and my son who has no idea about fantasy dove right in when in the arena lol. Not knowing how to really interact made it a challenge but the Evermorians there made it really easy to do when they engaged with us. So even if your shy and nervous and dont know what to do someone will send a smile and interact with you, but its up to you to interact back just play with it and have fun.
Diego the orc was an absolute blast and my family chatted with him every chance they got.  All the fairys knew my daughter by name and would say Hi every time they saw us walking around. Sir Darlan as well took it upon himself to show her how to use a foam sword when she nervously asked him if she could touch the swords by the dueling area. Basically I just wanted to be able to say a true thank you to all involved for making this trip a truly memorable experience and one that will be repeated in years to come.

"What a beautiful winter adventure! Evermore is such a fun place with a choose-your-own-adventure vibe. My hubby and I spoke to Tundra Maximus the miner and explored the village and even a castle while we picked up side quests along the way. We warmed up with a little hot cider on our way to find Winter Weavers (elegant winter elves!). There were local vendors features handmade costume pieces, sculptures, etc. We wanted to free the ice giant but our dinner reservation came first, so we hustled to Vander's Keep. Oh my was the food delicious! Samantha Fox, our server, let us know the beef stew was inspired by a 19th century recipe and braised for hours. My husband loved his pork chops and I devoured my venison with chili-citrus ginger glaze, which was served a perfect medium rare. The classic cocktails were on point too.

"First time going to the park and was impressed.  Our group of 8 with kids from 14 to 6 all had a good time.  The younger ones enjoyed the circus tent, animal show, and fire dancers, while the older took some warming up to get into the ""You mean I have to actually talk to someone?"" idea.

"We visited on a Saturday early September with a 4 year old and 2 year old. This isn’t for young children thats why 5 and under are free. It did cost $20 for adults. Any sort of activities inside is gonna cost you. The train was broken so that was a bummer. We watched the magic show and fire dancer.

Now, the real entertainment here which makes it worth $20 IMO, are for the nerds. I myself being a nerd enjoyed taking on quests with my little boy. He actually talked to the “NPCs” (as I call them lol) Now this is not for everyone. It involves being social and role-playing which could be weird and funny. You are in charge of your own adventure. If you don’t talk to people, you won’t get any quests. The mayor was super nice and accommodating to my 4 yr old. One of the blackheart guild members humored us and said my son was getting 55 EXP and leveling up soon. That made my son excited to take on the quest. They do get rewarded with gold for completing quests though. The employees stay in character while talking to each other 🤣. I appreciated that and it added to the immersion. We did not do the haunted adventure because it costs an extra $15 and too scary for the littles. The park is small, so if you pay that extra 15 you get to go to a different side of the park. That is why you need to really be into quests otherwise you could be done in a 30 minute visit and be completely underwhelmed.

There were a lot of single goers enjoying themselves too. There were some straight up characters. I got confused who worked there and who didn’t haha.

"I'm between a 3 and a 4 star experience here. The actors are fully committed and extremely fun to interact with. Most of the site is fairly polished but there are some areas in need of tlc ( boarded up buildings etc) The concept of this place is so fun and I love the welcoming feel for all types. Very fun to see all the different guests dressing up. Some major pain pains were the confusing ""quests"" and the difficulty in finding an adult beverage on the property. Our group had no idea how to go about ""joining a guild"" or in ""completing a quest"" that was mentioned at the entrance. Some people in our party wanted to grab a drink while there and the only place was the onsite restaurant. When we asked at the front they told us we could sit at the bar and grab a drink as long as we purchased food ( standard utah law) but when we went inside they said we needed a reservation and we couldn't sit at the bar until after 9:45pm ( not a utah law requirement fyi) pretty annoying. We ended up making a reservation and wow, the food was super over priced and extremely underwhelming. We ended up sending back the chocolate cake (super stale) The drinks were watered down and not worth the price, the time it took to get to the table and the hassle. The restaurant wasn't even half full and was still soooo slow. Cool one time experience but until they work out the annoyances it's really not worth the $19  per person fee.

"It was even better than anticipated, as the man at the door said. They are in the smaller season for evermore as they are celebrating the winter fest. He had said that winter fest allows you to experience a small amount of what evermore has to offer. And with that being said I cannot wait to see what Mythos and Lore are like! This will probably be a good tradition to integrate into my future family outings.

And I enjoyed dressing up and parading around, we also stopped at a firepit and hung around with the elf bard who entertained us with his humorous thoughts on the dust under the strings of his guitar. In which he proceeded to spit-shine and then lick it away when the first didn't work.

I asked to rent a electric scooter
I have ms and it’s difficult to walk.
Someone stole the one scooter they had? 😆 lol thats a first

But it only serves 2 desserts that could pass for McDonald’s $1 desserts
They have smaller getups
They open at 6 food (can beef stew and Mac n cheese or chicken nuggets and fries sold out by 8
We had to wait literally 30 min and another 30 min for chicken nuggets
The food definitely not amusement park quality.

I asked for a bottle water to go towards my drink
I was handed a warm bottle of water straight from the case of water plastic bag!
The guy was literally opening the can of beef stew while we waited lol
They also had a microwave

One thing I think could be improved is information about the events, shows, quests, and guilds should be more accessible and easier to understand.

"Visited Friday night with combo tickets.
Area was beautiful, well-maintained and an absolute joy to explore. At night, it is a colorful fantasy dream.

Food was 5 stars in Vander's Keep, the area tavern. Would recommend the Frye Bread and Huntsman Pie as it's a better shepherd's pie than I had in London and major kudos to the head chef. Actors and employees were all glowing, beautiful individuals who just wanted you to have a great time.

What took my review from 5 to 4 stars is two things.
First you need to scan QR codes to view the menu at Vander's Keep and to have a how-to/map for what to do in Evermore. With zero Wifi, that can prove difficult.
Also unfortunately they didn't have enough of many foods at their concession stands (where you use the credit for entree/side/drink/sweet with your combo pass) so we didn't get to use but half of our twenty-dollar combo passes.

Still worth it overall but next time we go will hopefully be able to grab food earlier without them running out or they are able to plan for a busy weedend.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eExHclZBEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,4.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPr5CbYYrG5HxJocQ1Mi_hqBQl32TT_6mymc4GP=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity
"Enjoyed my time here from a visual perspective. very well thought out as far as their displays and attractions. We went during the winter time during the Christmas festivities and got their activity pass.

Wasn’t particularly impressed with their staff. They seemed to hire highschool kids who do cosplay as a hobby. Many didn’t seem to treat it like a job. Although they were supposed to be in character I saw a lot of them on their phones and not really taking pride in their work. As the face of evermore I really expected a bit more in that capacity.

Additionally the “ice skating” was a complete waste of money. You walk onto a cold sheet of plastic with zero ice on it. They advertise it’s not true ice skating but this isn’t skating at all. It’s walking on plastic and that’s the experience. period. I am proficient at ice skating so it’s not like I didn’t know how to skate. If I went again I’d pay for general admission and that’s it.

The food was also insanely long lines (45 minutes, and this was after being told they ran out of food and we needed to come back in an hour) for great value freezer food that was reheated.

The wonderful gentle man from the Dragon trainers(?) Guild - I wish your Dragon great flight with the assistance of the power and magic of Wind. And so many more. Oh, yes, the Grand Weapons Master who stated that on that day I was his greatest challenge - and he did best me 2 of 3.
Gem & I (mage Aryk) were welcomed wonderfully to your paradise of Evermore. Your dedication to your craft blessed us many time over. Our hearts full of joy. We sincerely wished we could have blessed you in return. Some we did have the opportunity to do so. For we are from the subterranean land of Mount Shasta.  And we came with blessings of honor in the way of leather bracelets.  Common to most on the surface continents but held in the most esteem in Shasta. We found so much honor in you all.
I was able to find a crown of jewels from a local merchant in your town, which I'm certain was my true purpose for journeying to your local. Thank you.

"Evermore is a really interesting place. It's bigger on the inside than it looks. The decorations and activities are fun, and you can participate as much a you want and go on a quest, but the idea of what is happening is very esoteric to a first-time guest. There are no maps or details about what you can find and where you can find it. The quests have a very LARP-ing quality, but in lacking any kind of idea about where buildings even are, and the buildings don't have signs, it's easy to get lost and easily confused. I would visit again, though I wish it was open in day-light hours and there were more clear materials that correlated with general information (like when tournaments are and where they are/where to sign up, what things are included vs. what requires extra fees, etc).

"First time was confusing, but fantastic in the truest sense of the word. It really felt like stepping into another world! The characters were dynamic and fleshed out, the landscaping beautiful, and the buildings were a step back in time. The customer service is mostly excellent (unless talking to some of the belligerent character, who are entertaining to banter with!) Greg the fire dancer was funny and talented, a true showman.

The only reason I didn't give them five stars is some of the prices. Artisan products are expensive and that's fine. You're paying for the labor as well. But $2.50 for a Walmart water bottle is... Hard to swallow.

"I really didn't know what to expect from our outing to Evermore Park. I kept my expectations under control, meaning I didn't have any. What we found was an immersive and creative park with lots of smiles from the kids. From pottery demonstrations, axe throwing, fire dancer, pirate actors, train ride, animal show, to karaoke with hobbits and more. The booths for shopping were fun too!

Yes people dress up, yes some of it is a little ""out there."" But I did kind of enjoy being a mythical princess for the evening.

"This place is absolutely amazing! Imagine an experience similar to Disneyland, but with a focus on the environment. There aren't any rides except for a train ride around the park- but this does not mean the experience isn't worthwhile. The main attraction to Evermore is to immerse yourself in the story. Cast members dotted around the park send you on quests to get information, solve puzzles, and stop an evil set on destroying the humble town known as Evermore, all while earning ""gold"", an in-park currency you can use to purchase fun trinkets from cast members.

On top of this, there is a town square where vendors offer handmade goods, which adds to the atmosphere of a bustling medieval village. There you can buy clothing, soaps, and even adorable dragon plushies.

The icing on the cake to all of this is the park's encouragement to all of it's guests to dress for the role. You can wear your best fantasy hero outfit, or choose to go in your casual, modern attire, whatever suits you.

Very crowded, we were only able to do 1 thing there.  Archery,  we stood in line for almost an hour to shoot 3 arrows 🏹.
Tried walking around a bit but unfortunately we couldn't really see or do much of anything. We luckily were able to buy a few souvenirs before being pushed out by a crowd of people, which was scary because I had my 2 year old in my arms.
We decided to leave after that and as we got to our vehicle only to realize we were blocked in at the overflow parking area. Our car and about 8 others were trapped for about a little over an hour because another car decided to block the only way out.
I and several others tried calling the only number provided for Evermore and were told the number doesn't exist. I sent my husband to the front gate to let them know the situation and no one came for 20 minutes then they just sat there looking at the car blocking the exit instead of trying to page the owner or calling a tow truck.
Luckily 2 groups in front of our cars were leaving and by that miracle they made an opening to let us all out.

"I went during the Lore event which is dedicated to Halloween. Honestly, it wasn't that great of an experience like I had when I went to Aurora the year before.

Pros
- Atmosphere is pretty decent. It was decorated to fit the autumn and Halloween theme. There were their usual activities such as archery, knife throwing, and combat ring.

- Shops were a lot more organized. Back when I visited Aurora, the shops were just a mess. Everything was everywhere and it was extremely crowded (not with customers) but just overlapping one another. For Lore, they got that figured out, and the shops were well put together.

- Fire show was a total hit. From the little that I could see, it was amazingly enjoyable and humorous. I definitely recommend all Evermore visitors to catch at least the fire show.

Cons
- Shows. Maybe it's part of the ""fantasy / medieval"" theme where a bunch of people crowd around to watch something, but it was extremely difficult to observe their only attraction that was worth watching. They have a good amount of open space on the field that wasn't used for anything, I wonder if they could have just put up more hay bales since wooden bleachers would be too much of a cost.

- Food options were pretty limited. With Vander's Keep closed to the public, access to food was quite challenging. The ticket I purchased for Lore was a combo ticket that included an entree, drink, and dessert with the price. There were your options of soup and a burger, and the latter was a much popular choice but was served at one location. This meant a lot of people waiting in the cold for that burger lol. It was an experience for sure.

- Lines. Don't get me wrong, lines are a huge part of any theme park experience, I'm not entirely jabbing at that. However, I'm jabbing at the fact that there was little to no control of the lines. A lot of people were scheduled for a Haunted Maze experience,  but some just gave up on it because the line never shortened. It was like a horrible rush hour traffic in LA.

- Lack of interest from the NPCs is a common complaint of Evermore, and they still haven't really done anything to encourage their employees. Granted, not all are like this and are immersed into their character and the Evermore world; however, that's only an extreme few - enough to count on one hand. Yeah, not that many. I've seen and have dealt with NPCs who just looked absolutely bored. I thought it was their character concept, but when they started giving one-worded answers and even expressed boredom to people interested in partaking in their quests, it was more than enough to tell me that... they just weren't interested. Additionally, we spotted NPCs who were tucked away from the crowd and on their phones. No matter how we walked past them and waved, they kept their head down and kept browsing their phones. I could tell they were employees as well because they all had the glow-in-the-dark necklaces that only Evermore employees wore.

Honestly, if Evermore just had employees who were interested in the world their characters were in, it could help make the experience a lot more fun.

Evermore lost a lot of its ""fantasy"" theme and became a more comic-con / anime-con sort of experience. At Lore, a lot of guests had awesome costumes that were 1000% better than the employees, and it was a blast to see so many dressed up in many  different things. That was more enjoyable than what was going on at the park.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaGN2WTdnRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,2.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdaRsw2EUyQpeV8T6R-1Hxt9meDUTqSLL_MRJR=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"First time here and had truly did have a blast with my family and 3 year old! I truly do recommend you come and experience the park. BUT the park needs to figure out a few things, especially when it's crowded. A staffer told me that the day I went was one of their busiest days they've seen. It was so crowded that you had to wait in line to just get around the park to see places of the park. Even going into the park, the entrance lines were long and confusing and people were congesting the parking lot. No one knew what line was for what, the bathroom lines for the womens bathrooms on both sides were extremely long, good luck waiting in line for food and drink (they need to sell more food in the back, either shops or tiny stalls to help these crowds at the entrance), it was just utter chaos and not exactly great during COVID times. It was confusing to know who participated in the trading system. Then the Haunt event was also confusing. You buy a ticket for a time slot, but we had to wait in line an hour before our time because people would just line up for it and the line wrapped around the park. The staffers that checked our tickets didn't even ask what time slot we were. What's the point of getting a time slot? The event itself was mostly a walk-through to look at their pretty sets, not really a quest, wish it was more interactive, and then it had a rare actor jumping at you. Which, I can't completely blame the park for. They truly need more actors and staff. But currently, Haunt tickets aren't worth it. I hope they expand, get the actors and staff they need to help mitigate crowds and confusion, and seriously build bathrooms with more than 3 stalls for the women. Because aside from this utter chaos it really was fun! And I didn't even do quests because of my 3 year old! The pretty settings, face painting, the train, and watching people and actors was enough for my 3yo to have a blast. Watching people immerse themselves and do quests with the actors (when they actually got through the line to talk to them) looked super fun!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHa01HMUdREAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,3.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQVLVSon0-i34mTbBvZrSocpTO_hPC9XmctwP_=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity
I liked Evermore and it is probably something I will continue to do with my family every once in a while. I think the entrance fee of $15 was fair as well as the $3 fee to ride the train that wraps around the park. They do charge $2.50 for a bottle of water which i feel is too much. If they would lower that price I feel the experience would be better. The actors were very kind and did a wonderful job. The scenery was awesome and I hope they continue to grow.

"Update: we hit Octoberfest tonight and “The Twins” are pretty much the funniest two people our family has ever encountered!  Thank you for an unforgettable night❤️

Our 14 year old son lives for this place.  Wear a costume and join in.  It’s definitely a role playing fantasy community and not Disneyland.  If you come expecting rides and Evermore merchandise for sale and lots of instructions and rules, you will be surprised.  This is not a typical amusement park.  The grounds are gorgeous and we can see the vision they have with all the projects they are working on.  It’s going to be even more stunning down the road.  The cast here is so much fun and they interact nonstop with the people in the park.  Don’t be shy!  Chat with everyone and after a little while you’ll lose yourself.  So many nice places to sit and hang out.  We bought an ancient game called Hnefatalf and sat in the Pygmeweeds Inn and played while listening to live music.

It took us some time to figure out what to do or how to play. There are so many things to do or see. Different types of quests. My younger kids gave up on the Quest and ended up trading the entire time. Ended up leaving with lots of fun trinkets. The shows were great we ended up staying until closing time. I wish there were more food options. And a few of the buildings were closed. The guy in the tavern working was so kind to my kids. He played betting games with them for quite awhile.

"We visited for the first time during the 2020 Christmas season.  Highly recommend paying extra for the Christmas Carol experience, it was amazing! The acting - especially the parts of Scrooge and Charles Dickens - was excellent, better than we expected. The way you follow the characters through the park to different locations as the story unfolds was unique and so much fun! There were indoor and outdoor settings - some of which are only accessible for Christmas Carol attendees. The Christmas Carol experience was slightly interactive also, which made it even better.  Our young adult children all loved it, as did we. We would go back again for that alone! The Christmas Carol takes about an hour (we wouldn't have wanted it any shorter, we enjoyed it so much), so we didn't have as much time as we had hoped to see the rest of the park before it closed. So, if you are doing the Christmas Carol, be sure to leave extra time before or after to enjoy the rest of the park. The archery and ax throwing ends at 9:30, and the lines were a little long before that, so we didn't do either. Most of the actor characters we came into contact with were easy to talk to, and we really enjoyed our interactions with them! But some were too preoccupied with their interactions with other actors/characters to talk to us, so that was a little disappointing. The costuming is excellent, and the overall feeling within the park is magical.  Sometimes it was hard to tell between the paid actors and visiting patrons who dressed up, but the glowing necklaces helped. We enjoyed the fire dancers and the puppet show, and the hot chocolate was delicious! If you dress warm, the cold isn't so bad, and there are plenty of fire pits throughout the park to warm up by.

"Having been to Evermore for both their ""Lore"" Halloween quests, and now their ""Aurora"" Christmas quests, I can officially say that I have seen them take a good thing, and turn it into something spectacular!

Overall for my first experience in Evermore at Halloween time, I found that the sets were AMAZING and very magical, the actors were fun and for the most part kind, and that I had a good time. Would have given it 4 stars. The negative things were that they had NO crowd management so it was very difficult to talk to the actors, and the quests were too long to finish in a night so you'd have to leave with one half completed, and the food was not very good or varied. I left with the park having taken my breath away, but the experience not one that I was completely satisfied with.

This time, ALL of the negative things I didn't like about the first time were fixed. The actors were spread out all over the park, so even though there were more people than the first time we went (The parking lot was overfilling) we never felt crowded. The actors were amazing, and so kind, and they worked hard to make sure that everyone got a turn to talk to them. The quests were short, and fun. We able to complete a few of them, even after not staying the whole time (We saved a robot from the cold, and made peace between three different groups of people!). The food was also way better. There were meat-pies, soup, hot chocolate, and it wasn't too expensive! We treated our group to 3 dollar hot chocolates and it helped everyone warm up and take a break without breaking the bank. :)

And, for those of you wondering, this experience is great for families. We had a baby, and a toddler in our group, and we found we could get through almost everywhere with our stroller, and that the actors worked to have the 4 year old toddler have a good time and understand what he needed to do to help the people of evermore. (At one point we wanted to take a break, and he wouldn't let us because he wanted to get the cure to the robot first!) :)

So, all in all, I would highly recommend going. My husband and I didn't dress up or cosplay (nor do we usually do that kind of thing) but we had a ton of fun regardless. There's something for everyone there: Bird shows, quests, a scavenger hunt, fun picture places, etc. So bring the whole family and take place in something that you will be talking about for forever. :)

UPDATE: Evermore is still amazing!! The addition of trading trinkets in the park, local artist vendors, and Vander Keep have made it even better than it was before. My recommendations- Bring things to trade, get a toffee butterbeer from Vander's keep, and say ""hi"" to the ""Happy Viking"" vendor -His stuff is great, and he is so kind!

"We went here the day after Christmas 2020 and took our four little kids with us. The kids say their favorite thing was the fire dancers that went on every hour. They also enjoyed the bird and reptile show and the knife throwing. I really like the architecture of the buildings and the lights were beautiful. We also rode the train around the park and had fun looking at all the lights and buildings.  If there was one point of criticism, it had to be the radio station being played on the train ride, it wasn't really consistent with the theme of the park and broke the immersion in the park's atmosphere.
The characters we talked to were all interesting with their own stories to tell. Definitely going to spend more time talking to characters and doing quests when we go without little kids. The other visitors were also very friendly and sometimes it was hard to tell them from the Evermore characters if it weren't for the glowing pendants that the actors wore.
The food we had there was very good and service was great.

"We had a great night at EverMoore park! (We went to Lore, which is the Halloween theme this year) Opened at 6:00. Closed at midnight. You could definitely keep busy the entire 6 hours. Get there at least 30 min early. Come on costume if you can because it really adds to your experience but even if you don't you will have a great time.

Frustrations....
- Getting tickets online. The site is challenging and very frustrating to navigate. Finally got it to work after a long time.
- getting food was a long wait. Not enough people helping to move quickly. The shorter line for treats was 30 min just to get to the window. They were out of water and diet drinks. They didn't tell us that right next door in the gift shop they had water and diet coke and treats. Which is what we wanted. The churro doughnut was good!!
- no social distancing was going on. The bird show, that we really enjoyed was packed shoulder to shoulder as was the magic show.

Positives...
-The cast is AWESOME! They are engaging, patient and fun!
- Something for every age going on!
- Everyone wore a mask!!!
-The park is beautiful and impressive! The buildings and grounds are so will done with attention to detail.
-They have their own professionally done soundtrack on spotify under EverMoore park.
-They have a train, haunted walk through, bird show, magic show, archery, larping, a giant troll roaming around and entertainment everywhere. Photo opportunities were everywhere.

Go right when they open so you can see the park while it's light and then enjoy it in the dark. So much to see and so original! Get a map before you go in and it will tell you all the activities available. You can join one of the many guilds, (pirates, knights, witches, ect.) that they have, by going on quests and then you are initiated into their clan. It's very fun!

"Valentine's Day dinner experience was like being stuck at point of the mountain during rush hour. You're just stuck in the miserable experience with everyone around you because they already took your money.

We made reservations and thought it would be a good experience since it was their 3rd day of the Valentine's Day dinner and also because they had a set menu, in theory making it more efficient.

This was not the case. First they had two entrances to the check in desk meaning people that had been waiting in an established line for 15-20 minutes, just to check in, were getting cut off by people just arriving. The staff was not able to check people in, take them to their seats and manage the flow of traffic because there were just two of them running the desk.

Once we were seated, we had no cups, no silverware and it took a solid 15 minutes to get our preordered soup and salad. It was another 10ish minutes after the soup and salad came that we finally got silverware and cups. Between finishing soups and salad and receiving our main course, it was nearly 1.5 hours and the grilled veggies were incredibly cold. The Mahi Mahi was ok, but the steak may as well have been jerky, no exaggeration, it was difficult to cut with a knife. We had seen the wait times and sent our desert ticket in with our main course so thankfully that came out promptly but others around us were waiting at least 15 minutes to get their desert.

All of this would have been more understandable if it had been a full menu and if it was busier but it was a very limited, preselected menu and honestly, not very busy considering it was valentines day. I counted 26 tables plus bar seating and some of the tables were even empty. When wait staff would come out to the dining area, everyone's attention would shift to them in hopes of catching their attention.

I would not attend or recommend attending any sort of dining event here to anyone. There are some very clear organization issues that the customers as well as the waiters/waitresses are paying the price for. It was incredibly frustrating to experience for a special occasion. The only silver lining was our waitress had some funny jokes even though she was clearly frustrated herself.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoc2FYU1BREAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,1.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBBBCbVueorh84S46E2h2xHKlAI5n0I6mIXxHW=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"Amazing atmosphere! If you enjoy imagination, art, storytelling, fantasy, games, or just admiring creativity and craftsmanship then you will love this park. And obviously, if you love D&D or cosplay or being in character then you'll be in heaven. You can just walk around and admire the buildings and incredible detail or you can play along and go on quests and solve mysteries and get to know the park's creative storyline. There are also fun activities like ax throwing and archery as well as taverns and concessions. There are all sorts of actors and shows and demonstrations that add variety to your visit. This is a fantastic place for kids! It's fun to see their imagination and wonder get sparked. There are some places during the Lore (autumn) season that are too scary for kids but the actors in the park (the employees) are very helpful to point out where to go. We want to go back without kids to do the quests but it was very fun with kids. A fair amount of the park is under construction so it will be fun to see it when it is finished.

"This park is wonderful!! The experience is very one of a kind! The food is great reasonably priced.(except the drinks). The shows are a blast. Very worth the $15. Tip for newcomers

1. make sure you get a map! It has important tips and details on it with fun activities you can do on it such as a gnome hunt.

2. Join a guild! They give you fun tasks like sneak behind a cast member or learn types of magic (cast members have a glowing amulet)

3.Play the games they will give you a punchcard if you fill it you get a prize

4. Purchase fries or mojo onions. Not only are they delicious, but the newspaper they come with gives adventures and questions you can ask the cast members

Negative things but could improve in the future.

A. Some of the cast is not dressed up (operations mainly) I feel it would be more ingraining if they all are dressed even simply but it can be expensive so understandable

B. parts of the park are still under construction looking forward to that.

Finally me and my wife loved it so much we hope it stays afloat even in this trying time here’s some thoughts that could help

1. Volunteer/intern cast could save money

2. Since the park doesn’t open till 6 (right now) you could set up photo times before: bridals, senior, family it’s beautiful and would be perfect to sell it and make extra cash.

"The park is very nicely decorated and the employees don’t break character. HOWEVER!! The food lines are LONG and within an hour of opening they were out of bread bowls, Mac and cheese, goblin goulash and they didn’t even let the people in line know so we would all wait 30+ minutes to be disappointed. We ordered a soda and they said it would take 10 minutes to even get it (how is that even possible when they can just fill it right there and then !!?!) please staff your food areas better. Another huuuge disappointment was waiting another 30 minutes for the 10 pm showing of the aviary show and then the employee came out after there was a huuuuge line of people waiting for 30 minutes saying that there wasn’t a 10 pm show when the sign CLEARLY said there was!! The employees literally let us wait for 30 minutes outside in the cold to tell us there was no show when they could see us out there waiting while they were cleaning up! PLEASE TELL US WHEN THE SHOWS AREN’T HAPPENING SO WE DONT HAVE TO WAIT FOR NOTHING. PLEASE PUT UP SIGNS SAYING WHAT FOODS ARE OUT SO WE ARE NOT WAITING FOR LONG.

2022 UPDATE
My previous review rated this place a 2 but I’ve changed it to 1 star. It’s unfortunate how unprepared the park is. It could be amazing but being out of food and drinks within an hour of opening is not great(even on opening Lore weekend). Additionally, having the train be out of order sucked but the nice employees at the dueling arena allowed us to exchange the train combo portion for the fake swords so we could duel . It was opening week for Lore and I wanted to give this place a second chance after my horrible first experience but it greatly disappointed us once again. There were many people who don’t know what to do, I suggest that you have the employees instruct people of what they can do, it would help so much. Furthermore, most of the employees seemed to be extremely bored with their jobs which doesn’t really help with the experience. (except the animal show people, they really rocked!). I think that the only good parts about the park are the knife throwing, archery, and dueling arena (but still not the best ever). Overall I don’t think I will give this place a third chance unless they really improve. I really wish things were different, this park could be such an amazing place.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwcDh2T21RRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,1.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtPeWjJQPIzs7dxZVAVur2mwGI9akMAaQIzH6x=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"This place is epic.  When you first step into the park you're welcomed Disney-style by cast members hoping to share their story and complain about the mystery that has ""befallen the land"".  As you move from area to area interacting with characters (usually about 30-40+ each night) you find out more about this mystery.  Eventually, you realize that everything might not be as it seems and there are actually multiple mysteries and many different storylines to enjoy.  There are multiple levels of story that can be enjoyed by the first-timer, the introvert, extrovert, or the seasoned park-goer.  Come to socialize, to observe, enjoy the pretty lights and music, or to practice archery and axe throwing.  This place is truly loved by my 10-year-old boy, my teenage girls, and their grandparents.  My wife and I have taken some date nights here and didn't even tell the kids we went (or we'd be in trouble).  I am not into D&D and I hate dressing up for Halloween (sad, but true).  I'm a shorts and T-shirt kind of guy.  I still enjoy coming here again and again and playing along with the story and meeting new characters. Many people do dress up so if you're into that, you won't feel out of place.  While we don't dress up we still feel like we belong. Think of this as a ""live theater"" performance where you step onto the stage and the acting takes place close around you.   In the past, we've had season passes for Disneyland and have spent time in Disney World.  We also have had season passes for our local theater and love to attend.  I have to admit, the acting here is superb and a 10 out of 10!  I have been in situations where the tension could be ""cut with a knife"" and other situations where I've cried with the characters.  If you plan a trip, I'd recommend attending more than one evening.  You won't regret it.  The entrance fee is very reasonable (less per hour than a movie ticket) and the food there is well-priced and amazing (changes each season).  Make sure you arrive 15 minutes before they open and plan to stay until closing time.  Wear comfortable shoes. You don't have to walk a ton if you don't want to and I've seen people in wheelchairs and electric scooters....  but if you do enjoy walking and you get into the story, expect to get your steps in for the day!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvNVpIRTlnRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,5.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_SXncuZhsWLiTnTiO5lSWV6K1bwMt0JI3runO=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"My family and I had a great time at Evermore! The park had so many interesting details to discover and the characters were fun to interact with. Our 3-year-old couldn't get enough! It seemed like there were lots of random ""interactions"" happening.

"Evermore is an MMORPG video game brought to life. Within Evermore, you meet its citizens, learn about their history and struggles and complete tasks for them while exploring their world. For the muggles out there, think of it as an elaborate scavenger hunt.

The actors are what make this park happen. Throughout Evermore you'll find citizens who are either quest givers or general NPCs with helpful info. Most of them are great at what they do and play off of anything you say quite well. There are four guilds you can join and each have tasks for you to complete as initiation. We joined the Dragon Trainers after finding the elf rangers to be too snooty (and also not the best actors). I loved the actor who led the Dragon Trainers. He had a huge history of dragons in his repertoire and was just cheerful and believable. I honestly felt honored when he initiated us. It truly felt like I was playing WoW. We had quests that led to other quests that led to other quests. Some were for the overarching story and others were simple tasks like selling a magic item for a merchant. Some NPCs sat around telling ghost stories, acting out tales or singing songs.

There were a few cons, but all are things that are easy to improve and will hopefully be fixed soon. Firstly, the park itself is not complete and they do nothing to hide this. During the night this is fine because the darkness and choice lighting hide all the under construction parts. During the day, you can clearly see metal conduit, wood piles, orange safety cones, rebar, etc. piled in certain areas of the park. They do nothing to hide this and it kills the immersion. There's also little things they could easily hide like in the mausoleum there was a speaker you could clearly see that was generating monster sounds, in the aviary there was a giant A/C unit and in the middle of the field is an electrical box.

We attended on a Monday night early in the Lore season and it feels like they aren't at 100% yet. It was open 6-10 pm. We arrived just after 6 and clearly they weren't ready. We didn't receive a map when we entered or any instruction. We wandered around and saw employees/actors not yet on their game or ready to interact. This is where we were able to focus on all the poor immersion areas because we basically wandered aimlessly the first hour. However, even after dark when everyone was in place and quests began rolling, there were still huge areas with no NPCs or quest givers.

When we finally did track down a map, we saw on the back a huge task list of things to do and next to it it said, ""your first quest!"" We spent a lot of time completing these tasks only to turn it in in the end and learn the ""first quest"" was a smaller thing hidden in the image on the page and all the tasks we completed were ""just a scavenger hunt"" with apparently no reward. I think there was just a miscommunication somewhere with this but it was a bummer.

Another improvement that could be made is better marking for who is an NPC/citizen of Evermore versus players. They encourage guests to come in costume and many of us who attended were but that made it difficult for me to know ""is that elf over there someone I can talk to or another player like me?"" The quest givers wear a glowing light necklace which is great but the tavern dwellers and fairies and monsters do not.

Overall, I had a blast and LOVE this concept. I think they are working towards an app or some system to track your progress as a player and that would be really awesome!

I would recommend Evermore but not going out of your way for it. I don't think you should buy a plane ticket to SLC drive the hour to Pleasant Grove and get a hotel to attend, but it's worth a day drive or is definitely something to do if you're visiting Utah anyway.

I'm very curious to see how far the park will come in two years.

Really Cool Theme Park. My kids who are 6 & 9 loved it. They enjoyed going around and getting the little quests to do. I wish the characters were a little more forthcoming with answers or what to do. The Characters did great though at there parts. Very well done. We went on a Saturday night and the later and busier it got the lines to talk to people were annoying.

"The best part about Evermore is that it is as fun as you make it! If you are willing to interact with the characters, and are ""quest-driven"" enough to find answers then you really do become immersed.

"I was underwhelmed by my first visit, but I plan on giving them another shot.
I went oct 9th 2020.
The good:
The battle arena was lots of fun. It's the best thing there.
Archery was really cool. I wish the range was bigger so more people could shoot.  The wait to try archery is long. Like 30-45 minutes long.
My wife loved the hats and stuffed dragons.
Axe throwing looked neat but only two people could try at a time so the line was even longer than the line for archery.
We entered a large circus tent and saw a really fun show. Fire eaters, magic tricks, and gymnastics were all great to see.
There was a dragon skeleton.
The bad:
Long waits for most activities.
Some buildings were under construction and landscaping was a mess in some areas.
Questing for the various guilds could use a lot of improvement. Most of the entry level quests just don't sound fun. They will tell you some vague thing like ""learn a secret"", ""gain someone's trust"", or ""learn three people's names"". I wish the tasks were more fun. Why not find a monster? Fight somebody? Climb something? None of the quests sounded fun except for archery, and after I waited a long time in line to do that they closed down the range for a tournament right before it was my turn to go. Super disappointing.
Half the park was taken up by their haunted maze. It looked fun, but it was sold out for the night.
I'll probably go again in the winter or summer and just spend the whole day in the arena.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNDQtQ2x3RRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,3.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMexSyMXoAPcRiDDHjL4LpdTMCgDJJus_GOWst=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity
"Some advice before I go to the review: go in expecting to talk to people, that's where this park shines - their actors. Everyone is friendly, and willing to help you build your own adventure. Talk to them, ask for quests to get gold, find out what factions they belong to, and explore the story. It's a nice park, by itself, but it's amazing when you start working with the actors.

We went for the Mythos Portal (which is the summer story), there are different portals open for different seasons, and it changes the story and the atmosphere when you go.

The park itself is very well kept (especially considering it's still under construction at the time I wrote this review). The buildings are gorgeous, there are beautiful statues, and it's just generally a fun town.

The only food we tried was the hot chocolate, which wasn't anything to write home about, but they did have some nachos and other food.

The biggest downside is the lines. Waiting to talk to some actors gets kind of difficult.

The actors are what makes this park shine. People dressed up in costume who know their parts. Goblins, Dwarves, Elves, Humans, Knights, Hunters, Rangers, Faeries, so many different people with interesting stories when you start talking to them. This is what will make or break your trip, is if you're willing to start talking to them and get into the roleplaying and the story of the park. If you start playing your own character the actors will join in and make you feel comfortable.

People come dressed up in costume, and it's fun if you do. If you are in the park, you can identify the actors by their usage of a glowing amulet that every actor wears.

You can dance to bagpipes with Faeries, throw axes with the hunters, go on a noble quest for the knights, meet some dragons (done with some awesome puppeteering). It's all in all a fun time, and you'll have a great time if you make it that way.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0cU9PemhBRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,5.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzUYNSXVnvCBGZwh5IR4QSkVmgHIIcDyRx4o9h=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

Everyone was warm and friendly (unless their characters weren't). They presented quests, and help pull you into the world. You learned about these people and these stories, and could interact with the characters, and they held solid and true. I would take over conversations (As Finnius Feyweather.. Irish accent lol) and I would ask for stories, or ask for information, or ask for a song, and they never let me down, or broke character.

The musical dwarves, and wondering minstrel are must sees! They turned everything up to 11! The animal show was fun, and I even learned a few things! The park changes a few times a year, and I'm from Oregon and definitely plan on making a weekend trip down to see each one!

"We ended up going to Evermore Park tonight and although it was not completely finished it was a great experience! The details are extraordinary and talking to the characters provides insight into the story of Evermore without giving too much away.

My kids had a blast running in between characters sending messages going on quests and collecting items. It was amazing to see them in an immersive environment and being part of a theatrical experience.

The character spent time with my kids and showed interest in learning about them and the characters that they had created for their cosplay. Further they helped them to feel as if they were part of the experience. Where else can you spend time with characters and have them remember who you are at the end of the night? This doesn't happen but at Evermore it did. It was so cool to have 5 6 7 or even 8 characters talking to my kids and myself at one time! It was extraordinary!

Justin the manager was an amazing man and went out of his way to make the night special for my son who is celebrating his birthday! When this park is completed, it is my opinion that it will rival Disney and be destination for people all over North America not just Utah.

This park is not just for dress up and taking part in a cool Theatre experience but is also an educational opportunity for students and adults. Learning about the animals, the gardens, the mythology and various historical aspects of the park is fascinating. The characters use dialogue that is rich with vocabulary and the actors take the time to teach the meaning of the words to the young people that are there. My kids walked away having learned new words and their meanings. This is a fun and educational place and I cannot wait to see how the educational Outreach programs develop! As an educator myself, I would love to partner with Evermore and help them develop these programs!

I was astounded by the details of this park and cannot wait for it to be complete! It is hard to understand what is going on at first but if you are open and talk to the characters and listen to what they're saying and ask questions- you will have a delightful time. I highly recommend that everyone give this Park a shot.

If you are a perfectionist you may want to wait until the park is officially open before you attend.

"Evermore Park is foremostly a labor of love. As a park visitor, I see so much effort having gone into it: the attention to detail in the decorations, the sheer amount of money it must cost to build the park, the idea that they change the park seasonally. It fills a niche in theme park experiences, as it is a targeted to people who enjoy RPG/LARPing, although it is still accessible to much more casual park-goers.

My visit was with the guy I’d been dating for a few months. We arrived about 5m after 6pm on a Saturday. We waited in line for 35m for entry. Evermorians wandered back and forth along the line, handing out the daily newspaper. It mentioned a “darkblood” disease that had been affecting the park; a wedding announcement for a couple named Ben and Ophelia; an obituary for an elf who had been found dead in the forest. Other ads and placements are in the one-sheet periodical, too. Come to find out, our wait was because of security. The Park checked each and every bag and pocket individually.

Once in the park, we saw a giant plaza under construction. There was a steep-roofed cottage selling desserts to the right, and an Elven Ranger greeted us, recruiting for his guild. We wanted food, so stood in line for another 20m. I got mac n cheese with chili and my date got pulled pork poutine. I’d rate our food 5/10; his poutine had too little gravy. As we waited, a small troupe did a performance in the “town square”. I couldn’t hear them well.

After eating, we wandered towards the east side of the park, past a chapel under construction, and a games field with archery and axe-throwing. It’s important to know that there were many fire pits in small sitting areas on the path. We wandered three times through the mausoleum (where there was a giant spider!) because we had to count the candelabras in it for one of my date’s quests.

The park seemed understaffed. There were many stations where you could buy meals or desserts. But, only two people at each station. Any time we wanted food, it was a 15-20m wait, and half the time they were out of things — they had no bread bowls, no gumbo. I didn’t pay attention to the number of restroom facilities, nor did I actually use them. But, as far as I could see, there was only one. They did have a special First Aid area which was easy to see and find. They had a merchandise shop, which was so-so. They had dragon eggs, shirts, postcards, horn mugs…

As to the plot of Evermore Park… it seemed like there should be an overarching storyline, but it wasn’t quite there. There were guilds recruiting people (but only four guilds? rangers, hunters, knights, dragon tamers). At about 7:45pm, my date and I were in the tavern, when the announcement went out: Ben-the-engaged-guy had died. How? Why? If there were an explanation, I didn’t catch it. There was a 9pm vigil in the town square. It was cringe-inducing. I thought someone was going to burst in on the eulogy and announce that Ben was murdered, or that Ben would reappear as a zombie. Nope. (It would have also helped if there had been a stage and mics for the actors.)

I wanted the timeline to be more on my schedule, and less on the park’s schedule… A Saturday night in Utah during October gets pretty chilly. There were fire pits aplenty, but I still was getting tired, and I felt I missed out on story because we left around 9:30. (Also, to be properly attired in October, wear a thermal base layer, grab some hand warmers and bundle up. And wear good walking shoes.)

I hear that the Evermore theme changes seasonally. I cannot imagine how much work that must be. The re-playability for the park is high; we shared a fire pit with someone who was at the park for their fourth time.

Anyway, I overall had a great experience. The best part of it was that it felt like a permanent Ren Faire: Park guests arrived in full LARP gear. I’m most excited to go back once more buildings have been completed and the storyline(s) more fleshed out.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwMjVicklREAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,4.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZ49AyQFyPXWpWjC2hJDp87b82mlT5xO0rERNx=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity
It was a lot of fun wandering through what  feels like a fantasy land and they have little quests to keep you busy. I think evermore has a lot of potential for becoming really awesome. A few things I felt they could work on is putting quests together that actually gets you somewhere with an end point instead of running it back and forth between characters for the sake of keeping you busy.

"This is a great place to go with the family or on date night for an evening. There are many ways to enjoy this park. Our family has two polar opposite ways of exploring and we all enjoy it.

One group goes full on into the ""quests"", leveling up, learning more about the story and trying to figure things out, learning more about the mysteries etc.

The other group enjoys getting to know the characters (coloring with fairies, asking about pirates, games, singing) eating, enjoying the scenery, going wherever kids want to go.

The park is fun for everybody! I'm so amazed by the characters and their commitment and development. The stories have so many layers and I can easily see how somebody could go here every evening they are open (Season passes might be a good idea). With younger kids, I tend to enjoy the animal show-which rotates animals, seeing the costumes and set, watching my kids' eyes light up, encouraging good manners, helping them in engage in conversations, watching them feel accomplished as they become a knight/hunter etc. There is something for everybody to enjoy!

TIPS:
-The Evermore Park cast/characters have a white pendant necklace that glows at night. Lots of people dress up. It helps to know who is official.
- Go to the left and go into the store for the first quest card if you want.
- Find the Traveling Story Tellers. Listen to multiple stories. It really helps to put some context in to what you're seeing and doing.
- Violet- the character with the parasol- is really easy to talk to and knows what's going on. She is often toward the front gates at opening of you need some context and direction.
- The park has a few themes/seasons.

"I want to love it BUT the park still has a lot of room to improve. The line to get in was unnecessarily long for having bought tickets and signed the waiver online. We waited 55 minutes before even getting inside. They needed more people at the entrance.
And no one let you know what to do once you were inside. I had watched some YouTube videos before hand and thought we were given character cards and an intro quest but after the long wait all we got was a map. So we started just by walking around aimlessly and exploring. It wasnt til 30 minutes later we realized the intro quest was on the back of the map! Would have been nice if the employee who gave us the map had told us that! And no one told us how to distinguish park employees from guests. (Because some guests had really elaborate costumes...) We figured out over time it was the people with green pendants.
But the BIG disappointment was after completing the first quest we went to the kettle cafe and turned in our gold to level up! The next quest we assumed would be something different but they simply handed us the same quest again and said they would have different ones in the future. They did say that there were quests to join each guild but it just felt like there was no reward or sense of accomplishment for that first quest. And the guild we wanted to join (the dragon trainers) we were told were ""sick"" or infected and were currently hold up in a building that was boarded up. So not sure if that meant we were supposed to find a way in side as part of the game or that the employees were just not working that night. We didnt stay to find out. We soon left after that after about 2 hrs.
But as I said I want to love it. The park did have a few things going for it:
The decorations and details were really awesome.
The actors characters seemed really cool and the ones we interacted with were nice and did a good job.
I would have loved if there was more to do. Bottom line all the quests (at least the ones available) seemed to be go somewhere talk to someone. And alot of the time the actors were surrounded by other guests so you had to wait to talk to them. The main areas to interact were crowded.
For the cost price I dont think it is worth it... Yet. I think they need some more actual attractions. It felt kinda empty. If you absolutely love DnD you could probably go spend 5 hours there and enjoy it completely. But if you prefer solo RPG videogames I'd say spend the money on those instead. For me and my wife it cost $64 bucks and now I kinda wish I had just bought a new videogame lol.

"Evermore park is a great theme park based on performance and costumes. As well as a park with a unique, ominous, fantasy atmosphere. Though it was not quite complete when I attended (opening night celebration) as several buildings were fenced off or still under construction, it has immense promise. The main appeal to me wasn't the gorgeous hand chiseled decorations, imported 400 year old statues, live instrument music, fantasy taverns filled with druids and fawns, or the dark gothic feel. But rather the inadvertant way the park enables everyone to show up as themselves. Free of judgment, and equally included. Regardless of their appearence or uniqueness.

"OVERVIEW - 4.8
Came here as a work activity.  We were enticed by how elusive the place is on details, let alone online.  We actually ended up looking at Evermore's social media to get a better understanding.

LOCATION - 5
Ever more is located in Pleasant Grove not too far the freeway and other surrounding businesses such as Essential Oils.  I had to use a GPS to find the location and then parking was a little confusing (I parked in the back thinking it was the front.)

PRICE - 4
Pricing was a little steep for my liking, but it was worth the experience.  My daughter had just turned 6 and so I had to pay for her, whereas if she was 5 or under she would have been free....  If I had to name the prices, I would set $15 at the perfect price for adults.

PRODUCT/SERVICES - 5
This is where this place excels!  The attention to detail was remarkable!  I was impressed by the Evermore cast.  They played their roles rather well.  I enjoyed the various roles they had as well such as the Druids, which were both serious and kind, the executioner was rather intimidating, the fairies were enlightening, the dragon trainer was so kind to my daughter.  If you have a chance to meet her do it!  She was awesome with my daughter.  I was even convinced that dragons were real after talking to her.

POINTERS/PERKS - 5
The objective of Evermore other than walking around and enjoying the detail is to interact with the cast.  Talk to them, go on quests.  They will give you tiny missions if you ask what you can do for them.  Keep in mind as the night progresses (especially near Halloween), that details and new quests can change.  Another trick I learned is sometimes you can listen in on someone else completing a quest, and then you come by a few minutes with the same details...  I would also recommend that if you have a poor memory like me, you may want to have something to jot down details such as a small notebook or your phone.  That's another detail, you may want to have a phone in case you get separated from your party as it is very likely.

If you complete a certain amount of quests you can become honor positions.  Such as a co-worker and his girlfriend both became honorary knights.

EMPLOYEES - 5
This is where they excel!  They stay in character the whole time.  Their details to their lives is amazing.  I also love it when characters interact with one another.

Evermore is an immersive experience akin to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Universal Studios), Fantasyland (Disney), and Ghost Town (Knott's Berry Farm). There are a lot of characters to interact with, but no thrill rides. (There was a train ride, but it broke own the day we went, possibly due to weather.) It's definitely something you'll want hours to explore. I recommend getting the park map when you get there and seeing what is going on.

It was a lot of fun once we got settled in. But they do a pretty bad job of preparing new guests for the experience, so the first 10-15 minutes we're really stressful for us. Make sure you have plenty of time before any scheduled events.

We checked in at the front gate and had to work out what to do to get refunded on our train tickets. We had bought the additional Christmas Carol experience and they hadn't given us any information at the gate on how to redeem it. Luckily, we found someone else doing the Christmas Carol experience who told us where and how to redeem our tickets. Unfortunately, we ended up missing the beginning of the performance because of how long it took us to figure out what was going on.

We had about 30 people attend our Christmas Carol performance, which was probably the most it could handle. It was definitely hard for everyone to get the full experience. Additionally, someone had a double wide stroller, which slowed the group down a couple of times because of really narrow doorways and the uneven/poorly-lit pathways. It would have been fine, but the actors weren't trained on how to help someone with a stroller/wheelchair. It seemed pretty ADA and handicap accessible.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTMWQ2Wll3EAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,4.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIKOQZr6ZpqXxvh8y5JWWhoXezU_Aej29sE_Mk=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"I want to be super clear: I love Evermore. I've gone 3 times now and had a great time every time, except for this last one during Lore 2021.

The Haunt was a fun idea, except the time we reserved to go through it didn't matter at all. We spent an hour waiting in line to go in, far and away after our reserved time. Well, we thought, at least we get to go to the second haunt, maybe that one won't be as busy! Nope. We spent more time in line, then the second haunt that we paid for was the EXACT SAME haunt again, with a slightly different ""quest"". The quest was different by about 2 or 3 different lines in the script from the actors (who were wonderful, as always, but still). We were very disappointed with the haunt experience.

We also got combo tickets which included food vouchers. Guess what we did? Waited in line another 45 minutes for sub-par food. I think I saw about 2 people in the back making the food for hundreds of patrons. (Absolutely not the workers' fault!) Evermore is simply not equipped to handle this many people.

Perhaps if they limited the number of patrons in the park, so there are less people in general, it would help? I would happily pay more to enter if I knew I wouldn't spend literally 1/2 the time I spent there in lines. It's either that or bump up staffing to accommodate all of the people there.

I love love love Evermore with all my heart, and I so badly want them to succeed, but I wish some of the energy they put into their spectacular sets and costumes and actors also went towards straight up logistics. Even the bathroom situation is lacking. Only three stalls in the women's bathroom? No wonder there is always a line going around the building.

They tried something new, which is commendable! But in practice, it clearly wasn't the experience that was marketed to us.

I'm hoping that for the Winter theme they'll have learned a few things from the what they tried with Lore. I have every confidence that they'll try to improve the experience for their guests who love them and want them to succeed! And I'm looking forward to hopefully coming back to edit this review after we visit in the winter.

"We had so much fun exploring the park and doing a couple quests! We were only there for about two hours. We brought our 4 year old daughter and she absolutely LOVED all the characters and how so many people were dressed up! She made me promise she could dress up as a fairy or pirate next time we go.

We did find starting out to be a bit difficult with the acorn quest from the fairy, but after asking for a hint we were finally able to find our first one and know what we were looking for! Finding the rest was MUCH easier after finding the first one! Everyone was so nice and it was so cool! I loved seeing all the other visitors fully enjoying themselves in full cosplay! Luckily there were enough people not in cosplay that we didn't feel awkward or stick out. I'm not talented enough to put together such wonderful costumes.

If you happen to be in a wheelchair or a knee scooter (I was on a knee scooter) there are a lot of cobblestone areas and one area that is a little bit of looser gravel, so be prepared for some bumpy areas! Totally manageable, but obviously is a bit harder than just walking. Definitely looking forward to a trip without the knee scooter! Hahah

There were many people there, and the atmosphere I would have to describe as: Happy. People just all having an amazing time.

It was better than Disneyland ever was.

My father took the route of being a Knight of the realm. While I was a liar and a thief. We walked together, and sometimes would need to split to do different things. We would txt each other information of things that we would find out and where to meet up. My sisters and mom became princesses, and went shopping. Local vendors are at Evermore btw.

"Point 1: DO NOT COME IN SUMMER IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF SPIDERS. They are EVERYWHERE! Big too! Since Evermore opens in the evenings all the spiders are LITERALLY DROPPING FROM ALL THE TREES AND AWNINGS EVERYWHERE. We literally couldn't stay after that. I don't care if they aren't dangerous--pathological fears don't care.

Point 2: After coming every year I am officially over the fact that the park isn't even finished. While individual buildings are cool and fleshed out, the grounds are just...boring. There's lots of dirt, unfinished buildings, and broken set pieces. Even the magnificent statue in the fountain the park was famous for is falling apart. I have never seen the fountain actually going. It's all just...disappointing.

Point 3: There is no consistency. Not in the costumes, not in the art, not even in the lore. The Makers had this deal about not being able to be a proper guild, there are a lot of employees that don't bother acting or dressing up, and approaching the actors who are there feels like interrupting because they are often talking to each other. We didn't even know who worked there since no one told us about the necklaces until we asked. Yes, their acting was great, but there weren't enough of them and those that were there were always in a crowd of people. We didn't feel like standing in line forever to talk to someone so we moved on.

Point 4: We got a pastry from the pastry shop and while it was tasty it was hard as a rock!

Final remarks: I just can't believe that after all this time none of this stuff has been fixed. I know people come from across the U.S. to see this place.

One tip: bring a fully charged phone. Some of the quests required you to take pictures. Also, they give you a booklet when you enter the park, but they ran out of pencils.

"At Evermore you participate in an interactive, live action story. You get completely immersed in one of (currently) three stories depending on the season. In summer it is Mythos, fall is Lore, and winter is Aurora.

While the stories are different, the mechanisms are the same. You meet characters portrayed by Evermore actors. They will give you tasks or quests to be accomplished. Completing these quests allows you to ""level up"" and possibly join a guild.

Expect to spend an hour or more completing a quest, and 20-30 minutes to finish a task. That's my biggest complaint with Evermore. You should be able to complete tasks faster and get rewards more quickly.

The other problem is sometimes many people will be backed up at a particular actively or character. The best way to avoid this is to work on multiple tasks or quests simultaneously. That way if one area is busy you can work on a different task.

Many people dress up but it certainly is not required. There are quite a few people walking around in street clothes. However, if you want to dress up in themed costumes, you definitely won't be alone. Note that real weapons (swords, knives, etc.) are not allowed but plastic or wood replicas are fine.

Be sure to look for the Evermore pendant to identify characters vs. your fellow ""world walkers"" (park guests) who dressed in costume. At night the pendent is lighted so they are easy to spot.

If you're new to Evermore, the best suggestion is to talk to all the characters you meet (even just walking around) & ask lots of questions. While the actors will remain in character, they will answer questions and help you enjoy your experience.

Pro tips:
1. Buy tickets online for a slight discount & generally faster entry
2. Bring a hat, sunglasses, & sunscreen

"I think this place has a lot of potential, and I understand it's still under construction. It's not catered to crowds so probably don't go on a weekend for a better experience. I definitely would say it's a fun family experience. I went with my husband only and felt like we got lost and pushed around by the bigger groups a lot. Dress warm because it's outdoors. You enter a story. It's kind of like a village and you walk around visiting places, talking with actors. You usually end up having to do them a favor in exchange for information or gold.

The good: The actors were great! Especially Flutterheart, the knight with a teapot hat, and Drock the goblin. The buildings were cool too! Cool creepy spider monster jumps out at you .. Loved those sorts of things. Loved how everything was themed. I was even impressed with the bathrooms and drinking fountain 👏 I could see the kids having fun, getting candy and anti-hexing leafs from the fairies to trade for gold, and we were dubbed squires! That was fun. Fire show was cool. Loved the violin/performers that set the ambiance.

The bad:
Honestly, the biggest thing was that we were so confused the whole time! Especially at the beginning, and we wasted so much time getting gold to trade for information we already knew. I wish they had an opening video or something to explain some backstory, or a pamphlet describing the characters or something??? Also, it was so crowded that we had to wait so long to talk to the characters. And we waited way too long for the axe throwing just to only get two chances.  Couldn't even participate in the fortune telling and archery like I wanted because we would've waited in line way too long. This place is not catered for crowds and Saturdays are crowded, apparently. I kept thinking regular people were the actors because it's too dark to tell if they're wearing a medallion, but I can see how that fun for people to dress up.. I just felt very exhausted and like we didn't get anywhere. By 10:15pm we were too tired to continue and no where near understanding the story. I still have a black rock (no clue why I needed it because the actors kept getting distracted talking to other people, no one bothered to explain) and a piece of gold for the Fae King... The line was too long to talk to him as well. I feel left out. Just don't think it was worth $30, but understand why it's necessary to charge that much with all the people they need to pay.

In all, I do think it was fun for the most part, and a great family activity. I was just disappointed. Think they have some kinks to work out, and maybe it'll be even cooler when the rest of the park is finished. Maybe I'll return with a better review when that happens.

"Evermore is absolutely dripping with wasted potential. I am hopeful they can sort things out and make the park into something that justifies the extremely expensive entry price for what is there now. I may try again when the ""season"" changes for Christmas.

Everything from getting into the park to the way the ""experience"" is presented just feels unpolished, which is probably a metaphor for the fact that various really interesting looking aspects of the park are still under heavy construction and blocked off.

First off, the ticketing process is underwhelming. It would be nice if the tickets were a little bit nicer as a kind of memento that you were there. They could even be themed to the season for collecting, and it would be cool to incorporate them into the story in some way as in you're a traveler who has some kind of token.

Second, there is nothing encouraging you to engage with the characters or story. Lots of people encourage you to go in with the intention of being absorbed into the world and experiencing it like a video game. The problem is, there is no introduction to the world or back story to why you showed up like you would get in Skyrim or other RPGs. You basically just have to chat with random cast members who are obviously trained to respond to very specific trigger words that you can't really guess and the cast gives you no encouragement of what types of questions you should ask. So most conversations are the cast member trying to repeat themselves in a way that sounds like they are answering your questions but mostly just leave you confused. The park really should do more to draw you in, and encourage you to be drawn in. Without that, the ticket price feels like a waste of money and that's the experience of most visitors.

Third, the place is just insanely crowded. That means random conversations with cast members force people to either hang around overhearing what is going on, or stand around in big clumps waiting for their chance to talk to an important character. The park needs to figure out how to work around large groups of people rather than just one on one conversations.

Lastly, there is just a ton of immersion breaking material around the park. Mainly chain link fences and construction equipment. While the park is open they really should figure out a better way to mask these things because it does affect the overall atmosphere of the park to see big cranes and tractors just sitting around the outskirts of town.

Overall I can see what the park is going for, but it's still quite far from reaching it. Hopefully with a little more time to bake they can get there.

"This is a very unique place. It has a lot of potential. I can see it growing to be really popular. I write my experience with the hopes that improvements can be made to really enhance the place.

The park vibe:
Very cool idea. It did feel like we were in a whole different world. Sadly I could still see some things under construction which I wish was covered up like Disney does it. But I also understand the new business budget can’t afford that much. So not a big deal. I loved the characters walking around and being interactive. They were a lot of fun. At night the lightning is eery and fun. It would be kinda scary for young kids though. And it would be easy to loose a child in that lighting.

The costumes:
Very high quality costumes the employees wear. But also, many guests of the park wear costumes too. Which is fun but kinda difficult to tell who is an employee and who isn’t. I wished the employees had glowing name tags so I could know who to ask for directions and stuff from. It would be awkward to ask another guest for help.

The food:
I LOVED the sandwhich I ordered. Very yummy! The monte Cristo at the dessert shop was very oily though and I wished it had been cooked in an air fryer instead. I also wish the menu had pictures. It’s a lot easier for me to order things that I can see.

The magic show:
The beginning was really boring. Your typical magic tricks that you see. Was not a fan of the “word” trick because there was no magic to it. He never even said what the word was. Maybe that was a distraction for his next trick but I didn’t like it. The last trick was awesome! One of my all time favorite tricks to watch. Very impressed with that. Giving his act more of a WOW the entire time would really make this place have more credibility. Go all out!

The train:
We loved the train. Super fun to see the whole town and go around the train. Fun for kids and fun for us. Just a short little ride.

The map:
I like the graphics of the map. That is user friendly. But the magician tent and stuff isn’t on it. And all the locations seem to be in the mythical words and make it not user friendly at all. I had no idea what there was to do and where it was. Many people around me were confused too. I wish we were given a map when we entered and I wish there were big maps around the park. I just need it to say the different places and what there is to do and explore at each one.

Getting Lost:
Aside from what I already talked about with the map, I wished each location had a solid sign of what it was right on the building or tent. I wasn’t sure what buildings we could and couldn’t go in. I need more than a chalkboard in front of the magician tent that says...
“magic show” and then a sign at eye level with the times of the shows. I arrived at 6:00 and the sign said magic show every half hour. But they didn’t open till 7:00 so at 6:30 I was confused why nobody was there.

Haunted House:
Sadly I had to work and leave early so we were not able to experience the highlight of the park. Next time I’ll give you some info on that.

Website:
The website for sure needs help. It needs to be more simple in layout and show what’s in the packages and what there is to do better. I needed everything disclosed. I kept reading about some sort of circus and when I asked some of the employees about it they said they were the circus.. I expected a circus show with animals and tricks. Not just characters walking around. Maybe it was a misunderstanding on my end but yeah really confusing. There is also a bird show that looks pretty cool from online but I wasn’t able to go to that either because I had to leave early for an important work zoom call.

I wish there was a restroom on the north side of the park too.

I also think it would be AWESOME to have a costume shop! Also little kiosks around selling hot coacoa, hand warmers, and fun merch.

Don’t let the 2 starts fool you. This place has the potential to be incredible. Just a few tweaks will make a big difference.

"Holy cow! I mean, this place blew me away. I went thinking it might be a little odd, but was looking for a Halloween activity to do, and this place completely blew away my expectations. It's got so many activities (axe throwing, knife throwing, archery, fortune telling, magician show, animal show, etc.). I don't even know if I hit everything.

"Four of us from Honolulu, Hawaii played this course on September 26, 2016 and we absolutely enjoyed the round.  Great staff, course and surroundings. Had previously called Bob to inquire about the course due to the mixed reviews.  Wildwood GC provides exceptional value and we put this course on our play again course whenever we're up here in the Portland area. Our foursome consisted of three Waialae Country Club and one Mid-Pacific Country Club members.  Mahalo Bob for taking great care of us.

Returned to play with some other buddies on May 6, 2017 before heading back to Honolulu the next day after a  five day golfing tour in the greater Portland area.  They were impressed Wildwood is on their ""will play again"" list.  Thanks Tom and the rest of the staff for taking care of us and welcoming us back.  Will be back up there in early-October with the original 2016 Honolulu guys!

"Just played here on Sunday 10/6, about three weeks post-punching. The greens are fantastic. They're rolling very smooth and true..and at a great speed. They're firm, yet they're holding shots the way they should. Also, the traps were all hand raked, and fairways were very playable.

Look for a new expanded green complex and new lower tee on the par three # 6, and new tee locations on # 7. One thing that always impresses me about Wildwood, is the attention to detail, and the constant reinvestment in the course and clubhouse.

Also, the service is always friendly and accommodating. If you've never played Wildwood, be sure to give it a try. It's a real hidden gem of a golf course, with plenty of interesting holes, lots of character and challenges, and spectacular views.

"Challenging holes are carved out of the hillside along the river at this course to provide something for everyone. First and foremost there is more vertical change at this course than many I have played in the past. Some pin locations are a hundred feet above the tee box while others are the same downhill. This makes it almost a must to rent a cart if you are playing 18, unless you are in peak physical condition.

The clubhouse is big and clean with friendly staff members to help out with your needs. The range is quite short and narrow, only 200 yards max by about 20 yards wide which makes it hard to warm up for the long shots you will need to be successfull right off the first tee. The carts are older and gas powered which made it tricky to get up some if the steep hills and there is some slow play if you are behind the wrong group.

Insider tip: make sure to study the course before you go if you haven't played here. There are hidden creeks and obstacles that ruin great shots down the middle. Better yet, play a practice round so you'll be ready before taking it on!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJemVqU21nRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wildwood+Golf+Course/@45.6802797,-124.0292931,9z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x54950078a06c4d17:0x288db95b2eead252?hl=en",ChIJF01soHgAlVQRUtLqLlu5jSg,Golf course,4.0,Wildwood Golf Course,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5aj-3n9YAyHw7Z9i1tmJxjaBuiKpZ21CZBGqb=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

Looks like a well maintained​ golf course. It has a nice clubhouse and OK RV park for peaple traveling. I'm not a golfer but I stayed at the RV park.  I saw how well they kept up the golf course.  I stayed in the RV park for two months.  They did not seem good at managing the RV park and at times the management didn't know who was even there.  At times they didn't even dump the trash cans. They sometimes went days without doing this and only dumped them oafter they started overflowing. The golf course was well kept but there was lots of weeds around the RV spaces.  Electrical is included but daily space rates seem high for what they have to offer. This was NOT a dog friendly RV park. They have very poor WiFi service.

A great little gem in Buffalo! A very challenging course for all abilities. Greens were fast and in great shape. Fairways were clean and rolled true. Great customer service.

The main building is not super big but it has many interesting exhibitions and information, this is definitely the first stop; but then you have a beautiful farm (outdoor) with an old cabins and many other stations and animals that your kids will love.
In addition to it you can also walk-hike trough a small forrest that is also beautiful and a perfect opportunity to enjoy nature. There is a lot to do 👍

"This was such a cool place to learn about so many different things. Local history, habitats, and animals beginning in the Prehistoric Era. Informative and well maintained exhibits.

The planetarium show was really interesting to watch about the Artemis Mission.

Outside there is a wonderful shady trail that it a half mile that circles the property. There are really awesome exhibits outside as well as a play area for the kids, a pond, an old mill, a stone age heritage site and a Catawba Indian Village.

There is also a small farm that you can enjoy with live animals. The cost to enter is $3/pp but we ran out of time today.

"The museum had some really nice exhibits an dinosaurs, and 'Creepy Nature' as well as a good permanent exhibit area.  The 'farm' area was a little disappointing, but that was probably due to it being November.   There were no staff around to answer questions or monitor the area that we could see.
The planetarium was small, but did a neat little show on the night sky.  Some of the non-sky images were blurry, and the show was definitely geared toward a younger audience than my just turned teenager, but we still enjoyed it.

Live animal exhibits were WAY too small for said animals and the care was very dissapointing. As someone who does reptile rehabilitation it was really sad seeing resident animals live in such conditions.  most of the taxidermy pieces in this museum also need to be revived.

"I stopped to visit the museum while I was in the area. It has many exhibits that are typical of a natural history museum such as dinosaurs, minerals/rocks, eco system displays, birds, bugs, and other animals. It had an American Indian section and a specific North Carolina area which I thought were neat. There were also live animals in some places and I wasnt expecting that. The creepy house and exhibition was very interesting to me because it was based on a real person's experience finding out what was true or false in nature.

"This is pretty cool place. I have 3 boys between the ages of 2-8 yrs old. The dinosaur exhibits were nice, with sounds and short films. The children's hands on vet/archiology clinic was super cool. The pirate ship was fun. We didn't get to do the planetarium because.. let's face it. My 2 year old wouldn't sit through it. They have small live animals to check out too like a possum, snakes, parie dog and turtles. On the back side of the building there's pigs and sheeps. There's a trail with a pond and other things.

Great fun for the family. If you're local you'll want a membership for planetarium discounts. They change up the sky shows every so often. This last show we went to in April was actually boring and I fell asleep but they did the Carolina sky afterwards and it was Great! They actual museum is just the right size. They have manual wheelchairs but my mother didn't feel she needed one she used her walker and it was ok. Although we didn't travel all over it was a good little tour of the facility.

"Thanks for the great stay Hyatt Eden!!  A group of us drove from Winnipeg to Minneapolis to catch a Vikings game. We were concerned this hotel was too far away but it didn’t turn out to be an issue. It’s easy enough to drive around the city. Maybe took us half hour to get downtown. The Harley store, Target and Menards are close to the hotel so that was nice.

The rooms are big!! King Bed comfy, shower pressure great and lots of hot water!!!  Pull out sofa.
Could have easily had 4 adts share the king room.

Front staff check in was pleasant. They didn’t realize we were all traveling together so they ended up placing us on different floors. But that was our fault for not speaking up.
We also didn’t speak up about having a room away from the elevators. It was annoying to be woken up super early from guests checking out and kids running up and down the hallway etc. By the elevator. Things yah just don’t think about sometimes.

"Reserved our deluxe king room with jetted tub for Sept 19th back in mid June 2021 & requested a quiet location (if possible). They put us in room 314, which was located on 3rd of 4 floors, right outside of the elevators & across from the ice machine room (very noisy).

The bath towels were thin, rough, and worn (one had two rips on edges... see pics). Jetted tub was the best part of the room, but took forever to fill up. But, for some stupid reason there was NO vent fan in the bathroom! Horrible!

The furnishings were a bit dated & I wouldn't call the size of the king room a ""deluxe"". Reserved that room purely because I knew after a 12 hr drive I'd want to soak in a nice big bath tub. Mattress was comfy, but only 3 squishy pillows (not 4) on the king sized bed (no neck support at all).

"Ummm I probably wouldn’t come here because of the security, they were super strict, couldn’t do much but then again it’s their job, but they made us feel uncomfortable. We booked on Expedia which then brought me to Virbo and I had to create an account and the owners name is Tom. It was a little confusing but figured it out.
The apartment was very spacious and clean,to bedrooms and a set of bunk beds, it had everything you need such as laundry soap, condiments, utensils, plates etc. So we were able to grocery shop for the week.
When you go to the pool, the kiddie pool is not warm and there is an adult pool for night. The beach is beautiful but there is always a low tide so you will have to walk a little to get to the water.
The town is not fully developed, so don’t expect a Cancun experience but you will find authentic Mexican food when you drive into the town.
In the tourist area of Puerto Penasco, they sell very expensive souvenirs, charging in American prices.

"This was a great condo & beach facilities. We went on the jet ski, had piña coladas, swam in the pool, cooked breakfast in the room and slept comfortably in the bed. There were four of us on a very roomy 2 bedroom with beautiful views on the 9th floor. We didn’t get to use other amenities as we were only there for 24 hours but we will venture back. Please keep in mind the border in that area closes at 8pm SHARP from the Arizona side so get there with plenty of time for a line up. Also — watch out for sand storms in the area, we encountered one and it was a doozy that would have been very uncomfortable if we weren’t already in the taxi!

We came for 4th of July weekend and our friends booked our Airbnb here at Las Palmas I love the resort entirely! First time in Puero Penasco! So walking from the Condo to the beach was just a few mins so close by the beach. Our view was amazing & breathtaking! The resort pools we absolutely loved and enjoyed. They have the kid family pool area which is impressive cause they have really cool slides and shallow area for littles. Plus offer his eats and antojitos while swimming and lounging. The resort has zero tolerance for partying too late and loud obnoxious ppl will be addressed or kicked out so I like that too.

Nice place to stay for a drive from California to Portland.
The parking for moving trucks is awesomely abundant and easy access.

The entrance area is beautiful for a Best Western, the dining area is huge.
There are stores, a gas station and Chase bank right across the street.
There a a few restaurants around as well and plenty of places to walk your dog.

Conveniently located with only about a 20 minute drive to Mt Shasta Ski Park. They DO NOT have the traditional free breakfast, however they do have a restaurant onsite. Also have a bar and grill. Food is a little spend but good, as expected for hotel restaurants. They were short staffed but the waitresses did their best and were very polite and accommodating. We decided to stay an extra night on a holiday weekend and while booked, the manager Joe pulled through for us and got us an extension. All of the staff work hard and are very polite.

"Nice grounds an a clean room and bathroom but that's about it.  The shower in the morning was only like warm... very disappointing. The bed was old and brokendown or just incredibly soft and very uncomfortable with small very LUMPY pillows. Worst night of sleep on the trip.
The restaurant is a bit old and the furniture is pretty broken down. I sunk into my seat about 3 inches! The food was pretty disappointing too...medium steak (at over $30!) Came out cold and raw. Could not send it back because the ONE server was completely overwhelmed with tables. That said...her service and attitude considering the situation was incredible! She really tried very hard to get to everyone.
It's probably a great place to being kids...nice outdoor courtyards between the buildings and little waterfalls.  There is an indoor pool that looked pretty decent.

"Fantastic location for a short trip around Mt. Shasta.

Our first ever stay here. There are cheaper lodges too in the area but our risk appetite was limited, hence went for this one with higher security and better arrangement in terms of breakfast and room quality.

I just wish they could have provided housekeeping service too since we spent more than just one night. I remember how during pre-covid times the hotel rooms in any place used to be cleaned and well arranged each day by the time you were back. Miss that luxury!

Breakfast isn't a buffet. That also surprised me. They have a standard list of 6-7 entres and you have to choose your breakfast from it. Us being vegetarians had limited options and repeated the same thing the next day. It was, however, delicious. Lovvvedd the hot chocolate with whipped cream.

LOVE LOVE the Best Western Tree House! Will stay again!

Loved the cabin-esque feel with the high ceilings.

It was great that you could get to the lobby and restaurant all internally.

Great views of the snow capped mountains from our window.

Great prices at the restaurant but there weren't menus readily available. Nice diner to sit down to eat.

Close enough to popular attractions like Burney Falls and McCloud Falls.

Rooms with external door and kitchenette options available.

Felt safe here.

Ryan was great at check in.

Cons:
Pricey but better than all the other hotels around.

Heating/Cooling system didn't work very well.

"For a view of Mount Shasta, this place was one of the best in town. It was centrally located, within walking distance to most of the restaurants in town. The rooms itself could use some freshening up, not really outdated, just looked a little tired. Couldn't tell if the refrigerator in the room was working, didn't seem to get particularly cold and there was no adjustment. The restaurant was good but do yourself a favor and DO NOT PURCHASE THE PRE PAID BREAKFAST PACKAGE. They charge you $20 per person for breakfast. You get your choice of one entree and one drink. My wife ordered the Granola and coffee and wanted a bagel. She was told that she would have to pay extra for the bagel even though the total with the bagel wasn't over $20. You're better off paying as you go because you don't get the difference if your total is under $20. Staff was friendly and helpful. Overall, our stay was ok, I'd stay here again if I were in town but I wouldn't pre pay for breakfast again.

Just got a response from Best Western. They state that their breakfast package are $10 for adults and $5 for children. Going through Bookings.com we were charged $20 per person. Our total for breakfast for the 5 days we were there was $200. I will say breakfast was good but not $200 good. And at no time were our meals over $20 but we didn't get the difference back",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDb2ZDODNRRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Best+Western+Plus+Tree+House/@38.1399101,-128.4934264,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x54cde6d99d0d5d33:0x208cb78b1a23300e!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d41.309654!4d-122.317721!16s%2Fg%2F1wc30zmg?hl=en",ChIJM10NndnmzVQRDjAjGou3jCA,Hotel,3.0,Best Western Plus Tree House,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQH9mz7e1oWavrGjrpf_5foaQfgVHxj1dVM8iy=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

We decided to come here to have breakfast and then hang out in the Arcade. First impression coming in the elevator we’re old and dirty. Once you get inside the Casino/Hotel it looks way better. We had pancakes and eggs which were delicious but the sausage looked like it had freezer burns on it so we didn’t eat that. The staff at the restaurant were great and not too long of a wait time. The arcade was fun. A little over priced but the convenience of having it within the hotel could be a plus. We were able to make enough points to cash out for some goodies at their Arcade store.

"I've stayed here twice within the last year, the first time my room in the casino tower was a lot more run down and old than I am used to and I low key had an eerie feeling from the room I stayed in the first time. Maybe something happened there before I don't know, but I felt this odd coldness/a feeling that made me uneasy. I was hesitant to stay here but I decided to book again since I was only here for a couple days.

My 2nd visit this past week was decent. The hotel itself is older of course, but it gives the basic necessities. I was in the sky tower this time and it felt more updated than the casino tower?

Heating/cooling system worked perfectly. I had a corner room which had a nice view of the city.

I would give this rating a lot lower for the incident that happened, but I will assume it was a rare occurrence where someone walks in your room without knocking. The woman Apologized, but I felt really uncomfortable because I could've been naked or in the shower. It was totally inappropriate, I messaged the concierge Ivy person thing and they apologized but never offered to do anything...

Water quality from the faucets were questionable, I ran the hot and cold and both looked heavy, see photo. But cleared up after I ran it for some time.

Shower ran well too. Water temp was well controlled. So everything else was fine with the room. Nothing extravagant, I just got a normal king size room.

Anyways, I like the convenience of the hotels location and how it's connected to the other, Silver Legacy, el Dorado, etc. We enjoy the arcade and circus shows too. Staff are friendly for the most part. They have a better food court now than they did 12 years ago, so there are improvements here and there.

I love that they still have a lot of old mixed with new. I love the history of the buildings and seeing that throughout the halls and rooms of the buildings. Please maintain the history  I think that's what really entices visitors too!

"It's been a few years since we have stayed here and unfortunately will probably be the last time. I received an email inviting me to stay there which stated they had newly remodeled rooms, which made us want to go ahead and book here instead of our usual other option. Well, our visit was less than satisfying. We drove up Sunday afternoon to check in and were told there was no valet service - park across the street, and walk back to check in (was not allowed to keep my car in their driveway while checking in). Not a good start. Check in line had about 10 parties waiting to check in and only two front desk folks (after about 10 minutes one more front desk agent showed up). Once in the room, I was confused how they could state the rooms were remodeled(?). Bathroom was great (only one hook to hang towels), the room was painted, but the furniture was still old and scratched up, the chair was creaking with every move and the thermostat was very dirty (not huge, but very noticeable). The casino had no live tables, so we had to go somewhere else to play - I prefer to just stay in my hotel to gamble. As far as the 'Resort Fee', it lists 2 water bottles (helpful on a 100 degree day), but never got that - I called down to see if they could be brought over and never got them. There were a couple of coffee pods with a sign stating they will be refreshed every morning, they are not. I called the 2nd morning to get a couple, but ended up running to Starbucks instead (Why are they charging a resort fee???). If this covers the parking, maybe think about charging the people parking in your lot and not staying at your hotel.
In any case, with all the alternative hotels in Reno I will not be booking another room at Circus Circus. I'll keep the old memories of what they used to be years ago.

"Came on a Tuesday night. Masks only suggested for non-vaccinated guests but a surprising number of guests and staff wore one.

Check in was quick. Had a suite room. Clean, spacious, with dual temp control. Large bathroom with shower/tub. Keurig available with coffee pods. Hidden mini fridge. Extra pillows in closet.

"Goods. Room was clean, working personnel nice, friendly and helpful from front desk to security and housekeeping, has a fym/fitness center, nice location, staying here pretty much gets you access to 3 casinos with a walking distance to Reno signature sign.
Bad stuff.
LINES ! If you there on the weekend when everyone else is there well let's say this place can't handle it's own capacity. To check in long line, to get to your room at certain  times there is a (no joking) 40 minutes wait line for elevator, now  it's not always but try to get back to your room when you really need something can be frustrating time in line for elevator.
Noise, I am talking hotel room, you can hear a lot from rooms nextdoor and hallway.
Bathroom!  Now that could be subjective but bathtub is very small, shower pipes makes loud noise while waiting for hot water and sink makes loud bubbly noises after use.
That's all major points. You can have great time staying there if you do it on not busy days, but if you have regular schedule and go there when most of people do, you might get frustrated standing in 40 minutes line for elevator when you just need to go to your room little quick.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMHZXUmFnEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Circus+Circus+Reno/@38.1399101,-128.4934264,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x809947369a6d96f1:0x8a35778e09b46c3e!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.5314464!4d-119.8157093!16zL20vMDVnNTAx?hl=en",ChIJ8ZZtmjZHmYARPmy0CY53NYo,Hotel,3.0,Circus Circus Reno,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOV3RPvxn-HupPql21Uni5wTZRo1bzyu0KYFMRk=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"I haven't been to Las  Vegas but if you have limited time and you are heading to San Francisco or  bay area and if casino is in your bucket list then you definitely need to add Reno to your list. We went on Saturday night and all the casinos were filled. We stayed in circus circus, it's one of the casino among the three giants which hosts its own casino. A perfect place to stay and enjoy in a casino.
Easy check-in and check out.Rooms were good, what else one might in need of. One drawback which I thought is number of boards were very less and casinos were all filled with digital ones which seems to be slightly bothering. All the bar and restaurant were good. Even if you want to take a walk , best time is to go after 10PM . You can have a good view of the lights .
The row is all integrated and you can move between all the 3 casinos . They too have play area like arcade games for little kids . Please note children are not allowed inside the casino .  You need to have alternate arrangements for that.

"So,  we decided to wing it and drive to Stanley for an overnight adventure without making reservations at the more popular place to stay in Stanley.  We were pleasantly surprised with the price ,location, quality, friendliness, and scenic view  that we were able to obtain at the redfish riverside inn.  The office was closed when we arrived but called Dianna and she came over within five min.
The room came with two queen beds with what I believed to be 1000 thread count sheets.  Refrigerator, two stovetop burners, microwave and beautiful view of the Salmon river.  We saw a wolf, fox and herd of elk the next morning while having coffee on our deck.   This place was awesome and I can't say enough good thing about it.

"This place was better than I expected. Very very comfy and cozy. I slept wonderfully listening to the rolling water of the salmon river every night! The river is literally right behind the back balcony or porch. We were upstairs and had an incredible view of the river, the mountains and even a couple of elk that came down to drink water from the river.
We reserved a room with two Queen beds and a room with a king. Both rooms were great, but the king room was extra special for my wife and I. We loved it. I would have even enjoyed sleeping on the balcony! Hahahahahaha!
When I first called to ask a few questions regarding making reservations there, the wonderful lady that helped me went above and beyond what I was expecting. I booked a room immediately. Later on that day, I booked a second room. The pricing was way better than I expected. The service was way better than I expected. The rooms were way better than I expected.

"Hotel is extremely outdated and staff needs to brush up on their customer service skills. The property probably hasn't had any sort of renovation since the 90's and it is long overdue.

The next morning I went into the front desk with my receipts only to be told I needed to turn them in the night before. I told the front desk attendant that I was not informed that it had to be turned in the same day I checked in, only to bring my receipts back and the front desk lady would take off the discount.  The front desk attendant rudely said,  ""yeah her and she's not here"". I then asked for a manager who quickly resolved the problem. If you're going to have a strict policy on how long customers have to turn in receipts for credits on a package I didn't even ask for then you need to inform the customers of that policy.

"Nicest roach motel I've stayed at.  It looks cute and quaint from a distance, but don't be fooled into booking a room there.  AC was not adequate.  Had to leave the sliding patio door open for air, which was really hard to move because it was off its rollers.  It was also not secure because the patio is shared with every room on that side of the building.  The room was not clean.  There was trash left from the previous occupant: receipt in the dresser, pizza crust under the bed, comb on the bathroom sink, and water in the ice bucket.  There was a brown crusty substance on the edge of the bathroom garbage can.  The bed sheets were too short and because I'm tall my feet were rubbing on the rough protective pad underneath.  Both beds were like that but I was the only one tall enough to notice.  The map of the grounds they gave us was a bad copy and it was hard to read the amenities.  I thought there might be a nicer version in the amenities book in the room but the book had nothing in it at all.  This means we knew nothing about the hotel other than what was on the bad map.  We didn't have any phone numbers to call for service or if it was possible to order food from the restaurant.  We went in the pool, which had several places where it had cracked and was missing chunks of concrete and tiles.  The deep end separation floaters were all destroyed and were held up by the rope.  We avoided several bad sections of the pool due to it's horrible condition.  When we checked out in the morning it was so early (6:15 AM) that we had to check out at the gift shop and the staff there were not pleasant.  This was also where you payed for gas, and it had the restaurant in it.  The restaurant menu was horrible.  I couldn't order anything due to the limited menu.

"We LOVE western Wyoming's Little America! This was the first Little America we ever visited (over two years ago) and it is our favorite by far! (Little America Flagstaff is a close second.) We've never stayed at the hotel, but the travel center is excellent!

The shower rooms are always spotless and so cozy, each having its own huge, glass-doored, tile shower, and a separate soaking tub as an added bonus that we always look forward to. Showers are $12, and they provide mineral bath gel, bars of soap, and plenty of clean, warm towels. We stop solely for the amazing showers, but stick around a little longer for the food.

The grill has exceeded our expectations as far as a travel center food stop goes - the menu is kinda limited, but they have several different choices, from burgers to breakfast to fried chicken. The food is made to order and everything we've had has been so delicious. (My personal favorite is the breakfast burrito with sausage gravy.) The grill is also open 24 hours a day and serving everything on the menu all day long. Sure beats a basic fast food stop at any of the other travel centers!

In our experience, the staff at this location have been very friendly, welcoming, and happy to meet whatever need that arises, round the clock. If you're a trucker, get here early (or super late night) if you hope to find a parking spot. This is the last travel stop for a while if you're eastbound, and the veteran drivers already know how awesome this place is, so the lot fills up quick and there's usually a ton of create-a-spot tetris going on come nightfall.

The Little America experience is never short of amazing for us, and so memorable that every time we leave we can hardly wait until our next visit! Plus, they have a great view from the parking lot.

"03-19-19 Back for a shower. Maybe a soak in the bathtub. And definitely some home cooking from the kitchen where the big rigs park.

08-7-18  OMG this little kitchen cooks THE best bacon. Hands down. Also the scalloped breakfast potatoes are excellent and with the very good gravy. It's better than home cooked. (Almost) it IS the next best. Good job to the travel center kitchen crew. Oh ya and the pancakes, they are using Krusteaz mix, it never comes out this good for me at home 👍👍.

05-16-18 This morning bacon fried eggs English muffin and hash browns. I feeling like I'm eating at home, the best.
Hmmm. Deep fried peanuts? Says you can eat em she'll and all.

"You will miss your bed at home real quick! The only thing keeping me from giving a two star or worse rating was the fantastic customer service: front desk, housekeeping, and the breakfast attendant. Otherwise this Hilton-brand Hampton Inn and Suites is not worth the higher price point than many of the other options in Aberdeen and is way overdue for a refresh (maybe we can blame Covid-19). The colors and finishes in the lobby, halls and rooms are dinged, scuffed and just plain ugly. The king-sized bed in our non-suite room was caving in and needing replacement. When booking, be aware not all the rooms are like the pictures on the site, some are very plain with no kitchenette, just an awkward mini fridge and microwave by the desk in the room. No real dresser if you like to unpack just a small hutch with sticking drawers that the TV sits on. Pull out style love seat sofa seemed like a great option for the kids, but the window was very drafty and our son about froze the first night. The blankets were very thin waffle weave style. We asked for a second for the next night and he put on extra clothes and was okay. Not comfortable enough for an adult, he slept on it backwards, because even he could feel the metal. The bathroom was a good size which was nice for a family traveling with younger kids, but the bathroom fixtures were loose and the shower almost didn't work. The toilet took several flushes. The pillows in our room weren't the usual mixture of firm and soft (feather and polyfill as it turned out for here), but housekeeping brought us new ones when we inquired at the front desk during breakfast. The breakfast was quite good. Many choices, including an oatmeal area with fixings, plus other hot options, waffles, fresh fruit, yogurt, biscuits and gravy one morning and the next eggs and sausage patties. Coffee options were hot. Pool and hot tub area was small, but we had fun anyways. Pool towels were restocked regularly. Elevator floor became sticky one evening, but as we were in and out, right away they had it mopped I noticed. Again, great customer service that way. We also did laundry which was weirdly on the second floor off in the corner, kinda creepy, but washing and each dry cycle was just a dollar in quarters.

I talked to a manager by the name of Kyle three times and he did nothing about it. My shower was never cleaned even though I mentioned to the housekeeping lady that I had mold in the shower.

They have a brick oven for the pizza and ironically the pizza on the buffet looked awful. Dried out, burnt and unappetizing.

Her response: ""we don't have any. Because we aren't haunted.""

My response: ""oh that's not what I read online.""

Her response: ""Idk where you read that because this hotel isn't haunted.""

Keep in mind she is saying this as a total Karen.

My response (joking tone): ""weird. Better not tell you the website then (laugh.)""

"I was very disappointed.  My stay lasted no more than 20 minutes.

When I arrived, the Clerk was disinterested.  I was told to park in the ""school"" parking lot.  What I was NOT told was that someone needed to be there to unlock the gate.  When I pulled up, the lot was locked.  I had to drive around the block to get back into the hotel, to inform the Clerk it was locked, for one of the bellboys to say someone needed to meet me out there to unlock the fence.  I then drove around the block again and was able to get into the parking lot.

Upon entering my hotel room, I was in disbelief.  I understand this is a historic building, but was surprised to find that to them, historic meant outdated, dingy, dirty, and simply un-maintained.

I rented a 2 bedroom suite.  The kitchen was in a room off of 1 bedroom, while the bathroom was in the other bedroom.  So, to use the restroom, you had to enter the other guest's room.  If you wanted to watch TV, you had to go into the bedroom with the kitchen.  The kitchen was outdated.  The kitchen sink did not have handles and was filthy.  The fridge didn't shut unless you slammed it.  I understand now why their website has minimal photos of their rooms.

There is no AC or central air.  The wall heaters were on when I arrived.  I turned them all off.  To cool my room, I opened the windows.  I was on the 4th floor and had no screen on my large windows.   A loose nail was just sitting on my window ledge.  I called down to the front desk and had them bring up 2 fans, which I put in my windows to attempt some form of cool air in my suite.

There were dead flies and bees on the floor, on the heating units, and in the windowsills.  A live grasshopper was on my bed.  Again.  I was on the 4th floor.

The bed in the room with the TV was broken.  When my guest sat on it, I truly thought she was going to flip off the bed as it sank so far down, so quickly.

After maybe 20 minutes total, I could no longer justify the extreme expense of my room ($630 for two nights).  When I went down to the Clerk, I asked for a manager, and she came up quickly.  I briefly explained my concerns and without hesitation, she said she would cancel my room.  While I was pleased with this resolution, it seemed odd that the immediate response was simply to remove me from the hotel rather than find a more acceptable room.  This leads me to believe this is a common occurrence.

Overall, I would give this hotel 0 stars if I could.  I've read other reviews of this hotel and am floored by those who had a pleasant stay.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJdUxQNlRnEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Silverado+Franklin+Historic+Hotel+%26+Gaming+Complex,+Legends+Steakhouse+%26+Silverado+Grand+Buffet/@42.1195729,-113.2883483,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x5332a6a074a974d1:0xb9438f5b159e64d!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d44.3755516!4d-103.7311272!16s%2Fg%2F11bw_7ly1h?hl=en",ChIJ0XSpdKCmMlMRTeZZsfU4lAs,Hotel,1.0,"Silverado Franklin Historic Hotel & Gaming Complex, Legends Steakhouse & Silverado Grand Buffet",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWIOTiAbEp-6HCwUrBaMeYD6ISHXBIhw0FbRPb=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"Hotel rooms are not great. They have not been updated since the early 1900s. The room my family and I stayed in had 2 bedrooms and a kitchen room that had the sink drains covered with a sign saying "" Do not use sink "". The bedrooms didn't have doors. The only bathroom was very small and was in the room with the two beds. The king bedroom used to have a bathroom but the door was locked with a table pushed up against it. In the entry room there was a big closet room where the king bathroom used to be,  which obviously was not useable. The entry door wouldn't lock. I had to stick a folded up card behind the door lock to make it latch properly. I was worried about a fire in the old building. I made sure I knew where the fire escapes were. One was out of a window in the main hallway that led to the fire escape stairway. Room left a lot of room for improvement.
The gambling hall was old but had some new remodeled bathrooms with gold bars and new tile.
The dining room downstairs was very nice. Newer design features with newer bathrooms too.

"If you are looking to stay at a top-notch hotel. The Best Western Premier Bridgewood (Neenah) is an excellent choice. Our family of 4 stayed here recently while on our family vacation and stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which is a must for us with two teenagers. Each of the kids had their own bed in their own room, we had a separate room with a king bed and there was also a spacious family room. Three 65 inch tvs in each space kept everyone entertained during our downtime. The room was clean, nice and spacious. The hotel itself was very clean and nice in all areas. The pool is nicer than average hotel pools featuring a shallow wading pool for small children and main pool with basketball hoop and a larger slide for older kids.

My family came here as opposed to a big waterpark hotel to hopefully experience a smaller crowd and quieter atmosphere to get away in the winter cold. The stay was overall enjoyable. The rooms felt very clean and we were comfortable. The pool area had everything our kids needed. The water was very warm and that is definitely a plus. Unfortunately there was quite the crowd in the evening and there was plenty of noise after quiet time hours from neighboring rooms but that's to be expected anywhere.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXakpQRVZBEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Best+Western+Premier+Bridgewood+Resort+Hotel/@44.0373592,-99.4628574,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x8803c756e33d5945:0xd5a496fe230dda3!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d44.1694328!4d-88.4804741!16s%2Fg%2F12ml2mq78?hl=en",ChIJRVk941bHA4gRo90w4m9JWg0,Hotel,5.0,Best Western Premier Bridgewood Resort Hotel,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiQobPjw9fipNajhrtB3N0ZyvHVMyYv99qKZrH=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"Would highly recommend this great little Campground. The property was clean, very well kept, and had everything you could need. Play Set for kids, cozy tent & RV sites, coin operated showers, laundry, dishwashing station and even a place for fishermen to clean their catch. Convenient store with the basics as well as some handmade goods and local foods. The quaint little grill in the back makes a mean burger and has tons of food options. I enjoyed the seafood basket which was plentiful (shrimp, clam, scallops & fries).
Everyone we came into contact with was friendly and helpful. The only downside I might mention is that there is only of toilet and one shower for the whole park. We came in the off season, so this was no big deal. Not sure what it would be like in the busy season.
Overall a great place and we loved our stay! Will be returning for sure! Location is key and this place is perfectly situated between, Rialto Beach, La Push, Forks, & the Hoh.

"This review is really mostly about the showers. Haha. Stopped in the store here today during an epic journey through the Olympic peninsula. I was searching for places to shower and came across a trip advisor review from 8 years ago that said there were showers available for 75 cents.  After hiking around in the sea breeze and camping out, I really wanted a shower, so we decided to stop in and ask if they were available and luckily were pointed in the right direction.

Eagle Harbor is located right accross the bay and walking distance to Penninsula State Park. When we entered the property it was beautifully places homes giving you a royal feel of a town. The homes B&Bs are well kept and looks eye pleasing. Upon checking in the host was very friendly and informative about door county. They made us feel home. He check us in and off we went to our room Tilla. Tilla was the 1st room up the stairs on your left. Room was rather small but well designed and very cozy. The antique looks gave it a very stylish english look. The washroom was large enough and had a sky light to it. B&B main building was well decorated (pics attached) and well kept. This beautiful B&B was one of the best we have visited so far. Their breakfast was really good with some freshly baked chocolate Croissant, Cherry Yogurt, Juices Cereals and much more. Their toiletery items were good as well. Very good smelling and nice in quality. This was the best experince for us we felt right at home. Coziest B&B ever.

Afterwards we went into the casino gaming area and we're happy to see it wasn't crowded on a Monday. This gave us an opportunity to learn different games and we especially had a great time at the craps table.

"Our hotel room was rather disgusting.  The carpet is full of stains and the wallpaper is pealing off of the wall in the bathroom.  As you will see in one of my pictures they have a holder in the bathtub for decent size bottles of shampoo, conditioner and soap.  The holder locks which I assume is so that nobody can steal their products.  However, the soap wasn't in the locked container.  I guess that is so that their guests can carry that soap back and forth between the shower and the sink because that was the only soap in the room.  Also, the large bottle for conditioner was completely empty.  It seemed more like a $59.99 room instead of a $159 room.  Very disappointing.

I actually prefer the machines set up this way - a little more distanced, (not that it's a TON) like they are, it makes it quite nice.

I absolutely agree with other reviews that the road noise is significant and that site #14 is only appropriate for a smaller RV.  We were able to back into #14 with a 20' trailer, I cannot imagine doing it with anything larger. It seemed that several of the concrete pads were not level, we noticed an RV with both of its front tires off the ground after being leveled. We enjoyed kayaking but found strong and irregular currents in front of the PUD building. We didn't notice any real beach, but maybe the tides were off while we were there.

"We were driving from Portland home to Canada and it was getting quite late so we found the little town of Shelton and it seemed like a convenient place to stop, being only an hour and a half from the Port Angeles Ferry. We googled a place to stay in Shelton and there was a very limited selection so we pulled into a couple and looked for reviews. Let’s just say they sounded like rat motels from what we read from other travellers. Once we saw there was a Super 8 in Shelton it seemed like the natural place to say as they are typically a decent place to stay being a franchise and all.

We checked in around 8pm and the front desk person was friendly although seemingly bored with his job. The lobby was clean and nice. We had a truck full of purchases that we didn’t want to leave outside overnight so it was nice that there was an emergency door close to where we parked for bringing all our stuff in. The front desk person did state that the hotel was located in a decent part of town and our stuff would probably be fine.

We paid $70 for the night which was high considering it was a fairly old hotel. It appeared to have been renovated at one point but the work was amateur at best. There were simple things like repairs to the towel bar which were just never painted over. Little touches like that go unnoticed when done but become BIG eyesores when left not finished. The temperature in the room was hard to keep consistent. I had to keep turning on and off the heat because the room likely is not well insulated. The bath towels were small and the caulking around the tub was gross. There was a mini fridge and coffee area, which was a nice touch. We could hear the voices from the other rooms and the aroma of the Mary J was thick in the hallways. We did not stay for the breakfast unfortunately as we were up and out to head for the ferry.

We didn’t use any of the amenities, we literally just used this hotel to sleep as a crash pad and it did its job. We felt it was pretty clean and mostly quiet and if we had to stay in Shelton again this would definitely be our first stop.

3 solid stars from Doug and Shannon - It wasn't horrible but it was likely the best option in Shelton.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBaFlHTjhBRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Super+8+by+Wyndham+Shelton/@46.9313928,-124.1293552,9z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x54919635352bb289:0xaee22d72202ca598!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d47.2285512!4d-123.1270808!16s%2Fg%2F1th56pvs?hl=en",ChIJibIrNTWWkVQRmKUsIHIt4q4,Hotel,3.0,Super 8 by Wyndham Shelton,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYfei8LP87Txidgl0hhVxp0Q6-tuNxl-aOy5oL=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"Was there over Valentine's weekend. Snowed aprox 2ft. The snow was expected, the amount not so much. The staff were busy each day with a tractor, snow blower and shovel keeping it as clear as possible. Obviously it was impossible to take advantage of much of the amenities like the pool, playground etc. The gift shop was nice and had some items we purchased. Ate one meal from the bar/cafe as take out due to covid restrictions and outside seating was a bit cold, although they did have several heaters out. The cabin, 5B was clean, warm and romantic.

Special thank you to Don and Kadine who cleaned our room prior to our visit and left their card. The room has plenty of charging stations even one if you forgot to bring the wall block and wire. Wifi and valet are complementary. Additionally, it is maintained well as we constantly saw the friendly staff working. Voyagers (the fine dining restaurant), Latitude 30, a pizza place ? Name with Icees and Hershey’s ice cream, and an outdoor bar and grill are all on site. They were all delicious (and great service). The rooms are not cleaned until after checkout unless a guest requests cleaning. Any extra towels or other necessities are available upon request.

"As a local from Baldwin County, the Perdido Beach Resort is a great option for anyone wanting to spend some time at the beach! It could be challenging to someone not familiar with Orange Beach to decide where to stay, but this place will not disappoint!

Situated just west of Alabama Point at the bridge, the PB Resort is located near The Gulf, a great casual dining option, plus other dining options across the street and nearby. The famous Flora-Bama is just a short drive east!

The PB Resort offers ample parking, but it does fill up quickly. On-site valet is also available. To enter the hotel, you can walk up the side-facing stairs leading from the parking below or remain on the lower level and follow the sidewalk around beneath the upper level.

Upon checking in, we received elastic wristbands that were our room key. Definitely an easy way to keep up with your key instead of always fumbling around in pockets, etc.

Our room was very clean! There was no carpet in our room, just vinyl plank style flooring. A nice upgrade from gross hotel carpet you often find nowadays. We had a small balcony with a bar height table & chairs, that offered a great side view, West facing both the Gulf & the adjacent cove area/ Robinson Island across the street.

The outside bar/patio offers great drinks & food! I thought it was interesting that each time I ordered a Mango Margarita, I got something different but still tasty lol. Bartenders were friendly and quick! Food was also good.

The pool & surrounding grounds are great & create a nice relaxing atmosphere. There was also live music on the days we were there.

Voyagers, one of the many restaurants inside is great! Perfect for date night, or any other celebration.

"The hotel phone and online reservation staff, parking lot, and conference staff are disconnected and disjointed.

I WOULD NOT recommend this place for a conference just based on trying to reserve a room and set up for conferences.

The front desk folks are nice and polite.

I COULD NOT stay at the hotel because they would answer the phone and transferred me to a number that would just disconnect you and emails go unanswered or vague responses with no answers to your questions.

They seem to be focused on valet services and conference fees but making vendors at conferences jump through hoops. You must leave keys with the valet to unload and you can't use the side doors because it bypasses the valet.

"I stayed here for the NENA conference last year, and I'd heard only negative things about the hotel.  I'm happy to say they were wrong!

The hotel underwent a renovation at some point in the last few years so the rooms are more modern.  From what my co-worker said it ""used to look like a dump"".  There are some issues with quality of the rooms where it looks like a flipper did them.  An example is the shower doors where they will slide open on their own.  My room as well as my co-worker had this issue.

The pool is very large with a nice bar and a window to order food and drinks from while outside.  There is also a clear walking path to the beach.  There is an inside and outside pool area.  The inside area has a hot tub and a little area for swimming inside (it's connected to the main pool, so if it storms - you'll need to get out).  The inside area is slippery, so watch your footing and DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS RUN.  The main large pool has a walk over bridge and a gazebo where live music was played every day I was there.

If you want food, they have two restaurants that serve dinner (one casual and one fancy), but they are a little pricey.  The fancier option you'll need to make a reservation for as they are small and don't have space for walk ins.

"I have visited Perdido Resort for Nine Years! It is simple an Excellent and Exceptional Service! They will make sure you had a great visit! The entire staff provide exceedingly service! I would love to mentioned each individually employee, but it would take long time. I never want to leave…after September 16, 2020, Hurricane Sally moved onshore in Gulf Shores, unfortunately the resort experienced some damages, but the Resort has been remodel…it is beautiful! The rooms have beautiful floors and decor! The lobby looks so exquisite and elegant! It was good to see the same staff, especially Lauren and the crew members. You can laid back, relax, listen to some music, drink at the bar, swim at the pool or get in the hot tub or you can stay all day at the beach! Enjoying the beautiful Atlantic Ocean. The location directly on the beach and 5miles to beautiful State Park. The entire resort and room were clean and well kept. The on-site restaurants and bars are wonderful with lots of food selections and price ranges. Want a snack or drink by the pool-right there.

"This was a great place for the conference I attended. I never knew the gulf coast of Alabama was so beautiful. The resort is still recovering from hurricane damage, but it's doing a great job. The hotel staff is friendly and was a great help when needed. The three restaurants all have great food (loved the gumbo). Voyager wait staff will suggest the perfect wine to go with whatever you've chosen and the ice cream from the pizza joint downstairs is the perfect way to cool off after getting that sun burn.

When you get there, make sure you check the hours of the restaurants...the hours didn't match the website at the time of my visit and the bars seem to close earlier than most. (I do suggest the signature 'stress reliever' cocktail....yum).

Ride share services are available, but amazingly spotty. I hope that improves as the country opens back up and more people are getting back to work and traveling. A ride from the nearest airport (Pensacola) can be between 60 and 80 dollars. The resort wasn't charging for parking at the time I was there, so a rental may suit you.

The view from my room was great. Sitting on my balcony and just listening to the ocean, even in the dark of night when you couldn't see it was awesome. I doubt the pictures did it justice. During the day, you can just watch the waves roll over onto the shore, until you decide to stop being lazy and getting down there!

The beach was a fine sand thanks to its quartz and coral mix, which also accounts for its light color.  We were here in May, so the water was about 70 degrees. It took a min to get used to, but was perfect once you did.  Pay attention to the flag at the end of the walkway. Red flag days may be good for sitting and watching but the waves can get up there. My last day was a double red flag day and the waves were up to about 10 foot. Great for the local surfers, not so much for swimmers.  The cushions and umbrellas for the lounge chairs on the beach are about 30 dollars per day. I believe there are discounts if you book multiple days. When you get to the beach, there is staff to help you out with all that, and you can charge it to the room.

All in all, I had a great time. I look forward to going back for next year's conference!

"I was so impressed with Perdido Beach Resort at our recent conference. All of the staff went above and beyond to meet our needs and facilitate the conference. Front desk staff,  catering/restaurant staff, maid service staff were all excellent.  My hotel room was beautiful, clean and comfortable.  The complimentary valet parking was so appreciated upon arrival! The food at all meals was wonderful.  The lobby, with live music in the evenings, was such a pleasure.
Looking forward to returning.
One suggestion I would make is to get rid of the plastic table attached to the balcony railing in the ocean-front rooms. It obscures the view - not so much when you're standing in the doorway, but when you're seated in the room, it really blocks the view. And, while I see the benefit of the bar-height stools on the balcony, for enhanced viewing while on the balcony, they are very uncomfortable after about 5 minutes.  I have a bad back.  I called the desk to request a regular height chair for the balcony, but none were available.  I ended up buying a chair to use on the balcony - left it in the room, as I didn't have room to take it with me.  If you're planning to replace the rest of the balcony chairs with the plastic bar table and bar stool chairs, please reconsider - maybe offer both, or have some regular chairs available, upon request. If you've already committed to installing the balcony bar table, please consider moving it to the edge of the balcony so it doesn't obstruct the view so much from within the room. One small suggestion in a wonderful stay.
There was a very long wait (45 minutes) on the phone to make a reservation. We had to phone in to get the conference rate. Once I reached a reservationist, everything was great.
The live music in the lobby was most memorable. It just made me happy every time I walked through.

The staff was absolutely amazing and I don’t think there was much they wouldn’t do to help us make our stay the best it could be! The pools were very nice, and the indoor pool does not have a closing time which is great because we usually save swimming for the end of the day when we get back after exploring. It was about 55-60 degrees but the outdoor pool still felt nice because it’s heated. Inside has 2 hot tubs!

Had a great stay here. The serenity of being on the beach is amazing. I loved waking up to hear the waves crashing in the ocean. The resort lived up to my expectations. Comfy room and great service. Beds and pillows where nice and soft. The rooms are pretty typical of what you would find in common hotels. Nothing to spectacular. The beach access from the resort was very convenient.

"DON'T OVER PAY -- I paid for the king pool view thinking it was a room with a better view. I stayed in room 2009 (2nd floor) and could see the beach from my room, but not the pool. The only thing I could see near the pool is the rarely used hot tub/children's pool because the roof of the restaurant obstructed the view. I didn't complain because I could see the beach (and honestly, I didn't remember the quirky rates). It wasn't until the night before I checked out that I went to the hotel website to confirm the check out time. That's when I saw that my room was a king angle view beach room that was at least 50/night cheaper. The hotel staff refused an adjustment saying it is a pool view room, just on a lower floor (check the picture - you be the judge). You may be able to see the pool from a room directly above mine, but I think managers should take this obstruction into account. They also said they were booked to capacity and that I should've said something on the night I checked in. What difference would that make if you're booked to capacity????
I'm writing this so future guests don't get duped. Don't pay more for a pool and beach view (pool view room) when you can pay less for an angle beach room.

"When I called to make arrangements with them. I told them what I wanted/expected and they delivered. I believe that we had the best room in the whole resort. I love the fact that everything is right there. We drove in instead of flying so after 12 hours we didn't want to be in the car any longer. They have everything. Your food, alchohol, and if u forgot anything from home, there is a good chance the gift shop has it.

The restaurants available had some amazing food. Not a huge pizza fan but the pizzeria is really good.

Oh and did I mention you can take your alchohol anywhere?  We loved that. You can bring your own or choose from a couple of different bars on site. One of the staff told us only rule was no glass outside. So if you choose to bring your own, make sure u buy cans or aluminum bottles. Also allow coolers on the beach but not in the pool area.

Hotel was very clean (yes I inspected it),every staff member we came in contact from bell hop to bar tenders were super nice and very helpful with any questions we had.

We recommend Perdido Beach Resort to anyone looking for a place in this area.

"It's a pretty nice place. Very convenient to have shops and restaurants on site. Beach access right off the pool is great. The beach is very well taken care of.

The chairs and umbrellas on the beach are for rent. We got out there early and we weren't away of that so we were told nicely to move our stuff. We didn't rent from them as we had our own things but the option is great.

The pool is a pretty big size. It was too cold for us enjoy it though but so was the beach. We went 5/23-5/27. It's not a heated pool. Wish it was and we could have enjoyed it. The temperature when we went was high 70s, 14mph winds and felt amazing outside of the water. If the pool was heated, it would have been amazing. The kiddie pool is also nice but also not heated.

We stayed in room 601 and Our room was nice, room service and house keeping were great. We didn't have enough towels or know how to turn on the shower on but we called house keeping and they were there in seconds with more towels and shower us the shower. (You just pull down on a fixture directly under faucet lol and to turn it off, you just shut the water off. I felt a little dumb haha) Our room had a fridge but no microwave. Beds are super comfy. But oh!!! The sliding door had me about to rip it out. The sliding balcony door has a frame that is above the floor. I stubbed my toe on that frame at least 15 times while I was there and by the last time I did it I wanted to rip out that door. My daughter also stubbed her toe a few times and cried every time. It hurts! So beware of that door. Not sure if all the rooms are like that but 601, yes. I warned you.

Breakfast buffet was super good! Definitely give it a go. Priced well too. The pizza downstairs is also really... Really good!

This was our first time to Orange Beach/Gulf shores and it was nice. If you plan on chilling on the beach of resort the whole time, I would recommend this place. We didn't find much else to do here. Yeah there's a park and The Track is pretty cool but I was expecting to see a bunch of restaurants and activities. None of that here. It's nothing compared to Destin which is just 90 min away but if I go back, and the price is right, I'll stay at this resort again.

Staff was super friendly and helpful.

(Add on statement) This resort has live entertainment around the pool during the day and in the lobby at night.  The talent here is unbelievable!  We witnessed 3 gentleman that put on an impromptu show that was incredible!!  You could not walk through the lobby without stopping to listen.  The piano player (John Brust) is here regularly, the clarinet (Tom Owen) stops in occasionally, and the trumpet (Roger Reupert) was here on vacation and say in.

"A very, very nice resort. We stayed there for a couple of days during the 4th of July. Their breakfast buffet was very good with omelettes made any way you like them. The fireworks display was right in front of the resort on the gulf. Great fireworks display with an all you can eat bbq buffet prior to the fireworks. We had excellent weather and the room very nice with an excellent view of the Gulf of Mexico!

"Perdido Beach Resort starts first with the wonderful people who run the hotel like Susan Newsom who made sure our stay for our 38th anniversary was PERFECT.  The rooms are clean and quiet and the breakfast this morning was fast and the omelet chef made a creation that Wolfgang Puck would be proud to share.   If you want a great place to enjoy the beach with wonderful people to take care of you book now.

Update.

The last night we decided to dine at Voyager's.  Eddie got us the perfect window table and the cuisine is the best on the coast from Pensacola to Orange beach you won't find a better view or better service or better steaks.  Save room for dessert.  I do recommend reservations.

"We utilized this property for a work retreat, and over 4 days we saw the staff in action. Housekeeping was excellent, with the only less than excellent item being that they didn't vacuum my room each day. Front desk staff at reception was attentive. Lobby was spacious and beautifully decorated.

We also used a meeting room that was staffed by food service workers and hotel management, and this was an interesting situation because the first day we were there they took excellent care of us.  The second and third days of meetings, our service was noticeably dropping off. Staff on the first day were well aware of our dietary restrictions in the group and were very detailed to make sure everything was correct. Not so in following days. The last day they basically disappeared after lunch, zero dessert options or drink refills, and we did not see hotel staff again until the end of the day.

"I've stayed at numerous Hyatt Regencys throughout the world. I've never stayed at such a filthy Hyatt. Far from the one in Bangkok.
Throughout the room you see long-term grime, dried unknown fluids on the floors, doors, doorknobs, cabinets, and counters!!
It's so obvious that nobody has deeply cleaned this room for months if not longer. The room smelled exactly like the damp scent I've experienced while staying on offshore fishing boats.
The soap dish is broken and sharp.
My colleague has empty beer bottles on the top shelf in her closet. Toothpaste on the bathroom walls near the mirror. The mirror is filthy as are the grimy glass shower doors.
There's pink mildew growing all over the shower tiles. The towels are the worst. Super thin and non-absorbent. The pillows are terrible and the mattress is too firm. The blanket was so thin it didn't feel luxurious in any way. Lastly, there was some brown liquid dried on the toilet lid.

"My son took me on a trip to Savannah for my birthday. I can't begin to even explain how impressed I was with Hyatt Regency Savannah. When you pull up...valet and busboy. Check-in was seamless. The Christmas decor was gorgeous! Not tacky...very tasteful. The gym is the best gym I've seen in a hotel. The indoor heated pool was huge, and very clean. We had it to ourselves for nearly two hours. The room was immaculate! I e worked in the hotel industry...the housekeepers there don't skip any steps. I appreciate that. Within walking distance (some right across the street) were souvenir shops, breweries, pubs, restaurants... everything you need! Our view was a gorgeous clock tower on city hall.

In the morning across the river is not beautiful but not bad either. I actually loved the mornings drinking my coffee and watching the cargo ships come and go and other various boats.  The pool was nice, my son loved it. There was a problem with our refrigerator as it wouldn't stay colder than 40 degrees so we had to throw out our sandwiches.  The hotel comped one breakfast for us each so that was very nice.  Later I figured out that if you put ice in the ice bag and tie it, then place it into a laundry bag and place that inside the refrigerator- plus keep the cabinet door open to let heat escape- it kept the refrigerator at 35. We would put our leftovers ontop of the ice and it worked. Maybe if they take the cabinet door off that should allow the refrigerator sensor to adequately adjust 🤷‍♀️.

"Thin Walls - We paid a decent price for our room on the top floor with Riverview. Not only did we hear the couple from next door enjoying themselves, but we felt the all the ""rocking"" in our bed as their movements transferred to us through the wall. The shared door probably didn't help the noise, but I've never felt bed movements through a wall before.

It was pretty disgusting. I called to request a transfer and was put on hold for ~10 minutes until the call dropped. I called again and was told that every room was taken. They offered for security to come and knock on their door but I declined. All things considered, our neighbors weren't being terribly loud or obnoxious. We just heard (and felt) all the ""commotion"". I don't necessarily blame our neighbors for cheap walls. Plus, a visit from security might encourage more noise/motion as retaliation.

"We stayed at the Hyatt to be central in our trip to downtown Savannah and it sure was. Everything we did was within walking distance. We used the valet parking and walked around our entire trip. The hotel is very large and the bar downstairs was good. The room had a balcony, but a super tiny one, just to stand and take in the scenes. You can see the boardwalk below and endless flow of river traffic as well as the bridge. The room was spacious and clean. I gave four stars for the price. I feel it was overpriced in relation to the view and type of room.

"Great location.  Inadequate housekeeping for a hotel of that standard and price.  A big pile of hair, yes indeed a pile, had been left in the shower drain.  Made me wonder if they had cleaned the bathroom at all.  Additionally, the main widow was completely smudged as if someone had applied a greasy face onto it.  We mentioned both issues to the front desk and the drain was cleaned up but not the window.  I ended up cleaning the window with a towel.  Another disappointment was the food options... Overpriced 7-inch pizzas for $16 per person, which fortunately tasted good, but $50 for 2 small pizzas and 2 beers... That's ridiculous.

"Nice food. I was a bit early in, about 5:15, but this is a weekend night, Sunday, and there was little server support. Later the bartender weighed in and saved the day. Nice! The food I got was the Buffalo Chicken Flat bread. It was good. The drinks were good. There are wonderful Hyatt hotel views of the Savannah River. This hotel is nice, open, and focused on excellent conference spaces. And even if you aren't seeking conference spaces, you'll likely enjoy this location on River Rd. Figure out the views you want within the hotel and reserve those room views. Nice place in a nice location with quiet, clean rooms.

"Absolutely wonderful hotel.

We stayed here for a drive from FL to Atlanta, and wanted a change of scenery instead of going up I75 again.

It's in an perfect location, on site valet parking is a bit pricey, but the Whitaker Street garage is a very short walk to the hotel and much cheaper to park at.

Walking along the river is quite nice too. Watching the ships is quite cool.

The sun deck on the 7th floor give a nice view of downtown Savannah, and the Garden Terrace on the 4th floor has a great view of the river with comfortable and quiet seating.

When we arrived we saw many signs for the Georgia Association of Realtors, so we were a little worried it'd be noisy, but it is dead silent in the room.

This is by far the quietest hotel room I've ever been in. In the hallway is quite a bit noisier, but in your room it's literally silent.

Even with someone above you, you can't hear them take a shower unless you are in the bathroom deliberately trying to hear it. It's fantasticly quiet.

The bathroom is fairly small, I will agree with those reviews, but it's not unreasonable at all.

In my opinion the only thing that gives away how old this hotel is are the elevators. They look so incredibly dated it's hilarious. The boxy glass elevators are in desperate need of modernization. One of the 3 are out of service for updates, but who knows when that will be done. There's enough reviews on here saying it's been in progress for a while. Only having two elevators was not a hindrance at all though.

The bar was pretty nice too, and the outdoor seating area has a great view of the river. I'd totally recommend the River Street Rendezvous cocktail. It's excellent if you like rum and pineapple juice.

Overall, I'd definitely stay here again. Hyatt continues to deliver on their legendary quality.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpd2ZyUnhnRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hyatt+Regency+Savannah/@32.9613127,-91.8300175,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88fb9e6410b40f99:0x27d1b05532b0a2e7!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d32.0815354!4d-81.0914177!16s%2Fg%2F1vzg32h5?hl=en",ChIJmQ-0EGSe-4gR56KwMlWw0Sc,Hotel,5.0,Hyatt Regency Savannah,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjROC5xbZiq9hMhp0f6hccOz8cU6deKB503kcT=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel
"Our first experience in Savannah, and we loved the Hyatt Regency!

After checking with Google Maps, Expedia, and Priceline; we felt that the Hyatt Regency was our best choice!  Not only were their online ratings high, but the price was not to be best for the historic district!  It was centrally located, and within walking distance of so much!   We were only two blocks from Lady and Sons (Paula Deen's restaurant).  And in a very safe area, which was nice because once you get off the bridge the area is kinda shady.

I'm very funny about hotels.  I like staying in very nice hotels, and expect clean rooms, good customer service and convenience.  Hyatt was all that.

We were met by the valet as soon as we arrived, and I regret not getting his name, because he was such a cheerful fellow!   I think we chatted for a few minutes before he took our car.  Be mindful that the valet service is $38 a night though!  But unlike other parking downtown, we could retrieve our car was much as we wanted, even though we walked everywhere.

The front desk hostess was equally as polite, and we opted for a room upgrade to a king size, river front room.  The room was large, off the fourth floor, and spacious.  L shaped couch, spacious king size bed, beautiful bay window overlooking River Street and the channel.  The room was extremely clean, and the bathroom was equally as nice.  Loved the shower!

We had a wonderful weekend getaway, and just Hyatt Regency certainly made that possible.  When we return, they have our business!

Oh, as a note.  Even though room checkout was 11 AM, they valet parking allows you to keep your car there till 3 PM.   That was really convenient, since we decided Sunday morning to walk to breakfast and then do a little sightseeing.

"What can I say - if you want a great view of the river, this hotel offers it. The staff was super friendly and gave the best suggestion for local eats. The hotel is an upper class style hotel which we don't usually stay at, so there were some nice perks we weren't accustomed to. Someone took our bags from the vehicle, to check in and up to the rooms (tips are customary). All vehicles are Vale parked (which incurs a cost). There is no late check-out option (something my family usually looks for... Mainly because I tend to enjoy sleeping in!). Regardless, it was a very elegant and comfortable hotel. My favorite part?

"Pros:
Service staff other than the front desk was amazing
Food was awesome
Beds were comfortable
Gym setup was spot on

Cons:
Too musky and humid feeling inside the whole building
Vending machines malfunctioning
Front staff was very short with people
Too pricey for accommodations
Pool wasn't worth it
No microwaves in rooms
Elevators were sketchy and not working with ZERO ventilation

I think the bell staff was AMAZING and gave great suggestions for hot spots and restaurants. I felt they went above and beyond.  Along with the restaurant staff they had during the breakfast.  The gym facility was also a plus as you don't find many hotels that dedicate that much money to health amenities. Not to mention the cooling towels,  that was a nice touch! Beds were very comfortable too and clean.

As far as the stay goes I believe it was lacking significantly especially for over $200 a night for a room with no view and for what was advertised online.  The air quality in the building all together was humid and sticky feeling the whole stay.  The elevator air was MISERABLE! The bathrooms in the rooms have no ventilation to move air when showering.

Numerous elevators were broken and unusable on a consistant basis to where I felt the need to take the stairs as a safety precaution not to mention with the fire alarms going off (I understand they might not have the ability to control fire alarms).  The mini fridges could only hold a few items and there was no microwave except for one we found 2 floors below us.  The vending machines also seemed to be malfunctioning as we had family choose water and it gave them a soda.

The breakfast served was AMAZING! The peach pound cake was out of this world!  Again the staff's hospitality... they were 100% Johnny on the spot. But with such pricey rooms I don't understand why there isn't a complimentary breakfast or to charge a lower amount.

The pool downstairs was also another area that was overly elaborated on the website and in person, was a complete let down...it was murky looking with high chlorination and not much to work with when more people got in (10 people was pushing space).

Upon our departure we called the front desk to have a cart brought up to take out our luggage,  we were told it would just be a minute and they would take care of it (this was really the only staff I don't feel weren't so welcoming). After 30 minutes of waiting we looked out into the lobby to see if it was busy because it was around check in time and there were NO lines.  My mother went downstairs and spoke to a bellboy about getting a cart and he had no idea someone was waiting for one to be brought up.  Again bellboy hospitality was spot on! He even clarified the quickest directions to get us home.

I also want to mention the cleaning staff... although we did not encounter them taking care of our room, everytime I passed someone in the hallway they were smiling and saying hello. This was our first time to Savannah and while being leery in new places I must say we felt like we were welcomed there as though we were family stopping in for a visit.  I just wish the hotel amenities were more up to the standards they present online. This was our first time staying in a Hyatt hotel as Hilton has been my #1 go to for years and venturing out has shown why I have been loyal to their hotel...

It's unlikely that I would stay here again, but if I did it would only be due to how awesome their service staff treated us😊!!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBLTRiYlBBEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hyatt+Regency+Savannah/@32.9613127,-91.8300175,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88fb9e6410b40f99:0x27d1b05532b0a2e7!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d32.0815354!4d-81.0914177!16s%2Fg%2F1vzg32h5?hl=en",ChIJmQ-0EGSe-4gR56KwMlWw0Sc,Hotel,3.0,Hyatt Regency Savannah,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGiVyLwwg3SH4l89mB2-Xc5IJCO5GPjNjo05Ah=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

We had  booked 2 king size riverview rooms. $424.46 each for 2 nights. You can see the Queen Mary right outside of our window. The room was nice and spacious. The bed was so comfortable. The elevator came quickly. There's a restaurant on site. The hotel is just absolutely beautiful.

"Stayed here for the 4th of July week. Not a bad drive from here to Tybee island, about 30 minutes one way. Everyone seemed to enjoy their job or acted well. You can always tell the one or two ppl who don't want to be at work, but they still were helpful. The gym and pool are below the lobby are seem nice. Plenty of workout equipment and never crowded. Too many restaurants to choose from and the food was awesome! My wife and I did the breakfast at the hotel every morning with our daughter for the convenience. It cost around 20ish per person. There's a horse carriage ride pick up right outside the front entrance. So everything seemed really close to this hotel and if you stay on July fourth book a hotel room facing the westin hotel.

"My husband and I vacationed in Savannah for July 4th.  We stayed at the Hyatt from June 30 to July 5. From the time we arrived til we left the customer service was excellent. The valets, restaurants servers and the front desk were all great. They also help you purchase tickets for the trolley tours. The hotel is very nice and we had a riverview room and watched the cargo ships pass by and the fireworks on the 4th. They have an elevator that takes you down to River St. The only con was breakfast wasn't included in the price. The buffet was $19.95, but it is very delicious.

"So I love Hyatts and are even Hyatt members (but am not necessarily brand loyalist) and thought how can we go wrong with staying here especially with the location. Well other than the location, I have to say for a Hyatt we were disappointed. To begin with we upgraded our room to get a water view with a bacolony. Being a member and having the app it allows you to upgrade the day or two before your reservation. Well, our room was ready early but it wasn't the right room we paid extra for. 😒 it was a water view from the side of the building (oh I see what they did there that's sneaky) but where is my damn balcony. To make matters worse every time I went down to deal with it at the front desk there was a huge line and only 1-2 people working the front desk ... Which seems a little short staffed considering its such a huge hotel on the weekends. I would always just give up and resolve to come back later. A couple times I tried calling on the phone and no one would even answer the phone just pick up the phone and hang it up. 😡. The major problem we had was the Valet service. SLOW, SLOW, SLOW. Again, because they are often parking your cars off site (we were told this by the actual staff) they DON'T have ENOUGH PEOPLE WORKING. I had read the reviews and peioke griping about the valet so I told me husband hey call about 20-30 min before we need our car. We would get the phone call to our room ""please proceed down to valet your car will be ready in 5 min"" and THEN STILL WAIT ANOTHER 15-20 MIN. This is ABSOLUTELY unacceptable especially when they are charging you $30/night and MANY other hotels in the city that are just as expensive are free or not nearly the cost. I dont mind paying, don't get me wrong I actually love the convenience of valet.... But DAMN you better get that service locked down because it is making your hotel look like ammature hour! Just because the inside is nice and reflects a Hyatt chain doesn't mean you can SKIMP on customer service because the word will get out and the Hyatt Brand will come calling.

"Carter Caves Campgrounds State Park Adventure. We stayed at the campground this December in our Toy Hauler TT for five days.
They have 33 miles of hiking trails. 5 caves for exploring a 3 Natural Bridges that are spectacular. The campgrounds have full to primitive hookups. No water in the off season they do have electric. 20-30-50 amp. Two large bathhouses which one is open souring off season. Play grounds and a put put mini golf. Ice machines store is open during the offseason.

Welcome lodge is very nice it’s also where you will need to get permits for cave exploring.

Dogs are allowed on trails but not the caves. 2 people minimum to explore.

2000 acres of exploring with a small lake for fishing.
Must definitely a beautiful place anytime of the season.

"So it's very confusing but we stayed at the Carter Caves Campground not the resort or cabins.
We arrived one day early figured we would try our luck. We were met on the office by a disinterested kid. Once we got through that, we discovered that our sight #8, had the electric pedestal aprox 75' from the site.
We returned to the office and were moved to sight #3. Once we backed in, we discovered that the electric pedestal had 20 or 50 Amp. No 30.
Back again and moved into #6. It worked but I had to back all the way to the end of the pad and my power cord just made it.
Water took two hoses to reach and had to wrap to the opposite side of the camper.
We had a nice view but the picnic table was not usable due the the slope.
The showers were ok but the curtain bottom was covered with mold.
Overall a busy Campground, dogs and some guy in a tow truck that liked to let everyone know he had an air horn.

We did Cascade Cave interesting especially where the connecting part of the cave has fallen a d the waterfall worth the small admission price.

"The rooms are great. Occasional ant, fly etc.- but you should expect that in a lodge near woods. The room felt clean. The balcony is wonderful. Only thing I missed was my pillows. Their pillows are not the greatest. So you may want to bring your own. We were there on a weekday, so the restaurant didn't stay open as late. But we were still able to order pizza and have it delivered. Tyler's Pizza is AMAZING. You have access to the campground pool. We didn't do this though. The food we had at lunch in the lodge restaurant was great. The waitress was a very charming, young blonde. Very sweet.
The cave tours were super easy to sign up for. Took like 2 mins. We took the Cascades tour and we were fortunate to get to do the Ghost and Legends tour which was a lantern tour of the Saltpeter Cave (a portion) and the X Cave by Mason. The lantern tour was SUPER cool. Highly recommend. Wish there was a way to tip your tour guides. They do great. We also took a hike on the 3 bridge trail. (3.8 miles I think)
Beautiful scenery. Wish there were markers saying how much further you had. It's hard to keep track when you have a tour later in the day.  Overall, this is good for a day/ 1 overnight trip. We did everything we wanted to do almost in a day. The park is well taken care of. If we had stayed another night, boredom could set in.

This is obviously a much smaller cave system and park than mammoth caves.  However mammoth caves while impressive due to size doesn't really have quite as much cave feel to it because of that size...

If you come, make sure to check out Horn Hollow cave. There’s a short little crevice near the main entrance of the cave, and if you follow that, it narrows and narrows. Prepare to be crawling on your stomach in an underground creek. You’ll need to be pretty narrow and pretty flexible (I’m 6’ and 180 lbs. and I made it though with some difficulty). It goes back a good 200 feet, until it opens up on this huge underground waterfall fueling the creek. It’s almost as big as the one in Cascade.

I love this place. I had the best tour we were almost late. I didn’t schedule anything ahead of time. Very knowledgeable our female guide was. I told her she could just run us through the cave.

"Carter Caves State Resort Park is one of the crowning jewels in the Kentucky State Park system. The hiking is truly awesome, the fishing is vastly underrated and the staff, from the front desk, the kitchen, housekeeping and park employees all work hard to insure your stay is enjoyable.

You'll find natural rock arches, massive caves (some which you can explore self guided), a couple waterfalls, trails for every skill set, a boxed canyon and enough wildlife to have you googling what kind of bird you just seen. (It was a bright red and black Scarlet Tanager for me.) In the summer, they have a nice pool with a diving well.

With capable leadership from Park Manager Chris Perry, Carter Caves State Resort Park is poised to deliver good times and millions of memory making moments for all who are wise enough to visit.

"We had a neighbor tell us about Carter Caves so we decided to do a day trip here. During our visit we toured X Cave, Horn Hollow, and Cascade Cave. The park was very clean and well organized. We didn’t know what to do and where to go at first but were quickly and easily able to find staff that showed us the ropes. Our first tour was with Tristan at the X Caves. Tristan was informative and the Cave was interesting overall we enjoyed it. The only thing we wish he would have done differently is slow down . We moved so quickly through the cave that it felt like at times we were trying to keep up with the group instead of getting to enjoy the experience. Our next tour was a self guided tour to Horn Hollow. We were informed that we needed to bring flashlights with us so we purchased some at the gift shop. The permit process was easy however finding the cave not so much. They literally circled it on the map and said “it’s somewhere around here” and to stay on the green trail. We kept walking and walking at one point we saw a couple walking down what appeared to be a creek bed and wondered to ourselves is that the cave entrance? We pulled out our phones to Google it, it was. Then once we got to the mouth of the cave we saw that it was flooded. We were not aware that the mouth of the cave was going to be in a creek bed and the water at the mouth was already at shin level. Not wanting to spend the rest of that day in wet shoes and socks we decided to not venture inside. Our last tour of the day was to Cascade Cave. Our tour guide was Skylar. Skylar has a family history when it comes to this cave and it is clear that he is both knowledgeable and passionate about it. He has a great personality and really took his time sharing the cave with us. He also told us about some of the other caves and tours we would not have known about otherwise and would love to check out in the future. We were so thankful that our tour was with him as he really made the experience.

"Beautiful park. Lots of trails, a small babbling brook to play in , a nice lodge , 2 guided cave tours. We went on the X cave, which was a little disappointing for an experienced cave tour lover, but a nice introduction to caving. Kids will especially love it since you're IN  A CAVE! haha. There are only a couple of highlights and not really anything kiddos will hurt if they touch (although touching is discouraged) Quite chilly inside. You might want a jacket. There are lots of above ground trails and the ones we wandered down were quite easy. The lodge is more upscale, with a nice stone fireplace in the lobby.

"Had a great family vacation get away! Stayed in the Cottages, was not expecting to be as big as they were. Very roomy, had everything we needed. Only negative things I could find were no fire pits outside (some cottages had fireplaces inside) and the water pressure was pretty low. But the water temp was great! 2 bedrooms with 4 queen beds and 2 bathrooms. Kitchen was an added bonus as they had a full oven and microwave to create our own lunches and dinners. Charcoal grills are provided at each cottage out front. The cottage area is a private circle with a full-size playground in the middle grassy area. Newly paved roads made it nice to also ride bikes in the circle area for the kids.

We ate at the lodge restaurant and it was as most, open but with select foods. Also had specials and desserts. Price was ok, I thought it was more on the higher side. Staff very friendly as they’re also staff that manage and run the lodge on site.

The walking trails was a great way to spend the time when not lounging around or exploring the caves. There is a boat ramp for canoeing and an area that was great and way out of the way for fishing!  We went on the guided tour of Cascade Cave and it wasn’t anything out of the ordinary of a cave but the guide was knowledgeable and made the tour fun.

For never being here before, this was a great family vacation! I’ve already been talking about returning and doing different things while coming back.

"Update 2/14/23

Walking up to the main entrance of the casino was worse than before.  Cigarettes are all over,  things need painted and everything could do well with a good powerwashing.  Nothing about this 1st glance gives me ""destination resort"" vibes.    We arrived around 8:30 in the morning so it was obvious this littered mess was not fresh.  If this place wants to pull in new customers and become a major moneymaker,  things need to change.  When your facility is much less clean than the local gas stations,  you have an issue.   Granted,  the inside is clean,  but the outside is what sets the tone.  Do better, Mardi Gras!

Original review:  We have stayed here numerous times through the years.  This last visit was already a letdown due to no pool and none of the amazing breakfast foods.  The room was not the cleanest and the gold fixtures are now chrome and gold due to someone using the incorrect cleaner.  All of the restaurants in the casino were closed and there was no room service.

My suggestions to help would be:

Breakfast:  Since the old buffet style won't work,  the easiest way to serve the delicious hot breakfast would be for each room to put an order in either online or by calling concierge.  Their items would be prepared and could be dropped off contactless outside of the room or could be picked up in the lobby.

Cleaning:  Supervisor checking rooms to make sure they are bring cleaned properly.  They should also be sure to teach proper use of cleaning agents and which products to use on each surface.

Restaurants:  If none of the on site eateries are going to be open,  either offer meals via room service again or at least put together a listing of nearby restaurants and contact information.   Maybe even see if any would be willing to give hotel guests a discount.

I know some of these items seem small but if you want to call yourself a resort and be a destination vacation spot,  you can't overlook the little things.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4XzVhMW53RRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mardi+Gras+Casino+%26+Resort/@35.8076728,-90.2479862,6z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x8848cba4893b5411:0xe687c321e466648c?hl=en",ChIJEVQ7iaTLSIgRjGRm5CHDh-Y,Casino,3.0,Mardi Gras Casino & Resort,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpkP9vjfIILbqbjx2bLJ7WguDPkiF83qC8iUM1=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"This place doesn’t look like much when you pull up, but once inside you can tell that they take pride in this hotel.
Everything in the lobby was very clean, neat and orderly. It looked like this place had been remodeled recently.
The breakfast and sitting area are located right off of the main entrance across from the lobby.
It too was very clean and neat.
I stopped here for one night on my return trip home from Florida.
I always choose a Best Western because the rooms are very clean, they give you complimentary toiletries, blow dryer, iron and ironing board, a coffee pot and free coffee in your room. You also get a refrigerator and microwave in your room and free WiFi.
I always try to get a king size bedroom. The beds are super comfortable, and I’m able to get a good nights sleep.
With my room came with a complimentary breakfast. This is standard with most Best Westerns.
This Smithville Best Western has an indoor pool which is permanently closed and a gym. I did not use them.
For breakfast they serve scrambled eggs, ham or bacon, grits, homemade waffles, that you make yourself. Cold cereal, oatmeal, fresh fruit, yogurt, biscuits and sausage gravy, bagels, toast, muffins, pastries, coffee, tea, juices, or milk. You can have as much as you want. The breakfast is constantly replenished by a sweet older lady.
Checkin was very easy. The front desk staff was extremely nice, and made some recommendations when we asked. They have a free parking lot.
This hotel is located off I-95, this low-key hotel is an 8-minute walk from shopping at Carolina Premium Outlets and 2 miles from the Ava Gardner Museum. The prices were reasonable for this hotel.

"We came to Lancaster to enjoy the New Year. We stayed in the King Villas. The room itself was beautiful. The bathroom could have used some updating. Also the  kitchenware needed better cleaning, but nice nonetheless. The real issue with my stay and why I would never decide to visit again was the customer service and my personal property. I stayed overnight on New Year’s Eve. I woke up in the morning to find my white car parked in the lot COVERED with confetti. My car was the only one within that lot covered. I was understandably upset, and wanted to rectify the situation. I called the front desk and explained the issue. I understand it was not the hotel, but rather other guests and my personal property is not the responsibility of the resort. Where is the accountability for the guests they house? They offered minimal help or care. The most they could offer to assist was windex and paper towels or filing a police report. They had no usable hose on the property where I could have rinsed off my car. They offered no kind of compensation towards a car wash, even $5.00 would have gone a long way. The confetti had to later be POWER-WASHED from my car.

"We stayed for an overnight stay this past weekend and had a wonderful time! We were in a poolside room which had a door right into the indoor pool. This was so nice to be able to walk right out, swim, and head right back into our room. The room was clean and comfortable and had plenty of space. The outdoor pool is a good size and has plenty of seating available. We used the mobile app for check-in, check-out, and the key to our room which worked great and it was so nice to not have to go to the front desk for anything.

We explored the hotel and the event rooms were so beautiful. The location isn't directly near much, but it is pretty close to downtown Lancaster which had some great restaurants and shopping.

The main issue I think worth noting is that the wifi in the hotel, at least in our room, was basically unusable. We had to use mobile data to use the internet and the app for our room key.

"We stayed here over the Thanksgiving weekend to visit family.  We had a room right off the pool so our grandchildren could come visit and spend time swimming. It has a tropical atmosphere and a hot tub. The door to the pool is locked from the outside at night and there is an alarm that alerts you if someone opens the door from the room. This is great for safety for families with small children. The room we had was spacious with 2 queen beds. The room was clean.  I liked the vanity make up area outside the bathroom but the lighting should be more conducive to being able to see better. This hotel has a bar off the dining room and the dining room had certain hours of operation...which is ok as I like the option to eat in the dining room instead of going out.There was a convenience store which carried lots of goodies including great coffee from Lancaster County. I really like the classic charm throughout this whole resort and the  service of the staff was
superior throughout.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is the comfort of the bed. We woke up each morning with backaches. Maybe mattresses should be upgraded 🤔. Otherwise a classic hotel which I enjoyed.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdmF1Z2JREAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Eden+Resort+%26+Suites/@37.5346621,-86.6444706,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89c62345d15c3499:0x2052ca1f95385113!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d40.0688171!4d-76.2992095!16s%2Fg%2F1tfb2yrq?hl=en",ChIJmTRc0UUjxokRE1E4lR_KUiA,Hotel,4.0,Eden Resort & Suites,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOThT9IDxdy3b-fzUZfeyiNZnLEY8Q5oaGu6pQV=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

Absolutely loved our experience! Our daughter had requested a night at a hotel with a swimming pool for her birthday. We had made mention of this to staff when booking and asked for a ballon in the room as something special. Staff went above and beyond by including some snacks for her as well as a card in addition to the ballon. Needless to say our 4 yr old freaked out when she saw it. Thank you so much to the staff that made our night special for our girl! We got a poolside room and so we were able to make the most of our time swimming. Our room was spacious and clean.

"Overall, we had a good stay. Came here with my sisters, mother, and nieces for a girls night out. The room was clean and comfortable but a bit dated. Staff were friendly and helpful during our stay.

The pool was heated, but it was still cold in my opinion. They ran out of towels when I had arrived to the pool so I had to wait until I was ready to leave and they had just restocked the towels. The playground was small, but nice. The basketball court was also nice. The table tennis could have been maintained better, the net was broken so was the 1 paddle that was at the table. While I was there the restaurant was closed for renovations. So were unable to get room service despite the front desk telling me the other restaurant was opened, but I was unable to get connected to that restaurant.

Update, we did goto the indoor pool and it was enchanting. Indoor heated pool was great. You get cards for towel service when you check in and get a fresh towel when you arrive to the pool. The jacuzzi was corded off due to maintenance. While that was dissapointing for our evening I greatly appreciated thier concern for guests safety.
We also had dinner at the restaurant and that was incredible. They have this seafood dish with a tomato broth that was divine. Everyone in our party raved about thier food.
Breakfast, we would advise to skip the buffet, it was not up to the rest of the standards. Pastries were days old, the hot fares were mediocre.  The fruit was nice but that was not worth the price. So I would suggest breakfast offsite and there close places to choose from.

"This was our first weekend away from our 5 children in over 2 years and the Eden Resort and Suites did not disappoint. From the welcoming atmosphere, cleanliness, and phenomenal staff we will definitely make this our first choice for another staycation. The staff was accommodating and courteous.  While walking down the hall to my brother and sister-in-law's room carrying her birthday gifts a staff member in front of us turned around and asked if we needed assistance carrying anything.  The room was spacious and comfortable and we loved the adults-only floor. We all actually decided to not go out and do an activity but stayed in the room and had beverages and played cards till after 2 AM. A big plus is where our room was and the ""J"" entrance we were a mere 100 steps to the Sheetz :) The only complaint we have is with the pool. We have no problem and understand the booking of time slots to ensure everyone's safety I wish it was open later for adults. Most places we have visited only allow adults after 10 PM.

"Be aware that unless you book directly through the Tropicana hotel (website), you're more likely working with a booking agency (not directly affiliated with the Tropicana Hotel) and you won't  know the total cost of the room until you check in at the hotel.

Your room is subject to taxes and fees (TOURISM FEE/TAX 2; CASINO FEE/TAX 2; A.C. OCC SURCHARGE/TAX 2; RESORT FEE/TAX 2) that booking agents don't disclose when you make and pay for your reservation (a least ours didn't).

These additional fees and taxes increased the cost of the 2-night stay from $92.70 to $184.01.

While the final cost may not be outrageous, it is certainly (at twice the listed nightly rate) more than you expected when you booked the room.

In addition to that, our booking agent charged only $50 (of the total cost of our stay) to my credit card at the time of booking, leaving the remaining balance to be paid at check-in. And the reservation was not confirmed for the section of the hotel whee we prefer to stay.

Our room was cold both nights but after a 'jump start', it started to warm up a bit (recycling regularly on it's own for the 1st time since we arrived). Annoying, yes. But not worth relocating or having to wait for someone from maintenance to show up and address the problem. The room was clean, good sized, uncarpeted, poorly lit (and heated) with just a desk, one lonely desk chair, a safe and mini fridge (that whined) and no microwave.

Spacious bathroom with pull bars in the tub/shower but only one hook to hang things on (towels, PJ's, wash cloths or anything else).

Parking is NOT FREE, but it's reasonable.

As long as you know what to expect when you book, you can relax and enjoy the place. It would be nice, I think, if Jersey lawmakers would require these booking agencies to disclose their status and all of the additional costs when they take your call.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtb3FyeHF3RRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tropicana+Atlantic+City/@37.5346621,-86.6444706,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89c0ee64503d341f:0x5ae59bb688f27ccb!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.3523692!4d-74.4445618!16zL20vMDVnNXJt?hl=en",ChIJHzQ9UGTuwIkRy3zyiLab5Vo,Hotel,3.0,Tropicana Atlantic City,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpDochY69AEPJ3UHBP36bY9fiYebdiTXipNKZi=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"We had an overall great experience! Food selections were fantastic. I'd give it a 4 star but we stayed in the West Tower and it is desperate need of a renovation. Wallpaper peeling, we found a cockroach on the wall and the bedding is very poor quality. Room was freezing with no way to change the temperature.
At the casino, drink service at the table games is SOOOO slow and a soda if you go get your own is $5. There should be drink rounds at least every hour, not 3 hours.
Valet service is super slow so give yourself time.

"Stayed at the north tower with my boyfriend back in September. There was a horrible storm those two days so couldn’t venture around AC much but we still had a lot of fun as there is plenty of things to do in the resort.

Room/cleanliness: I’m a smoker (horrible- I know) so I appreciated there being smoking rooms and smoking areas in the casino so I didn’t need to go out in the wind & rain just to have a smoke.
The room was in a convenient location. Right above the casino and near the elevators. Our window view was overlooking the casino which was pretty cool. The furniture was a little dated and the cleaning was ehh but that’s pretty much the case with all smoking rooms in any hotel/resort.

Casino: clean. I saw several employees doing detailed cleaning while playing the slots.

Parking: If staying in the North tower, I recommend using the valet. It was very convenient and the charge for it wasn’t much.

Staff: no complaints about the Tropicana staff. All very friendly and helpful.

Location: perfect location to the boardwalk and beach. I definitely recommend The Rain Forest Cafe located on the boardwalk.

My only 2 complaints (one was my fault).
1.  was our experience at Hooters there. From the moment we walked in the door, the waitress was very rude. Maybe she was having a bad day but it seemed like she took one look at us and assumed we wouldn’t tip well (we tip a standard 20-30% (depending on service which I think is very fair). We were nothing but kind to her but she was still extremely rude. The other waitress walking around seemed delightful, I wish she was our waitress instead.
Complaint 2: we went during the week days in the fall so the pools weren’t open. That’s my bad for not seeing that in their website. So if you want to use a pool, double check the pools are open.
I think all the bad reviews were from people expecting it to be a five star hotel. Most said there wasn’t much signage for locations but if you look up, there are signs with arrows pointing where to go.

Over all, we had a great time and definitely plan to be back soon!

At the Tropicana there are multiple towers there is so much to explore. There are restaurants and shops in the hotel. No need to leave the hotel. There are a few shops open 24/7. Tacos at 2am was perfect. We ate at PF Changs and it was absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was great too. We also ate at Casa taco, Hash house a go go, and many other places as there are so many to pick from. The boardwalk is right outside the marketplace (where most the food shops are).

I was coughing and sneezing alot. My eyes were itching. So as i started to investigate the room my sheets were dirty. The walls had black drippings rolling down the entire room walls. Maybe water stains but it was yucky! I had a double bed room . The water burned my skin and is difficult to get it to the right temperture. My phone fell and upon pulling the beds  out i saw so much yuck which explains why my allergies were all over the place. The tv was dusty. Towels had burn marks and more.

"Our trip was booked several weeks prior to our arrival. The self check in booths were declining many booked hotel guests, stating our rooms weren’t ready and they’d emhoyelus when it was. It was alr 6pm, and the kiosks weren’t accurate! The lines after the mass confusion and frustration began and lasted beyond an hour and some for others, with less than minimal staff at the desk to accommodate the error. This is unacceptable.
Mind you, we are here with my step daughter for a cheer competition, so there are many parents and elementary aged and younger children filling this lobby waiting for resolution.
After we’re able to get checked in, we come up to our room in the west wing… seriously the most ghetto room I’ve ever stayed in. I would never have anticipated a casino hotel room to be in such dated/dirty/and sloppy conditions. Bathroom is filthy, tub/shower walls stained and smells like cigarette. Cigarette burn hole in bed linen, and the paint job looks like it was done by my grandchildren. The coffee maker is broken and filthy with thick calcium buildup. There isn’t a dresser to put our clothes away. Mold in the shower molding.
The pictures on your website do NOT portray an image of the trash hole we walked into last night! We’re beyond disappointed, and have never had an experience as poor as this at any casino we’ve gone to before. I plan on calling the front desk this morning for some kind of resolution.
Addendum… step daughter just showed us a used band aid in her bed 😣
Spoke with management yesterday, they returned our phone call after 9 hours, offered us a different room today, however, it’s after 2pm and the room just now is ready. The replacement coffee maker and clean linen by the folded lump sum came up after several phone calls after 10:30 pm last night.
Manager stated this casino sleeps whatever sum of people and it’s difficult to keep up and please everyone. Change of room without a guaranteed time and a $50 food and beverage voucher for one of their places within the casino doesn’t make this stay worth the money I’ve spent at this casino!

"This was my first time at Tropicana Atlantic City. I stayed in the Havana Tower with 1  King size bed.
My first impression--the place is a sprawling monster of a Hotel and Casino resort. From the hotels lobby and check-in located on the lowest level (below the main casino floor accessible by escalators) to my room was a good 10 minute walk. If you have a lot of luggage it's going to be a workout for you. If you can't walk long distances or have any issues getting around, I suggest getting a room closer to the lobby and casino floor. The walk to my room involved many long inclined hallways, a pass through the shops and restaurants in the Quarter  and finally to the Havana Tower.
My room was big and looked very inviting and clean. But upon further inspection, it had it's share of problems. Smudges and  crud and on multiple door jams, and the bathroom vent and the room In-take A/C vent were disgustingly dirty. It looked unhealthy. (See pics)  Not sure if it is mold or just thick black dust but it should be cleaned REGULARLY. Besides that, I wanted to simply relax and take a shower but there was no body wash or hand soap for the sink. I called house keeping and was told they would be sending some up to the room immediately. I waited for over an hour and nothing showed up from housekeeping. Had to call again.  Someone showed up 30 minutes after that. (My stay was on a Wednesday and it took that long to get something that they forgot to put in the room. I can't imagine how long I request, like body wash or simply extra towels, would take on a weekend.
The hotel immenities are a pool and a very impressive  entertainment, shopping and restaurant area called the Quarter. It boasts over 24 restaurants, 25 shops of various goods and 22 bars and clubs and other entertainment like an Escape room.

"So far, not so good. Self check-in kiosk put us in a double when we reserved a king. Currently waiting in line in the South Tower Lobby, a long walk from the Havana Tower where we were, for assistance in rectifying the situation.  We have already had to change our dinner reservation at Ossu. I will update once we are settled. Not getting better: only 1 person working the counter. People behind us have been waiting for an email that their room is ready for an hour. Wow.
8:30 and Gary is now helping us. ""The Kiosk wouldn't make a mistake. Whatever room you booked is the one you got.""
Except it's not the one we booked and, oh look, we have the confirmation.
""Well, if a king bed is important to you,I can put you in the North Tower. ""
Yes, since it is what we booked, we'd like the king.
So, we're in the king on the 17th of the North Tower. It's fine. Smells vaguely of cigarettes and marijuana, but it's  AC so... We may make our new reservation at 9.
I'll update tomorrow,  but at this point, my advice is avoid this property.

Good morning. Final update: The bed is pretty soft, but would be fine if there was any substance to the pillows, or if there were more pillows (4 small ""feather"" pillows on a king bed with no extras in the closet).
The temperature was impossible to regulate to any satisfaction. See the picture of the 70's technology thermostat.
The shower looked beautiful, however the design is awkward and it functions poorly.

We come to AC plenty and took a chance on the ""New"" Tropicana on this visit. This was a mistake.  Stay somewhere else.

"The Trop is usually my go to in AC because there are tons of food options and multiple bars with happy hour deals. After this visit I may be looking for a new destination. Service was absolutely terrible throughout the entire casino. Every drink ordered AR a slot machine came out wrong, then the waitresses argued with me that they brought what I ordered. Some weren't even close. I ordered a rum and coke and they brought me a beer instead. Food was delicious every place we ate, but again terrible service and only had 2 meals in 4 days that came out correct the first time.  Housekeeping was another nightmare. We called at 9am Sunday to request service. We were out all day and no one came to clean, bring fresh towels etc. We called again and the desk told us someone would be there in an hour. We came back after dinner and the garbage was not taken, towels not taken, bed not made, and a pile of new towels and soap left on the bed. The next morning Housekeeping walked in without knocking. We told her it has ok and she could clean the room but she left and never came back. Had to call the desk for toiletries and again no one came. Day three we put the do not disturb sign on and Housekeeping knocked on the door for 10 minutes until I got up and answered. They asked if we wanted service. We had also asked for extra pillows when we checked in...I just checked out on day five and still no pillows.

"The Tropicana has its decent high points, but there are issues as well:

Issues:

For blackjack fans: dealer hits on soft 17s.

Service is less than good. Front desk was manned by one person for a 40 person queue. It looked like a line at an airport. Employees can be pretty bossy too.

Listed amenities are more like ""services you can purchase"" or ""sometimes available"". To the extent that you have to pay $35 or buy a $200 massage to get access to the hot tub for a day. So don't think you can go relax at it with $$$. And it's only available on certain days. I also think you have to rent a chair at the outdoor pool if you want to sit at it? The indoor pool is only available on certain days, and is by reservation.

Some games have seriously reduced payouts. Example, a side bet at blackjack has payouts nearly cut in half compared to what other casinos run the same bet at.

As others have mentioned, the hotel and casino are dated and show it. It gives the impression that things are just being kept as is. No serious upkeep since what seems like a long time ago.

Strengths:
The resturaunt selections are pretty nice, but on the pricey side. I'd recommend the Petitie Creperie in the quarter for an affordable, pleasant meal. They have a wide selection of interesting crepes and other breakfast foods.

My room in the south tower was pretty nicely kept and seemed modernish. The shower was modern and high quality.

"HOTEL: Stayed here recently Saturday night in the Havana Tower—room was fairly spacious and clean.  Decor was a bit outdated but the bathroom was nice.  Even got a partial ocean view!  The walls are thin, so you can hear the traffic outside at night and the guests in the hallway if they are loud.  Check-out was Sunday and it was a nightmare getting back to the parking garage—there was a line of 40+ people just waiting for the elevator to get to their cars.

CASINO: The casino area looks remodeled and I really like the ambiance here—has an energetic vibe.  But it’s crowded so I had trouble finding a blackjack table with open seats.

"First off I've stayed at the Tropicana before but in the Chelsea tower. I had a great experience the last time I was here. This time I stayed in the west tower and I felt like I was sleeping in a motel. First off,it took three tries to get into the room. Then I noticed the security lock on the door was the old fashioned slide lock. Then there was mold and rust on the ceiling and wall of the bathroom. The room needed a serious facelift. There was torn wallpaper, holes in the dresser where the previous tv was and the climate control was ancient.
Granted I could have asked for a new room but I was tired and didn't want to move. I did complain and they gave me a $50 food voucher and extended checkout.

"EDIT
9/6 - Responded to owners request to email hotel about experience. I have emailed and hope the hotel will rectify this horrible experience. Will update when they have responded.

9/6 Where do I begin, first do not stay here!!!!!! There is no service and it ruined a birthday weekend trip.

When we arrived in AC we were going to check-in early. Mind you getting to the lobby hotel is a maze in itself with no signage anywhere to tell you where to go. We get to the lobby and there's 20 people and two receptionists along with self check-in machines on the side. I decided to wait. We waited to find out that there was a $25 fee to do so. We thought okay whatever let's do it and we asked if the room we reserved was ready and she said no housekeeping didn't get to it and you'll have to wait until 3pm. So we decided to wait for our room and came back at 3pm. We got our room  and it was not ready. Stains on the pillow cases and sheets and the bathroom with visible hairs everywhere. We called housekeeping 4x and each time they emphasized that requests take up to an hour to be completed. I said weird huh because I've been calling since 3pm and it's 7pm and nothing has been done. So I decided to call expedia for a refund. Expedia gets a manager called Jamal to help us and he says there is the same room ready and clean. So we trusts him and make the change just to find out the room is in the back of the hotel and even dirtier than the first. I had to go back downstairs and request our original room with the view and I would go to the store and buy cleaning supplies myself. The front desk manager was extremely helpful and so nice and helped fixed the situation. I have the emphasized SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE HELPFUL!. And when we moved back to the room it was finally being serviced and cleaned. However, it did take them until 8:30pm to have this completed. They did service the room the next day but at this point the trip was ruined and we checked out.

Save yourself the hassle and go elsewhere.  There's no entertainment, the casino here was dead, and the atmosphere just scummy. We ended up spending most of the following day at the ocean hotel and wished we would have just booked there.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleE9maWtnRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tropicana+Atlantic+City/@37.5346621,-86.6444706,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89c0ee64503d341f:0x5ae59bb688f27ccb!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.3523692!4d-74.4445618!16zL20vMDVnNXJt?hl=en",ChIJHzQ9UGTuwIkRy3zyiLab5Vo,Hotel,1.0,Tropicana Atlantic City,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuWlztpZVEcueAWl4UIaQ06e8haKPVR3vNy2r1=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"My policy is to only post positive reviews. So Atlantic City is a tough one for me. I decided to post because even though the streets around the Casino area are rough around the edges it's a place you should probably visit at least once and decide for yourself. The city has a ""once was glamorous"" feel, but now seems neglected and in need of a Facelift (see pics).
The Tropicana itself seems well managed and trying to bounce back from the pandemic.  The building is older, but my room was fine. Only a few of the restaurants are open and one inside pool.
The ventilation system allowed a hint of cigarette smell you find at casinos.  It seems if you stayed inside the building you could forget the neglected vibe outside.

"We have been staying at the Tropicana In Atlantic City for over 20 years.  This will be our last stay at the property.  From check in to check out we have never been treated so poorly. The resort is in bad shape. It isn’t ADA compliant as handrails are missing in the elevators and everything was dirty, as seen in the photos we posted.  At check in we were assigned a room that wasn’t clean.  There were potato chips all over the floor and the sheets were stained and gross with shoe prints all over the sheets.  We were assigned a new room, but it wasn’t much better.  There were boogers and blood wiped on the walls, the curtains had holes and the paint was peeling off the walls and headboards.  We had three guests and two towels.  When we requested more towels, housekeeping said we were only allowed two per room.  Two towels for three guests?  Housekeeping never came to our room to empty the trash or make the beds or collect old towels.  The next day we had to call housekeeping to get towels. I called back two hours later, and the gentlemen told me “Yeah, I have your slip right here” and then hung up on me.  The towels never came.  The only time housekeeping came to our room was to rush us to checkout.  By the third day the toilet stopped flushing properly and we had to use the casino restrooms. The hallway during our stay was disgusting and dirty.  The manager on duty couldn’t be reached.  Ceasar’s claims they’ve invested 400 million dollars in upgrades, but you will not see any of it in the Trop.

"Pros: The hotel itself is great. Kiosk’s located throughout the hotel allow the guests to check out really easily. Great food and entertainment options. Valet is $35 and you get your car back in under 10 minutes. Fireworks at night. Great casino.

Cons: Check in desk had 2 staff members for a line of 15+ groups needing to check in. Kiosks would redirect you to the check in desk. From waiting in line to finally getting my room keys was about 45 minutes. Not all the rooms have a nice view but it’s give in take: view of a parking garage but located next to a lot of dining/shopping options. The room was fairly dirty. During COVID it would be nice to have a little extra cleaning. Especially with the $35 a night “resort fee” that is charged. Trash left from the prior guest, stains on the sheets, hair in the drain, oily hair dryer, stains on the wall, and dusty room should not be an acceptable condition. Water or drain from bathroom sink had a funny smell. Umbrella rental is $20 for the beach-you can buy an umbrella for that much at one of the souvenir stands off the boardwalk.

Five minutes before show time, we got a call telling us the employee was sick and if we’ll stick around for and hour and a half for someone else to come in.  We declined and was told we’d get our $299 refunded.  The casino itself was nice, clean and not as noisy as the Hard Rock Casino (playing loud music 24/7).

"I just want to make sure, that my review will be about the hotel, not casino. Casino is actually nice and big, so you will have a lot of fun there. Let me start with the reason why we stood in Trop. It was our anniversary and we wanted to go to see our favorite DJ in Harrah’s. We are reward members, so we get comp rooms in both of these hotels plus Caesars, unfortunate all the rooms were sold out a months before our stay, so we decided to stay in Tropicana for our first time. We didn’t know, that the tower, that we picked was not renovated. We paid almost $400 for one night stay and we got old room with dirty chairs, broken safe and alarm clock, broken light in the bathroom and dirt all over. You can see it on the pictures. We called to the reward center and lady just forgot about us on the phone, so we went downstairs to see what was our options. We were ready to pay extra just to move to the nicer room. Lady in the reception helped us, she moved us to a suite in the same tower with no additional charge, but despite everything a new room wasn’t better than the previous one. Suite also was old, couches with stains, broken things all over, but we were happy about working safe and comfy beds. So my biggest advice, check the towers before stay, if you are not sure, call them and ask. Or better stay in Harrahs or Caesars for chipper and with renovated rooms.  2 stars for trying to resolve our issue and a good custom service.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaVByTlN3EAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tropicana+Atlantic+City/@37.5346621,-86.6444706,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89c0ee64503d341f:0x5ae59bb688f27ccb!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.3523692!4d-74.4445618!16zL20vMDVnNXJt?hl=en",ChIJHzQ9UGTuwIkRy3zyiLab5Vo,Hotel,2.0,Tropicana Atlantic City,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMilevuxXE4c6C0xCVfmhbUABul1OmbXtdgcy1h=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

Very nice casino..... very nice location only thing I didn't like was that I had 100 celebration credit for my diamond status so I got dinner on Saturday evening and thinking I could get  something and heat it up in microwave like any other casino I've stayed at has microwaves but no had no microwave so had to use hair dryer to heat up food both times and wasn't great.  Plus room where stayed in at room above and next door was very loud kept up all night long... Machines was tighter than Fort Knox for the weekend when they had a promotional weekend flight come in. If wanted to waste 2500 on tight machines could've stayed in cherokee and not had just a ok time. You would think they would have gave some promo cash away to guest also.

"I feel the biggest pro for Trop is that it is one of the best casinos for food options. Lots of different types of places like Chickie & Pete's, Palm, Carmine's, etc. The casino is decent and clean although my wife was disappointed with no Monopoly or goldfish slots (that we saw).

The room we had was pretty outdated but spacious. You can hear people next door, at least from the room we had.

We waited probably 25 mins in line Friday early evening (6:30pm) to check in. The self check-in didn't work for us so we then had to wait for a person which was another line. Expect to wait, especially on the weekend. The only major con was leaving Sunday. The parking garage was backed up all the way to the top. It was crazy. Probably close to an hour to get out.

All said, I still feel it is one of the best options in Atlantic City. It's an option for us now that it is Caesar's Rewards.

We spent the day at the cabana five pool deck bar.  It was beautiful. Food was good and service was ok.  Too many guests, not enough waitresses.

"For entertainment and dining this place is great, but do NOT stay in the West tower unless you're trying to save a few bucks.

Entertainment: Casino is vast, table games are plenty (enough) and the sportsbook is big.

Check in: they have many electronic kiosks, but they seemed clunky. Many people were having issues that required help, including us. They'll help did come quickly.

Rooms: We suggest not staying in West. Beds were okay. Bathroom is big. But the walls were scuffed/marked like a children's playroom. There is no carpeting, just vinyl floor which makes it a bit cold, (and more importantly louder above you.) If you do get a West tower room, request as far from the elevators as possible (you want the last two digits of your room number to be as high as possible, definitely above 25).

If you love 80s bathroom fixtures, and showers that whistle like tea kettles, then you'll love West. Haha.

Do not even think of trying to get an elevator near checkout time. After waiting five minutes, we took the stairs from the 45th floor and there were so many taking the stairs you'd think it was an evacuation.

Not a horrible room, and it was a few bucks cheaper, but had we'd known, we definitely would've paid more to be anywhere except West.

Parking: Extremely reasonable at only $10 for Saturday and Sunday night, and our check-in gave us a $5 voucher. So $5 total for 2 days of parking? Fabulous.

"The appearance of this hotel is great but I hope you don’t have to call the front desk. You have to call for any towels, to have your room clean, etc….. the wait times to call are greater than 5 minutes. The room with the lights and suites above was very good for the conference, thermostat just right, screens beside the stage large but speakers hang in front of them. Conference food was absolutely lacking any taste or creativity. Vegetarian option was pasta with a can of warmed tomato sauce dumped on top.
Hotel staff was very nice. The bathrooms were staffed with people for the conference area and were kept exceptionally clean… I mean SPOTLESS! Overall, it’s an OK hotel but needed more staff. We were there for 6 days and wasn’t able to get a cart for the luggage when we arrived or left.
The location of the hotel seems good considering the proximity to BWI airport. You have to walk through the Casino to get to more food and the choices are slim. Vegetarian options were a negative.

I stayed two nights, and found myself having to go to the restaurants in the casino for more to drink than the two complimentary mini bottles of water they give you, and one bottle of ginger ale was 5 dollars. I guess i should’ve expected nothing less, but the food and restaurants all seemed the same. The food they offer at luckies you can find at orchid kitchen which is also the envivo restaurant in one. I expected since the restaurants are listed as separate entities that they would be separate but its not. I was looking forward to staying here but I am extremely disappointed. Imagine cutting into a beautiful extravagant looking cake just to find out its made out of rice krispie treats.

The walk-in shower was a nice touch.  The casino was - a place to eat your money.  But we enjoyed ourselves.  We ate at David's restaurant once for dinner, and twice for breakfast.

"This review is about the hotel itself. Big pluses it's location (less than 40 minutes drive from DC) and direct connection to the casino and just 3 minutes walk to the center of the shopping mall. The room decor is pretty nice, they are clean and have ample of amenities (supplemental coffee, towels and so on). The staff is attentive (some reviews mentioned that staff were rude - nothing like that here). Check in and check out was a breeze. So, why 4 stars? I get used to having minibar - here a fridge but no drinks. Also a little bit late check in time - past 3PM. Overall it was a darn good time. And finally couple technical details - hotel charges around $15 resort fee (worth it - the spa is nice) and it's $150 hold for accidental fee (some people counted it as ""erroneous charge"".",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvcXZTMGNBEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Live!+Casino+%26+Hotel+Maryland/@35.8076728,-90.2479862,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89b7e3e744d116a9:0xa87434c1ecc1bc43!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.1577546!4d-76.7268883!16s%2Fm%2F0gmdn3v?hl=en",ChIJqRbRROfjt4kRQ7zB7ME0dKg,Casino,4.0,Live!

"The newly open LIVE! Casino & Hotel. I booked this for a one night staycation and wanted to give it a shot.

We knew construction was still ongoing, so finding the entrance from the garage was a bit confusing but the best level to park on was P1 on the far side away from the Casino itself because this took you to the backside of the Casino which is where they have the new entrance for the Hotel. The moment you walk in to the hallway, you see the Gelato place and the gift shop all next to David's (the hotel restaurant). You honestly forget you were in the Live! Casino itself just a few seconds ago. The check-in staff was very attentive and helpful in finding our reservations and getting us on our way; the only bad part was I expected a $20 free play but because I had already gotten this credit a few years ago, they didn't give it to me.

We had our unit on the 8th floor for a King Suite with a bathtub and shower. It was a very spacious master suite, with a huge bathroom. The toilet and shower each had a separate glass door unit with a double vanity. The room had huge fantastic glass windows with a view to the Costco, still cool overall. The downside was the sound-proof of the room; we heard the planes outside since we were on the BWI runway side and also housekeeping having large conversations in the hallway sounded like they were inside our own room. I also was disappointed that they did not give hand soap (at least the little bars) for you to use. Also, the pillows were not what I expected in a luxury suite, not that comfortable.

The Keurig coffee machine was a nice plus to have in the room, along with an iron and ironing board. The attention to detail in having robes was also nice; the large screen TV was great (w/ plenty of channels and ability to link with your streaming apps). The nice touch of having a touch pad with your name was cool; it also has a built-in app for white noise which was helpful. Finally, having a couch (not that comfy), coffee table and office desk were nice pluses.

In regard to the Spa and Fitness center, we went down to see the Fitness center and overall were impressed with the equipment (mainly aerobics, but nice smith machines, kettle and dumbbells). We didn't see inside the Spa area but it looked very spacious. Otherwise, we went down to the Casino itself and played.

For the price we paid for a King suite, we expected a bit more (ie. some extras included). But definitely worth a shot!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJazlMaWh3RRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Live!+Casino+%26+Hotel+Maryland/@35.8076728,-90.2479862,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89b7e3e744d116a9:0xa87434c1ecc1bc43!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.1577546!4d-76.7268883!16s%2Fm%2F0gmdn3v?hl=en",ChIJqRbRROfjt4kRQ7zB7ME0dKg,Casino,4.0,Live!

"We were visiting from out of town and we wanted to try out a new restaurant and check out a casino for the first time so we went here (we also ended up checking out Horseshoe Casino on another night and I would prefer Live! over Horseshoe if I gambled since it was more crowded and more tables going on at Live!). The main reason we visited was I have seen Bobby Flay on the cooking channel so wanted to try out his burger palace.
We did not gamble but we walked around the casino before and after dinner at BBP. This casino is also a hotel. A 4-star hotel. It is located in Hanover which really worked out for us since it is right next to the largest mall in Maryland - Arundel Mills. Quick walk from the mall to the casino.
We saw hundreds of slot machines and some table games going on like blackjack, poker, roulette, craps, etc. and playing the slots and table games range from 1 cent to a couple hundred dollars as far as what you can bet per slot or table. They did have a high betting area as well. I think it was at least $50 each bet but not 100% sure; we did not walk in there. In the main casino area, I saw video themed slots from dragons, anime, Simpsons, etc. Musicians and bands come here to perform such as Gladys Knight and Dwight Yoakam so check it out if you are in the area and want to go to a special event.
The bathrooms in the casino were clean. Everything was stocked with toilet paper, soap, paper towels, etc.
There are other restaurants/places to eat at that have American, Asian, seafood, and Italian dishes. There are a lot of casual places and a fine dining option. Go to the casino website to check out those options. There are TVs in this casino to watch sports on such as Sportscenter, baseball games, football games, etc. They had a Live! Casino gift shop as well. We didn't walk in there but it was big enough to get a souvenir with their logo on it, cigarettes, snacks, or whatever you wanted from there.
There was plenty of free parking. They also offer valet parking.
It was cool to go to a casino and have that experience but I am not sure we will be back again unless we were with a group of people who wanted to go or we chose to try out one of the other restaurants.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwOGJMMV9RRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Live!+Casino+%26+Hotel+Maryland/@35.8076728,-90.2479862,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89b7e3e744d116a9:0xa87434c1ecc1bc43!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.1577546!4d-76.7268883!16s%2Fm%2F0gmdn3v?hl=en",ChIJqRbRROfjt4kRQ7zB7ME0dKg,Casino,4.0,Live!

"The rooms are very modern and clean. There is a very nice hiking trail across the road sponsored by the hotel. A few things annoyed me. The casino allows smoking on the casino floor. The smell permeates into the restaurants, the gym and the hotel lobby.  In the room the heating/ventilation system sounds like a car ending. The bathroom fan is loud and does not have an off switch. The pool closes at 8 pm.

I'm not a fan of casinos but went to visit one of the restaurants and play a few dollars in the slots.  We always set an amount that we're willing to pay for a few hours of entertainment and that's all we spend.  It's our own game of how long will it take to lose this amount to the house.  In this case it was not nearly as much fun as it use to be.  The slots are 100% video games and everyone in our group felt like we were just spectators watching the games play themselves with our money.

"Got an awesome deal from Groupon for 1 night. We arrived at 6pm, free valet, were quickly checked in, and down enjoying the pool by 7pm where we wound down with a drink and a swim. Afterwards we showered, had some delicious appetizers at Guy Fieri’s then hit the casino floor  for a few hours before calling it a night. The beds are so comfy I didn’t feel my partner move all night. We just woke up and had an amazing breakfast at GF’s and are packing up before heading back down to enjoy the pool for a couple more hours before we hit the road for our next destination.
Few complaints: the parking. Your options are valet and waiting or self-parking outside the casino and making the trek up to your room. It is a bit slow moving process if you choose valet. Also, the mini fridges are packed with items that will get charged to your room if removed. They don’t leave you any space for you own items that need to be refrigerated.

"Absolutely recommend this resort! Beautiful decor and VERY friendly staff. Our room, a suite, was appropriately sized and fun to be in, also was able to check in 1.5 hours early so that was also very sweet to the price deal. The pool i recommend going early if enjoying adults only type of time, by 2-3pm lots of kiddos around. Bistecca was SUPER delicious and wait staff was very friendly and attentive. The live band playing last night 8/12 was jamming pretty well, i didnt stick around to give a full listen though. The cabanas were amazing to utilize, you also get to use the pool before/after checkout so thats a plus. Only gripes would be: unless you valet, theres no separate parking for the hotel, so you either walk thru the casino(which is probably designed on purpose) or walk around the outside, about a 5 min walk. Also, be prepared if going/leaving during peak times as your mixed in with regular casino goers so you may end up in the back of the lot. Secondly, theres not a lot of communication; in terms of staff to staff and promoting. Know before you go, the ONLY place to ACTUALLY get breakfast is Fieri's kitchen (other pption is a starbucks) unless you pay attention to the changing directory sign, you have no indication thats it for breakfast.

"Small casino compared to other ones I’ve been to (Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods). We stayed for a night in the Center Suite as a mini getaway from home.

They allowed us to check-in early, which was nice, especially since my husband wanted to take my toddler to the pool. Toddler had fun in the pool, but besides that there wasn’t much to do for the little one.
Ate dinner at one of the restaurants on the casino floor and then spent rest of the evening in the room watching tv (not much option). Ordered room service for breakfast the next day before we went home. There was nothing special about it and coffee had a horrible cleaning supply taste to it. Pretty expensive especially since 18% gratuity was included in the room service bill

"Peaceful place to stay, rooms are a little stuffy no matter how much you adjust the thermostat, it does not work. Gorgeous scenery. The rooms are nice and clean, and the staff is friendly however, for the amount of money charged for the stay the in room amenities could be much better. There's a wet bar as well as snacks such as nuts, pretzels, etc. DO NOT TOUCH them because you will be charged significantly! Don't even accidentally knock over a can of pretzels or you will be charged as it is weight sensitive. There is no microwave or refrigerator for personal use. You can rent a refrigerator for $26.50 per day. I believe that there is an option to rent the microwave as well. When checking out there are several additional charges such as a $12 food charge, $27.75 beverage charge, a $75 service charge, and another charge for $75 that says other. None of these charges were discussed prior to or during check in. It's evident that this place is about getting their money but, my husband and I enjoyed ourselves.

Stayed at hotel. Room was very nice and clean. Bed and pillows comfortable.

Bisteka restaurant was nice. Need reservations. People dressed nice.. Make sure to tell server 1/2 or full plate. The half was enough. The calamari was excellent! Lightly breaded. Two free small glasses of champagne for my daughter's birthday!
Noodle place was awesome as well. No reservations. See bento box photo. Server was very nice.

"Place is very nice. Rooms are all updated and very clean. Would have given it 5 stars but....

Took forever to get our rooms.

Food selections are very limited. Food staff seems very disorganized and it takes a long time to get served even when it is empty. But food was very good once it arrived, a half hour later.

No live music or bar/entertainment venues. Not like the Hard Rock Casinos.  It is basically just a Casino.

Pool is very crowded and open to outside guests, non-hotel guests, therefore they take all the seats and nothing is left for hotel guests. Very strange policy, and they yell at you if you sit in the coach area. What are you to do when there are no other seats available. Very odd.

The design of the building is attractive. The location in the mountains and the lake in front are picturesque. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was quite busy. The grounds and building were clean. The one negative that stood out to me was the lack of staff. Having a long wait in line to get a rewards card and difficulty in finding a drink waitress. There are plenty of slot machines and table games. The outside music venue looked great.

"I stayed here for Valentine's Day weekend. The hotel was beautiful. We stayed in a king suite. It was top notch. The room was really nice and spacious. There one thing that I did not like about the hotel was that they had no refrigerator in the room. Ice machines were available though. The service was nice. The bell guy Bob was really nice. He bought all of my luggage up to my room and put everything away for me. I was amazed about the hospitality here. When valet bought me my car, they had my heated seats on for me. I like that the people at the hotel care about you. My bathroom was huge with his/ her sinks. My husband and I could fit in the shower together. I had a mini bar in my room.

"Since I don't have photos from the night, here's a card I made for my mom. I took her here for her 50th birthday since some of the other plans I had for her fell through during the pandemic. I should have chosen this first! She loves to gamble and we had so much fun. She really enjoyed herself. I think they did a good job making it a safer place for indoor entertainment; everyone was masked and spaced. My only suggestion would be wipes available for the slots(although I'm not sure the erosive damage this could cause) and periodic hand sanitizing stations.

"We stayed here last week in the King Suite. The room was 5 stars without a doubt. The hotel itself wasn't too bad either. The only complaint I have is the smell of cigarette smoke right when you walk in which is coming from the casino. The restaurants are overpriced and aren't that great. However, the food from room service is extremely good and reasonably priced. We ended up getting snowed in which was a bit of a bummer for our trip. Unfortunately due to the storm the tvs weren't working either. Luckily we were leaving the next day so it wasn't too bad.

"I've stayed at a lot of Marriotts because of business trips in the past 10 years. They usually don't fall below a certain standard, but it seems in this case they did.

The rooms were pricey and we had booked a room with 2 queen beds and they gave us a room with a king and a sofa bed. Now you might think of this as an upgrade if you had a couple booking the room, but this was for 3 people and getting a sofa bed when you have paid for a queen. When i mentioned this in the app, they said they would fix it the next day and they did, and they have us the room right next to ours which made for a very easy transfer through the connecting door, which is what raised my review from 1 star to 2.

I suspect they changed our booking because they were having a convention and needed the room but this isn't an acceptable reason.

Other things that bothered me were the cleanliness of the rooms. I attached a couple of photos showing what our floor was like in the first room and the dirt inside the coffee maker. In both rooms, the coffee makers were terrible with one even having hair in it.

Finally it saddens me to see a sad attempt to look progressive with 3 places to charge an electric car. 2 Tesla spots of which 1 was it of order and 1 for non Tesla electric cars.

If you want to add electric car charging to your hotel add 10 spots not have a token amount and not even functional

I think they rely on the event housing so much they don't really care about their amenities is status of their rooms so much. Because every night we were there they had all least 2 events going on.

For the price and the quality, might as well just stay in mystic close to everything. I don't think I will be going back to this specific Marriott.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaUw3MWtBRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mystic+Marriott+Hotel+%26+Spa/@38.7443311,-85.7655643,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89e60be7308c15e1:0xffacd6173589b17a!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d41.3653601!4d-72.0257321!16s%2Fg%2F1tdwr3dd?hl=en",ChIJ4RWMMOcL5okRerGJNRfWrP8,Hotel,2.0,Mystic Marriott Hotel & Spa,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgKyXtJwtGqJai-h__h-flhY-QADcc-6wf1Dk3=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"I had high expectations for this property based on its category and price range. It did not deliver in accordance to its value and how it was advertised. The room I was initially given was not properly cleaned. There were clear signs that the fitted sheet was not laundered. I had to switch rooms, which unfortunately was a downgrade, and there were cleanliness issues in that room as well. The room amenities were lacking, which again is surprising based on category and price. The spa was closed, as well as the hot tub. Those items played a big role in my decision, so I was quite disappointed to find out they were closed. Why didn't the price and category reflect these changes. They are being very misleading, and that's enough to turn me away from Marriott properties. My main concern is they are still advertising as if they have everything together during these times and are charging inflated prices. I am highly upset I did not receive what was expected and now feel like my money put into this property is a major loss. The only thing that was nice is the customer service of the front office staff. The lady taking our breakfast room service order was a little off putting. There was a mistake made with my order. I called to let her know but she seemed upset at me for letting her know their mistake. It was corrected, but her tone was unsettling. The toast was overcooked and stale.
