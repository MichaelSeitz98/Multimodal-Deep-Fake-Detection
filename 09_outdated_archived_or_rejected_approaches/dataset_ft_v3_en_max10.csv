This could be the worst casino buffet I've ever had. They had prime rib but it was limited to one slice at a time and The Carver would only cut it paper thin. But informed me you could come back as often as you like. Not sure it really mattered because the prime rib was so dry and tough.  The food in the trays look like it had been sitting there for days.

"I was very disappointed.  My stay lasted no more than 20 minutes.

When I arrived, the Clerk was disinterested.  I was told to park in the ""school"" parking lot.  What I was NOT told was that someone needed to be there to unlock the gate.  When I pulled up, the lot was locked.  I had to drive around the block to get back into the hotel, to inform the Clerk it was locked, for one of the bellboys to say someone needed to meet me out there to unlock the fence.  I then drove around the block again and was able to get into the parking lot.

Upon entering my hotel room, I was in disbelief.  I understand this is a historic building, but was surprised to find that to them, historic meant outdated, dingy, dirty, and simply un-maintained.

I rented a 2 bedroom suite.  The kitchen was in a room off of 1 bedroom, while the bathroom was in the other bedroom.  So, to use the restroom, you had to enter the other guest's room.  If you wanted to watch TV, you had to go into the bedroom with the kitchen.  The kitchen was outdated.  The kitchen sink did not have handles and was filthy.  The fridge didn't shut unless you slammed it.  I understand now why their website has minimal photos of their rooms.

There is no AC or central air.  The wall heaters were on when I arrived.  I turned them all off.  To cool my room, I opened the windows.  I was on the 4th floor and had no screen on my large windows.   A loose nail was just sitting on my window ledge.  I called down to the front desk and had them bring up 2 fans, which I put in my windows to attempt some form of cool air in my suite.

There were dead flies and bees on the floor, on the heating units, and in the windowsills.  A live grasshopper was on my bed.  Again.  I was on the 4th floor.

The bed in the room with the TV was broken.  When my guest sat on it, I truly thought she was going to flip off the bed as it sank so far down, so quickly.

After maybe 20 minutes total, I could no longer justify the extreme expense of my room ($630 for two nights).  When I went down to the Clerk, I asked for a manager, and she came up quickly.  I briefly explained my concerns and without hesitation, she said she would cancel my room.  While I was pleased with this resolution, it seemed odd that the immediate response was simply to remove me from the hotel rather than find a more acceptable room.  This leads me to believe this is a common occurrence.

Overall, I would give this hotel 0 stars if I could.

Looks like a well maintained​ golf course. It has a nice clubhouse and OK RV park for peaple traveling. I'm not a golfer but I stayed at the RV park.  I saw how well they kept up the golf course.  I stayed in the RV park for two months.  They did not seem good at managing the RV park and at times the management didn't know who was even there.  At times they didn't even dump the trash cans. They sometimes went days without doing this and only dumped them oafter they started overflowing. The golf course was well kept but there was lots of weeds around the RV spaces.  Electrical is included but daily space rates seem high for what they have to offer. This was NOT a dog friendly RV park. They have very poor WiFi service.

"Thanks for the great stay Hyatt Eden!!  A group of us drove from Winnipeg to Minneapolis to catch a Vikings game. We were concerned this hotel was too far away but it didn’t turn out to be an issue. It’s easy enough to drive around the city. Maybe took us half hour to get downtown. The Harley store, Target and Menards are close to the hotel so that was nice.

The rooms are big!! King Bed comfy, shower pressure great and lots of hot water!!!  Pull out sofa.
Could have easily had 4 adts share the king room.

Front staff check in was pleasant. They didn’t realize we were all traveling together so they ended up placing us on different floors. But that was our fault for not speaking up.
We also didn’t speak up about having a room away from the elevators. It was annoying to be woken up super early from guests checking out and kids running up and down the hallway etc. By the elevator. Things yah just don’t think about sometimes.

"I finally got a chance to check this place out. Most of the barcades are in Charlotte so it's nice to have one close to home. I went on a Thursday night which is ""guys night"" and was welcomed as soon as I walked in, both the owners and the guests were very friendly. For Thursdays, about all games were free (at least for dudes) except for pinball, which were .50 a game. Normally it's $5 a person for unlimited play and pinball is $1.00 a game (ouch to $1.00 pinball!). There were maybe 6 to 12 people rotating in and out while I was there, so not crowded at all. Parking was abundant. It's about a 5 minute walk from Freeman's. Bar can turn cash to quarters or can give you quarters from your bar tab for a 10% surcharge. Bar had food and drinks at fair prices. There are 2 gender neutral restrooms. There are a few TV's playing sports and comic book movies and YouTube videos. Place was open until midnight on a weeknight which was cool. There was one tv hooked up to a Nintendo 64 with a pretty large assortment of games. There were a couple party/board games sitting near a table. There was a fairly large area for outdoor seating as well. I think what made this visit special was how friendly the owners and guests were, felt like you were just visiting old friends instead of strangers.

EDIT: Citycade did a reconfiguration and brought in a racing game, a shooting game, a beer pong game and a couple of pay to win games disguised as games of skill. I believe at this point they've gotten rid of the $5 cover entirely and just made the machines take quarters, which I think was a good move. Pinball is still a buck which is a bummer since there are better options out there for $.50 a game, but it's close to home at least and the price point isn't uncommon. Pinball seems maintained and Citycade has occasionally swapped out for different pins, which is nice. Bathrooms are always clean which is a plus. Only complaint is that sometimes it can get a bit hot in the building.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdmFxUllnEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/CityCade+Classic+Arcade+and+Pinball+Game+Bar,+Gastonia+NC/@35.2341215,-81.0537741,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8856c1b3a8efdad9:0xd240e10ee1ba3f55!8m2!3d35.2632135!4d-81.1797882!16s%2Fg%2F11j7k_xln2?hl=en",ChIJ2drvqLPBVogRVT-64Q7hQNI,Bar,5.0,"CityCade Classic Arcade and Pinball Game Bar, Gastonia NC",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOYNN5y6gNITGaKA6YxbJtiodU2YD_0tsylVxD=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

The pirate ship was fun. We didn't get to do the planetarium because.. let's face it. My 2 year old wouldn't sit through it. They have small live animals to check out too like a possum, snakes, parie dog and turtles. On the back side of the building there's pigs and sheeps. There's a trail with a pond and other things.

The main building is not super big but it has many interesting exhibitions and information, this is definitely the first stop; but then you have a beautiful farm (outdoor) with an old cabins and many other stations and animals that your kids will love.
In addition to it you can also walk-hike trough a small forrest that is also beautiful and a perfect opportunity to enjoy nature. There is a lot to do 👍

"SUPERB AUTHENTIC THAI in the Pittsburgh area, a short 15 min drive from downtown.  Cozy restaurant with no-touch menu, short and sweet. It looks a popular spot to locals of many persuasions. Takeout or sit in (I have done both), it’s simply excellent food. A FOODIE’S GEM.

Start with Fresh Rolls and Fried Eggplant, contrasting but complementary textures and sweet tangy sauces that wake up the palate (very much unlike the cliche peanut sauce in the run of mill Thai-style places.

Any of the curry entrees are very good, smooth well-balanced sauces; none of that pungent sugar-loaded curry so common in so-called Thai restaurants in this town.

My recommendation: Duck Curry, very crispy well seasoned perfectly cooked duck atop the smooth Red curry with bell peppers and cherry tomatoes, carefully balanced with two halves of lychee just enough to brighten the palate: Simply Wow!

Pair the curry with any of the Thai stir fry veggies.  I’m partial to the Hot Basil fry, extra veggies (natural sweetness of the fresh vegetables complemented with their brown sauce).

By the way, enjoy Thai food with a spoon rather than fork/knife. Spoon the curry or veggies on rice, mix, then enjoy. Spoon allows one to taste every drop of the sauce.

Great service!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlODVHZThBRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thai+Tamarind/@40.4840871,-80.119055,13z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8834f4f8d66dcee3:0x9f38b06e37d3f35a!8m2!3d40.4912195!4d-80.047499!16s%2Fg%2F1tgk18xd?hl=en",ChIJ485t1vj0NIgRWvPTN26wOJ8,Thai restaurant,5.0,Thai Tamarind,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBCJ7xZJb2Oc-U2O_F0O66mrgbpsgAXzPo61Wm=w150-h150-k-no-p,restaurant
"I live directly up the street from this place on Washington Ave and I have got to say that I am absolutely disappointed with their quality of food.  Today, I just recently ordered their Pad Kee Mao and it looked like someone chewed up the meal and spit it right back out into the carry out tray.  The noodles were overly soggy and mushed up like mashed potatoes.  The salad that comes with the Lunch looks as if someone cut out a large chunk from a piece of lettuce, threw it into the tray, and then decided to splash a little sauce on top of it.

I don't normally complain about food and most times I simply ignore the mistakes but I've been living in Bellevue for 3 years now and this incident has happened more than once.  A customer can only be patient so many times and then there comes a point where a enough is enough.  This restaurant will never receive my services ever again.  I don't know if it's the cook or the management but the quality of food is poor.  Years ago the food was much better. I'm not sure what happened between then and now.

If you want a quality restaurant for Thai food, go to Niky's Thai Kitchen.  I promise you, Niky's Thai Kitchen is the better choice.  Their food quality is suburb compared to Thai Tamarind, especially for the price you'll pay for it.

"I've stayed at a lot of Marriotts because of business trips in the past 10 years. They usually don't fall below a certain standard, but it seems in this case they did.

The rooms were pricey and we had booked a room with 2 queen beds and they gave us a room with a king and a sofa bed. Now you might think of this as an upgrade if you had a couple booking the room, but this was for 3 people and getting a sofa bed when you have paid for a queen. When i mentioned this in the app, they said they would fix it the next day and they did, and they have us the room right next to ours which made for a very easy transfer through the connecting door, which is what raised my review from 1 star to 2.

I suspect they changed our booking because they were having a convention and needed the room but this isn't an acceptable reason.

Other things that bothered me were the cleanliness of the rooms. I attached a couple of photos showing what our floor was like in the first room and the dirt inside the coffee maker. In both rooms, the coffee makers were terrible with one even having hair in it.

Finally it saddens me to see a sad attempt to look progressive with 3 places to charge an electric car. 2 Tesla spots of which 1 was it of order and 1 for non Tesla electric cars.

If you want to add electric car charging to your hotel add 10 spots not have a token amount and not even functional

I think they rely on the event housing so much they don't really care about their amenities is status of their rooms so much. Because every night we were there they had all least 2 events going on.

For the price and the quality, might as well just stay in mystic close to everything.

Really nice everything brand new really big but long-term price won’t work. We definitely will be going to the other trampoline places then to come here because of the prices. Arcade is over priced for what you can win. Which is like that almost everywhere. I do love that they have so many couches and lots of areas for the parents to sit and watch kids. Oh and you have to have non-grip socks and they don’t tell you that when you come in and they do not have prices for the Sox listed on their board either. They are three dollars a pair of socks and they don’t have any deals on them like if you buy multiple or a pack or anything to save money which is kind of crazy because if I knew beforehand I could’ve bought some online for way cheaper from somewhere else. I like that you have to wear a electronic wristband that has a green and red light to tell you when your time is up. Everything is very Clean because it is a brand new building and equipment.

"Great place, definitely glad to have it near us. Yes it costs more than Hang Time, but it has more to offer. Plus a bunch of couches and several massage chairs for adults.
At Hang Time I'm always worried about where my smaller kids are because you can't keep a good eye everywhere. Feels like it's for older kids and young adults with more trampolines for tricks.

What I like about The Hive it's good for kids of all ages. There's a tetherball with jumping around it. Two interactive video game screens that actually show their picture on screen as they jump, so fun!
Zip line, jumping basketball, targets, go carts (costs extra), the biggest bounce house/obstacle course I've ever seen. Regular trampolines too, rock wall, ninja warrior obstacles, slack line.

There are drinking fountains, but they're by the go carts (kind of annoying they're so far).
They also have bands to wear that have lights that change color when your time is up. They do have lockers as well.
Overall, we'll go again, but less frequently because of the cost.

"Spent several hours reading my book while my 11 and 14-year-old boys got plenty of exercise. (Adults don’t have to pay if they don’t plan on jumping) Many clean and comfortable couches to choose from for parents who want to relax and lots of fun activities for kids of all ages. I saw many small children and big children playing on many different things and it’s big enough that nobody was getting in each others way.

"I've stayed here twice within the last year, the first time my room in the casino tower was a lot more run down and old than I am used to and I low key had an eerie feeling from the room I stayed in the first time. Maybe something happened there before I don't know, but I felt this odd coldness/a feeling that made me uneasy. I was hesitant to stay here but I decided to book again since I was only here for a couple days.

My 2nd visit this past week was decent. The hotel itself is older of course, but it gives the basic necessities. I was in the sky tower this time and it felt more updated than the casino tower?

Heating/cooling system worked perfectly. I had a corner room which had a nice view of the city.

I would give this rating a lot lower for the incident that happened, but I will assume it was a rare occurrence where someone walks in your room without knocking. The woman Apologized, but I felt really uncomfortable because I could've been naked or in the shower. It was totally inappropriate, I messaged the concierge Ivy person thing and they apologized but never offered to do anything...

Water quality from the faucets were questionable, I ran the hot and cold and both looked heavy, see photo. But cleared up after I ran it for some time.

Shower ran well too. Water temp was well controlled. So everything else was fine with the room. Nothing extravagant, I just got a normal king size room.

Anyways, I like the convenience of the hotels location and how it's connected to the other, Silver Legacy, el Dorado, etc. We enjoy the arcade and circus shows too. Staff are friendly for the most part. They have a better food court now than they did 12 years ago, so there are improvements here and there.

I love that they still have a lot of old mixed with new. I love the history of the buildings and seeing that throughout the halls and rooms of the buildings. Please maintain the history  I think that's what really entices visitors too!

"Our experience here was awesome! My boyfriend and I did 'The Lost Ship' room. It was a Wednesday 7pm booking, so just the two of us took on the challenge without anyone else booking in. And we escaped with 90 seconds to spare!! Our guide, Captain Charles, did a fantastic job introducing the room to us with this whole back story to set us up. If you pay close attention, there are clues in everything he's saying as well.

The room itself was the best part. It was actually several rooms all joined together and from the lobby you had to figure out how to even enter the main room in the first place—super cool! I had never seen anything like that before. The puzzles were also really well thought out and interesting, using logic and problem solving (not at all abstract or random). Of all the escape rooms I have done, I would say that this has been the best experience I have had because of the attention to detail in the room, the quality of the puzzles, and the experience of being able to solve it with just the two of us.

The room is actually designed for at least 6 people, because it would have been helpful for others to take on and simultaneously solve riddles in the room.

"This place is amazing.  Talk about taking yourself back in time for a minute you feel like you are in Germany.  They open at 5pm for dinner only.  You drive down this  dark road, and you would never know there was a parking lot and a restaurant from the top of the road.
You go inside from the parking lot on a top level,  down a flight of  stairs is the restaurant.  They do have an elevator for handicap.
Once below it's amazing.  It's small probably about 30 tables, wooden walls, and all decorated with Germany memorabilia.
I was so excited to try this place the last time I had German food was in Germany 20 plus years ago.  I still remember what that tasted like.
There was 2 waitress serving and taking orders. Lisa was our waitress.  She is such a nice lady,  and definitely knows her menu,  and has worked their for a long time.  I ordered the German beer on tap it was very light, clear, and refreshing. My other half Bayrischer Schweinebraten it was a tender slow roasted pork shoulder.  I tasted the dish and it was amazing.  Very tender and with lots of flavor.  It was not sliced it was more like chunk pork. His side was the sliced apples.  I have never tried apples sliced fresh, in a cinnamon sauce.  I wish you could order this by the pint or quart to take home.  Amazing!
I ordered Jägerschnitzel which was delicious with the cream white wine sauce, and mushroom.  The sauce was so good I asked for a little more sauce. The pork meat was tender, and a nice slice. My sides was potato pancakes oh my goodness hold the fork these were not greasy at all.  I put the sour cream and applesauce on the potato cakes. My other side I was wanting to try was the German potato salad.  It was good, completely traditional,  but not my favorite for my taste buds. Before dinner you have a choice of soup or salad.  I definitely tried the soup which was really good the traditional red cabbage soup.
I can't wait to come back to try more dishes.
For dessert if you have room definitely order the bread pudding with the warm whiskey sauce.  You will want to make room for this dessert.
We were getting ready to leave, they were closing, and they were so nice they make everything fresh daily, and had extra apple and cherry turnovers. I had taken home 1 of each. The next day with a cup of coffee, warmed up,  very good.
I can't wait to come back!

"I want to begin by saying I really love the atmosphere. The tables are spaced out enough that there is not much noise and it’s easy to talk to your table. The interior decoration is also very beautiful. There is not much parking but I live close so I walked. The food was delicious but there were just enough weird things that made me give 4 instead of 5 stars. The bread and butter (which is its own appetizer) is OK but definitely not anything to write home about, the butter pat was cold so not easily spreadable. I ordered the cauliflower main dish with sauce and golden raisins knowing it would be lighter than a meat main. However, with the price of the dish, I was expecting a bit more than 1/4 of a cauliflower head for my main meal. I know inflation and prices are high but cauliflower? Seems they could’ve spared a bit more. Additionally the olive oil cake with rhubarb and strawberry ice cream was good but the ice cream stole the show! The cake itself was just ok and the rhubarb had not been sweetened enough to make it palatable, I ended up taking it off. The service was good but not great, we had a new server and she made a few missteps that ultimately would have cost our party money if we hadn’t spoken up (as opposed to slow service, etc). Overall, I definitely want to go back to the elm, i will just choose my dishes more carefully.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX1AyLVd3EAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Elm+Restaurant/@39.1611609,-86.7899909,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x886c6708d507ad07:0x637ac7c0df7ee644!8m2!3d39.1611609!4d-86.526319!16s%2Fg%2F11pctwtx_4?hl=en",ChIJB60H1QhnbIgRROZ-38DHemM,Restaurant,4.0,The Elm Restaurant,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoW89ePePoKhRoJQIukaMmy8uanpBy-oEo6kr-=w150-h150-k-no-p,restaurant

"Their burrito game is STRONG!! Putting chain restaurants to shame since opening their doors, this local gem serves up deliciously grande portions of authentic Mexican grub. I ordered the chorizo burrito which doubled as lunch and dinner due to its gigante status. It came with a side of chips and a tasty jalapeño ranch dressing for dipping. It would have paired beautifully with a cerzeva or two, but I was there for carry out lunch so I laid off the booze until I could come in for a dinner here. Fast service.

"First off I've stayed at the Tropicana before but in the Chelsea tower. I had a great experience the last time I was here. This time I stayed in the west tower and I felt like I was sleeping in a motel. First off,it took three tries to get into the room. Then I noticed the security lock on the door was the old fashioned slide lock. Then there was mold and rust on the ceiling and wall of the bathroom. The room needed a serious facelift. There was torn wallpaper, holes in the dresser where the previous tv was and the climate control was ancient.
Granted I could have asked for a new room but I was tired and didn't want to move. I did complain and they gave me a $50 food voucher and extended checkout.

"EDIT
9/6 - Responded to owners request to email hotel about experience. I have emailed and hope the hotel will rectify this horrible experience. Will update when they have responded.

9/6 Where do I begin, first do not stay here!!!!!! There is no service and it ruined a birthday weekend trip.

When we arrived in AC we were going to check-in early. Mind you getting to the lobby hotel is a maze in itself with no signage anywhere to tell you where to go. We get to the lobby and there's 20 people and two receptionists along with self check-in machines on the side. I decided to wait. We waited to find out that there was a $25 fee to do so. We thought okay whatever let's do it and we asked if the room we reserved was ready and she said no housekeeping didn't get to it and you'll have to wait until 3pm. So we decided to wait for our room and came back at 3pm. We got our room  and it was not ready. Stains on the pillow cases and sheets and the bathroom with visible hairs everywhere. We called housekeeping 4x and each time they emphasized that requests take up to an hour to be completed. I said weird huh because I've been calling since 3pm and it's 7pm and nothing has been done. So I decided to call expedia for a refund. Expedia gets a manager called Jamal to help us and he says there is the same room ready and clean. So we trusts him and make the change just to find out the room is in the back of the hotel and even dirtier than the first. I had to go back downstairs and request our original room with the view and I would go to the store and buy cleaning supplies myself. The front desk manager was extremely helpful and so nice and helped fixed the situation. I have the emphasized SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE HELPFUL!. And when we moved back to the room it was finally being serviced and cleaned. However, it did take them until 8:30pm to have this completed. They did service the room the next day but at this point the trip was ruined and we checked out.

Save yourself the hassle and go elsewhere.  There's no entertainment, the casino here was dead, and the atmosphere just scummy. We ended up spending most of the following day at the ocean hotel and wished we would have just booked there.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleE9maWtnRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tropicana+Atlantic+City/@37.5346621,-86.6444706,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89c0ee64503d341f:0x5ae59bb688f27ccb!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.3523692!4d-74.4445618!16zL20vMDVnNXJt?hl=en",ChIJHzQ9UGTuwIkRy3zyiLab5Vo,Hotel,1.0,Tropicana Atlantic City,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuWlztpZVEcueAWl4UIaQ06e8haKPVR3vNy2r1=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"The RV park is small, well maintained, right on the water, and the site we had included full hookups. I absolutely agree with other reviews that the road noise is significant and that site #14 is only appropriate for a smaller RV.  We were able to back into #14 with a 20' trailer, I cannot imagine doing it with anything larger. It seemed that several of the concrete pads were not level, we noticed an RV with both of its front tires off the ground after being leveled. We enjoyed kayaking but found strong and irregular currents in front of the PUD building. We didn't notice any real beach, but maybe the tides were off while we were there.

The apartment was very spacious and clean,to bedrooms and a set of bunk beds, it had everything you need such as laundry soap, condiments, utensils, plates etc. So we were able to grocery shop for the week.
When you go to the pool, the kiddie pool is not warm and there is an adult pool for night. The beach is beautiful but there is always a low tide so you will have to walk a little to get to the water.
The town is not fully developed, so don’t expect a Cancun experience but you will find authentic Mexican food when you drive into the town.

"Great place, semi family with a little adult on the side. Has walkout villas which we stayed in and condos. Villa -10 is personally owned and configured differently but has same layout as other villas. Huge tall living, large baths, large rooms. Lots of space inside. Sit on a Lawn chair and and do activities on the turf grass out back. They provide most everything but would recommend more toilet paper, sand chairs per person, shade if you want it.

We came for 4th of July weekend and our friends booked our Airbnb here at Las Palmas I love the resort entirely! First time in Puero Penasco! So walking from the Condo to the beach was just a few mins so close by the beach. Our view was amazing & breathtaking! The resort pools we absolutely loved and enjoyed. They have the kid family pool area which is impressive cause they have really cool slides and shallow area for littles. Plus offer his eats and antojitos while swimming and lounging. The resort has zero tolerance for partying too late and loud obnoxious ppl will be addressed or kicked out so I like that too.

"This is arguably the best sushi in Easton (maybe even the shore)! I've tried all the others and I keep coming back. The staff is friendly and always asks about my family when I come in alone. The wait for food is never long, even if the place is full. You can dine in at lunch and get back to work quick. The menu items consistently taste amazing and are prepared the same way everytime... there are no surprises, if you order an Olympic roll it's going to be amazing Every Single Time, and that surely can not be said for the other places in town. Some of my favorites are ""Amazing Tuna"" ""Jingle Bell"" ""Olympic"" ""Incredible"" and ""spicey crab"" but all of them are good. If you go between 12 and 4 the special is ""get 1 special roll and get a second at half off"".

Three 65 inch tvs in each space kept everyone entertained during our downtime. The room was clean, nice and spacious. The hotel itself was very clean and nice in all areas. The pool is nicer than average hotel pools featuring a shallow wading pool for small children and main pool with basketball hoop and a larger slide for older kids.

"Main takeaways: not worth the price, but the kids did have fun. The exhibit was small, very warm (no ac even in Summer), and the main thing is that the dinosaurs appear to be inflatable? And in very poor condition (missing teeth, hair and feathers missing in large patches, sections of the inflatable not working etc.) the lighting is also very low and odd. It seems designed to be scary and colorful maybe, instead of actually being able to see any detailing on the creatures. I paid $25 per person (including the kids) and you can see the exhibit in 15-20 minutes (reading all of the educational material). It just isn’t worth it.

The only reason this isn’t a 1 star or a complaint to the organization for a refund, is that the kids did have fun. The dinosaurs are touchable (probably why they are in such terrible condition). And there is an interactive coloring program at the end that is pretty good (but even that was glitchy.)",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa2NqSDJRRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dino+Safari+Boston:+A+Walk-Thru+Adventure/@42.9161377,-71.8822557,9z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e371a4e43be949:0xf28f02a7abf984e2!8m2!3d42.3597994!4d-71.0545357!16s%2Fg%2F11p676q92g?hl=en",ChIJSek75KRx44kR4oT5q6cCj_I,Exhibit,2.0,Dino Safari Boston: A Walk-Thru Adventure,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMujw1pvPz8j8jaU-OkcvqrIkqfnwxDMa6mHDxN=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"NOT WORTH THE COST!!!
Save your money, and use the $25 for something that is more than 10 mins long. Also for $75 we could have   had hours worth of fun some where else in the city rather than 10 mins.

Is it a fun experience for children ages 3 to 12, yes! If money is NOT a worry for you then go and enjoy yourself. Our child had a great time for the 15 mins. However, $25 for adults and children is absolutely ridiculous. At BEST this is should cost $12 for adults $5 for children.

The only reason they can get away with charging such an absurd price is because it is in Faneuil Hall.

"Very nice selection with a few issues: Many of the tanks are mislabeled; the fish are a different species or don't have a label at all. The short woman with the bangs is very rushed and careless when handling fish. She seems to be annoyed with questions and customers overall. All of the other employees, however, are friendly and care about where/how your fish will be living.

Aisles are a bit narrow, and I doubt they're ADA compliant. Salt water tanks are on the second floor, which is only accessible via stairs. Pond area is nice. The parking can be tricky, but it's mostly shaded.

"At best, I'm a novice at the aquarium hobby. I've been setting up an aquarium and navigating all the intricacies that comes with setting up a new aquarium. In doing so, a social media aquarium hobby group recommended the Austin Aqua Dome as a solid, local hub for hobbyists. During my visit, I was greeted and invited to ask any questions I might have.

The building calls back to the ""Keep Austin Weird"" idea in both supporting a local business *and* being a wonderfully unique shopping experience in offering an infinite collection of aquarium related materiel to purchase- from fresh water to salt/marine, from ponds, to desktop bowls and extravagant custom aquariums. My overall experience was akin to me being a kid going on a great field trip like a previous visitor mentioned in their review.

Though I am still waiting to introduce fish to my aquarium, I was able to have questions answered about different live plants suitable to my experience and want for the type of fish community I'll eventually be keeping. I was introduced to a myriad of different plant varieties and they had a wonderfully diverse set of options to choose from. I ended up purchasing 5 plants of two different kinds and a wonderful piece of prepared driftwood for my setup. I also bought a plant solution to introduce and maintain for my water that promotes growth. Finally, because I look to continue my business relationship with Austin Aqua Dome, I purchased a one year membership that will likely pay for itself as my odyssey into this passtime grows. High fives all around and I can't wait to go back again and, if my S.O. doesn't kill me, maybe start a 2nd aquarium in the near future!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNnZEbU5nEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Austin+Aqua-Dome/@30.229189,-97.7858588,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x8644b4caed938353:0xd15c7b293e7a71b1?hl=en",ChIJU4OT7cq0RIYRsXF6Pil7XNE,Tropical fish store,5.0,Austin Aqua-Dome,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzvTCZ1dR9jzbJqUaP3jWK9k5QhwuCKQhrCG9j=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"This review is really mostly about the showers. Haha. Stopped in the store here today during an epic journey through the Olympic peninsula. I was searching for places to shower and came across a trip advisor review from 8 years ago that said there were showers available for 75 cents.  After hiking around in the sea breeze and camping out, I really wanted a shower, so we decided to stop in and ask if they were available and luckily were pointed in the right direction. There is a single stall shower in a small room, it is self serve, you just need quarters. 4 minute showers available for $2.00, 5 for $2.50 6 for 3.00 and 7 for $3.50. The water got hot, the pressure was average.

"MOLD AND TERRIBLE HOUSEKEEPING!!! Front desk has great customer service. Kayla was very attentive and has great customer service. I stayed ten nights and housekeeping would show up every other day. I had to do my own bed, and take out my trash on the days that no one would show up. On the days that they showed up it was around 4 PM and in a bad mood. I talked to a manager by the name of Kyle three times and he did nothing about it. My shower was never cleaned even though I mentioned to the housekeeping lady that I had mold in the shower.

"You will miss your bed at home real quick! The only thing keeping me from giving a two star or worse rating was the fantastic customer service: front desk, housekeeping, and the breakfast attendant. Otherwise this Hilton-brand Hampton Inn and Suites is not worth the higher price point than many of the other options in Aberdeen and is way overdue for a refresh (maybe we can blame Covid-19). The colors and finishes in the lobby, halls and rooms are dinged, scuffed and just plain ugly. The king-sized bed in our non-suite room was caving in and needing replacement. When booking, be aware not all the rooms are like the pictures on the site, some are very plain with no kitchenette, just an awkward mini fridge and microwave by the desk in the room. No real dresser if you like to unpack just a small hutch with sticking drawers that the TV sits on. Pull out style love seat sofa seemed like a great option for the kids, but the window was very drafty and our son about froze the first night. The blankets were very thin waffle weave style. We asked for a second for the next night and he put on extra clothes and was okay. Not comfortable enough for an adult, he slept on it backwards, because even he could feel the metal. The bathroom was a good size which was nice for a family traveling with younger kids, but the bathroom fixtures were loose and the shower almost didn't work. The toilet took several flushes. The pillows in our room weren't the usual mixture of firm and soft (feather and polyfill as it turned out for here), but housekeeping brought us new ones when we inquired at the front desk during breakfast. The breakfast was quite good. Many choices, including an oatmeal area with fixings, plus other hot options, waffles, fresh fruit, yogurt, biscuits and gravy one morning and the next eggs and sausage patties. Coffee options were hot. Pool and hot tub area was small, but we had fun anyways. Pool towels were restocked regularly. Elevator floor became sticky one evening, but as we were in and out, right away they had it mopped I noticed. Again, great customer service that way. We also did laundry which was weirdly on the second floor off in the corner, kinda creepy, but washing and each dry cycle was just a dollar in quarters.

"Of all the hotels that I've stayed in my entire life, I can safely say, this is the most complete one yet. The rooms are so well planned. The separation of bedroom(1 tv here) and kitchen-and tv room(another tv here). The quality of the mattresses. The quality of the linen and the cleanliness. The stocked kitchen with cooking utensils and pots & pans. The safe in the closet. The quietness and the food offerings at the counter. And the value for the money can't be beat.

"I wish I could give this place a better rating but unfortunately I give it 2 stars.
Very crowded, we were only able to do 1 thing there.  Archery,  we stood in line for almost an hour to shoot 3 arrows 🏹.
Tried walking around a bit but unfortunately we couldn't really see or do much of anything. We luckily were able to buy a few souvenirs before being pushed out by a crowd of people, which was scary because I had my 2 year old in my arms.
We decided to leave after that and as we got to our vehicle only to realize we were blocked in at the overflow parking area. Our car and about 8 others were trapped for about a little over an hour because another car decided to block the only way out.
I and several others tried calling the only number provided for Evermore and were told the number doesn't exist. I sent my husband to the front gate to let them know the situation and no one came for 20 minutes then they just sat there looking at the car blocking the exit instead of trying to page the owner or calling a tow truck.
Luckily 2 groups in front of our cars were leaving and by that miracle they made an opening to let us all out.
Needless to say my family will not be going back and will be telling our friends about our experience there.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbFptd3NnRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,2.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaAVQXBYEqSW-JJL4aeA4DZqDcqHXqopZRFkFv=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity
"At Evermore you participate in an interactive, live action story. You get completely immersed in one of (currently) three stories depending on the season. In summer it is Mythos, fall is Lore, and winter is Aurora.

While the stories are different, the mechanisms are the same. You meet characters portrayed by Evermore actors. They will give you tasks or quests to be accomplished. Completing these quests allows you to ""level up"" and possibly join a guild.

Expect to spend an hour or more completing a quest, and 20-30 minutes to finish a task. That's my biggest complaint with Evermore. You should be able to complete tasks faster and get rewards more quickly.

The other problem is sometimes many people will be backed up at a particular actively or character. The best way to avoid this is to work on multiple tasks or quests simultaneously. That way if one area is busy you can work on a different task.

Many people dress up but it certainly is not required. There are quite a few people walking around in street clothes. However, if you want to dress up in themed costumes, you definitely won't be alone. Note that real weapons (swords, knives, etc.) are not allowed but plastic or wood replicas are fine.

Be sure to look for the Evermore pendant to identify characters vs. your fellow ""world walkers"" (park guests) who dressed in costume. At night the pendent is lighted so they are easy to spot.

If you're new to Evermore, the best suggestion is to talk to all the characters you meet (even just walking around) & ask lots of questions. While the actors will remain in character, they will answer questions and help you enjoy your experience.

Pro tips:
1. Buy tickets online for a slight discount & generally faster entry
2. Bring a hat, sunglasses, & sunscreen
3. Bring a water bottle & stay hydrated
4. Bring a notebook & pen or pencil, you'll want to write down notes & facts
5. Avoid backpacks & large pursues, they are subject to search & will slow down your entry
6.

This is obviously a much smaller cave system and park than mammoth caves.  However mammoth caves while impressive due to size doesn't really have quite as much cave feel to it because of that size... That being said these are not claustrophobic caves that make you crawl on your hands and knees it's just most areas are closer to a standard hallway with larger rooms scattered here and there.

The buffet was great and had three entree choices, chicken, prime rib and something else.  A good sale, mashed taters, Brussels sprouts, green beans and rolls were other choices.  The desert bar had chocolate candies, strawberries covered in chocolate, cupcakes, banana pudding and a chocolate cake so yummy.

Eagle Harbor is located right accross the bay and walking distance to Penninsula State Park. When we entered the property it was beautifully places homes giving you a royal feel of a town.

He check us in and off we went to our room Tilla. Tilla was the 1st room up the stairs on your left. Room was rather small but well designed and very cozy. The antique looks gave it a very stylish english look. The washroom was large enough and had a sky light to it. B&B main building was well decorated (pics attached) and well kept. This beautiful B&B was one of the best we have visited so far. Their breakfast was really good with some freshly baked chocolate Croissant, Cherry Yogurt, Juices Cereals and much more.

Instead, I got the mean green burrito and I loved how fresh it was- I love love love greens and veggies in a burrito and the tomatillo on top was superb.

"I loved this re-discovery recently! I vowed that if I ever noticed that Gaia Cafe was back  in any way I would maintain patronage as I used to frequent the Cafe when I was a student at Aquinas with friends and family as I maintained a vegetarian diet the majority of my time in attendance there. Thank you for coming back, I love the changes and the maintenance of staple favorites like B.Y.O.B. and Mean Green Burrito. I personally chose the Veggie Stash as recommended by my wonderful hostess (I selected the vegan options for cream cheese and cheese toppings as in recent years I have had to cut dairy out of my diet more fully). I had a lovely experience with the self service water and coffee, enjoying the flow of the community coming in and out of the Cafe as I spent a few hours there working on a few personal and professional goals and trying a new, but also nostalgic, meal.

"Enjoyed a nice breakfast today at Gaia. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. Our party of six was seated immediate on a Saturday morning.

Unpretentious, casual, warm interior. Small menu, but nice to have so many vegetarian and vegan options. Good to have the opportunity to try something different, outside the normal brunch fare.

I stuck with what I normally like - eggs & potatoes plus tried a fruit cup. It was a filling portion and cooked well. The potatoes were well seasoned and crispy. I also enjoyed the sourdough bread that came with my meal. The fruit was fresh and seasonal. Coffee was self-service and offered three options, with creamer available at request. I tried the Swiss chocolate brew and liked it a lot. My friend’s specialty French toasted looked amazing. It has tender sweet sautéed apples, cherry sauce, and almonds.

"Unfortunately I don’t have anything good to say about Gaia house . When we were sat down there was paint bubbling near us, probably due to moisture trapped behind the paint. And then a leak above. It’s not really an appetizing sight.

We were told that we wouldn’t be able to have espresso or lattes because the espresso machine was down. That’s fine. What I did take issue with was the self serve coffee station. For one, the way the glasses were stored was gross. The shelves were not clean. The cups were freshly washed. I could tell because they were wet, placed rim down. So that the dust and debris on the shelving was collected on the wet rims of the cups. And whenever you picked up a cup you could see the wet rim marked it left. These cups should be dry if you’re going to store them rim down. Drying them rim down traps the moisture inside (causing an unpleasant odor and taste), and damages the shelves, and is altogether unsanitary if the shelves aren’t even clean. Storing them rim side up would be a better option in this case . They are used often enough for collecting dust to be an argument for storing them rim side down. Sanitary conditions aside, for a vegan/vegetarian place for the only milk option to be whole milk was disappointing. Consider offering milk alternatives.

The food was even more disappointing . My guest ate his omelet , but I good not stomach my food. The cornbread French toast was incredibly dry, even soaking it in the butter and syrup didn’t revive it. The potatoes tasted fine but they were stale. Since it was the only semi edible thing available to me I picked at that instead of what I ordered. I only managed to eat half of one slice of French toast and didn’t want to take it home. We came out of our way to go here after seeing it on Instagram.

"Everything from start to finish was fantastic! The onion soup was flavorful and did not need the Gruyère cheese, but the cheese made it better. Perfect for a cold winter night! The steak tartare was also flavored well with peppers and the perfect ratio to the sauce. The chips made it even better. The duck breast matched well with the parsnip purée and was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The flavor profile had a gamier edge. The portion sizes were generous, and there were extra duck pieces mixed in with the vegetables. The cocktails were a delight: my old fashioned had a clear, custom cut ice cube that added to the aesthetic charm. The drink tasted better over time as the ice melted.

"So disappointed with my stay here and very disappointed with how our issues were handled. Came here with friends and booked 2 rooms next to each other. Both our rooms were filthy. Mine had a few dead roaches by the bed/tv, some random dirty boxers, and a giant layer of dirt all through the carpet. When we complained they did not take any action for a whole day. They offered us either a cleaning or two (much worse) rooms that weren't even together. The manager didn't even reach out to me until after we checked out.

The front desk is exemplary. Far exceeds your ideas for the best customer service, and truly takes care of you.

Their marketplace was also top notch. They have a variety of quality goods, from banana bread, bagels, candies, gourmet sandwiches with chips, variety of beverages/sodas, fresh hot coffee, and an entire freezer full of Savannah's best ice cream, Leopold's! (Sandwich kit is a lil pricey at $15, but it was good).

Also, when the Hyatt's computers went down, they were still able to handle and help customers. Really impressed with the level of care and the helpfulness. The valet was also pretty good.

"Overall, we had a good stay. Came here with my sisters, mother, and nieces for a girls night out. The room was clean and comfortable but a bit dated. Staff were friendly and helpful during our stay.

The pool was heated, but it was still cold in my opinion. They ran out of towels when I had arrived to the pool so I had to wait until I was ready to leave and they had just restocked the towels. The playground was small, but nice. The basketball court was also nice. The table tennis could have been maintained better, the net was broken so was the 1 paddle that was at the table. While I was there the restaurant was closed for renovations. So were unable to get room service despite the front desk telling me the other restaurant was opened, but I was unable to get connected to that restaurant.

The concierges to help us with anything we needed. We texted them a few times to get some information and they were very prompt, helpful and really nice. The room is wonderful, very clean  and modern. See pics. Were going to us the heated pool , hot tub and will try the on site restaurant, will update our review post.
Update, we did goto the indoor pool and it was enchanting. Indoor heated pool was great. You get cards for towel service when you check in and get a fresh towel when you arrive to the pool. The jacuzzi was corded off due to maintenance. While that was dissapointing for our evening I greatly appreciated thier concern for guests safety.
We also had dinner at the restaurant and that was incredible. They have this seafood dish with a tomato broth that was divine. Everyone in our party raved about thier food.
Breakfast, we would advise to skip the buffet, it was not up to the rest of the standards. Pastries were days old, the hot fares were mediocre.  The fruit was nice but that was not worth the price. So I would suggest breakfast offsite and there close places to choose from.

Absolutely loved our experience! Our daughter had requested a night at a hotel with a swimming pool for her birthday. We had made mention of this to staff when booking and asked for a ballon in the room as something special. Staff went above and beyond by including some snacks for her as well as a card in addition to the ballon. Needless to say our 4 yr old freaked out when she saw it. Thank you so much to the staff that made our night special for our girl! We got a poolside room and so we were able to make the most of our time swimming. Our room was spacious and clean.

"This place doesn’t look like much when you pull up, but once inside you can tell that they take pride in this hotel.
Everything in the lobby was very clean, neat and orderly. It looked like this place had been remodeled recently.
The breakfast and sitting area are located right off of the main entrance across from the lobby.
It too was very clean and neat.
I stopped here for one night on my return trip home from Florida.
I always choose a Best Western because the rooms are very clean, they give you complimentary toiletries, blow dryer, iron and ironing board, a coffee pot and free coffee in your room. You also get a refrigerator and microwave in your room and free WiFi.
I always try to get a king size bedroom. The beds are super comfortable, and I’m able to get a good nights sleep.
With my room came with a complimentary breakfast. This is standard with most Best Westerns.
This Smithville Best Western has an indoor pool which is permanently closed and a gym. I did not use them.
For breakfast they serve scrambled eggs, ham or bacon, grits, homemade waffles, that you make yourself. Cold cereal, oatmeal, fresh fruit, yogurt, biscuits and sausage gravy, bagels, toast, muffins, pastries, coffee, tea, juices, or milk. You can have as much as you want. The breakfast is constantly replenished by a sweet older lady.
Checkin was very easy. The front desk staff was extremely nice, and made some recommendations when we asked. They have a free parking lot.
This hotel is located off I-95, this low-key hotel is an 8-minute walk from shopping at Carolina Premium Outlets and 2 miles from the Ava Gardner Museum. The prices were reasonable for this hotel.

We knew construction was still ongoing, so finding the entrance from the garage was a bit confusing but the best level to park on was P1 on the far side away from the Casino itself because this took you to the backside of the Casino which is where they have the new entrance for the Hotel. The moment you walk in to the hallway, you see the Gelato place and the gift shop all next to David's (the hotel restaurant). You honestly forget you were in the Live! Casino itself just a few seconds ago. The check-in staff was very attentive and helpful in finding our reservations and getting us on our way; the only bad part was I expected a $20 free play but because I had already gotten this credit a few years ago, they didn't give it to me.

We had our unit on the 8th floor for a King Suite with a bathtub and shower. It was a very spacious master suite, with a huge bathroom. The toilet and shower each had a separate glass door unit with a double vanity. The room had huge fantastic glass windows with a view to the Costco, still cool overall. The downside was the sound-proof of the room; we heard the planes outside since we were on the BWI runway side and also housekeeping having large conversations in the hallway sounded like they were inside our own room. I also was disappointed that they did not give hand soap (at least the little bars) for you to use. Also, the pillows were not what I expected in a luxury suite, not that comfortable.

The Keurig coffee machine was a nice plus to have in the room, along with an iron and ironing board. The attention to detail in having robes was also nice; the large screen TV was great (w/ plenty of channels and ability to link with your streaming apps). The nice touch of having a touch pad with your name was cool; it also has a built-in app for white noise which was helpful. Finally, having a couch (not that comfy), coffee table and office desk were nice pluses.

In regard to the Spa and Fitness center, we went down to see the Fitness center and overall were impressed with the equipment (mainly aerobics, but nice smith machines, kettle and dumbbells). We didn't see inside the Spa area but it looked very spacious. Otherwise, we went down to the Casino itself and played.

For the price we paid for a King suite, we expected a bit more (ie. some extras included). But definitely worth a shot!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJazlMaWh3RRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Live!+Casino+%26+Hotel+Maryland/@35.8076728,-90.2479862,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89b7e3e744d116a9:0xa87434c1ecc1bc43!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.1577546!4d-76.7268883!16s%2Fm%2F0gmdn3v?hl=en",ChIJqRbRROfjt4kRQ7zB7ME0dKg,Casino,4.0,Live!

"After passing this restaurant numerous times my hubby and I   decided it was finally time to give it a try.  Well...we were not disappointed! We began our meal with the fried mozzarella which was highly recommended by both the hostess and our server.  Excellent and not your typical...these were huge and there were five of them..more like logs as they're referred to by staff! And marinara dipping sauce was really good...just a slight kick to it.  Hubby then had  a crabcake and shrimp and chicken fajitas (he couldn't decide between the two as entrées so getting the crabcake as an add on worked out great!)...and I had the yummy strawberry apple walnut salad with chicken. The entire meal...and a few adult beverages...were perfect! And our server, Sammie (sp?) was so helpful, friendly and sweet... made our dining experience even more enjoyable.

The boats they rent are perfect for all your basic needs on Lake George - tubing, water skiing, fishing, picnicking on an island in the Narrows,  or just moored up at Sandy Bay.

"After a few years of renting boats from a local competitor that always had issues (non existent bimini, broken gas gauge, engine that was leaking gas, dirty and old boats, etc), i decided to try a new rental place.

I rented the 18 foot 150hp Bowrider.  There were no massive issues like before.  The boat was clean, fast, and fun.  The stereo didn't work but we had a wireless water proof speaker for this anyways.  We rented for 3 days and came back once for a fuel up in between.

The only downside was that we hit an underwater log in the middle of the lake.  They showed me the damage to the skeg and as I had taken a pic of the prop/skeg before the rental, it was undeniable.  Got hit with a $350 charge for repair, but I can't blame Yankee as this is part of the risk of boating.

"I stayed here for the NENA conference last year, and I'd heard only negative things about the hotel.  I'm happy to say they were wrong!

The hotel underwent a renovation at some point in the last few years so the rooms are more modern.  From what my co-worker said it ""used to look like a dump"".  There are some issues with quality of the rooms where it looks like a flipper did them.  An example is the shower doors where they will slide open on their own.  My room as well as my co-worker had this issue.

The pool is very large with a nice bar and a window to order food and drinks from while outside.  There is also a clear walking path to the beach.  There is an inside and outside pool area.  The inside area has a hot tub and a little area for swimming inside (it's connected to the main pool, so if it storms - you'll need to get out).  The inside area is slippery, so watch your footing and DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS RUN.  The main large pool has a walk over bridge and a gazebo where live music was played every day I was there.

If you want food, they have two restaurants that serve dinner (one casual and one fancy), but they are a little pricey.  The fancier option you'll need to make a reservation for as they are small and don't have space for walk ins.  There is also a little cafe that is open in the mornings with coffee and muffins.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aGFlZlhREAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Perdido+Beach+Resort/@31.9788356,-97.5429081,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x889a070af414aab9:0x44d9126e8d835330!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d30.273649!4d-87.561467!16s%2Fg%2F1tj2p783?hl=en",ChIJuaoU9AoHmogRMFODjW4S2UQ,Hotel,5.0,Perdido Beach Resort,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxh6GNdN_9RrghyVOEex5lKO2MeYagacVC_Elj=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

They also have pizza and salad options and so much more.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHOTYyODN3RRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Fazoli's/@42.5625955,-96.9852911,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x878dfff4ad86f2c3:0xe8ee06247c2fc9de!8m2!3d42.4367247!4d-96.3650302!16s%2Fg%2F11lgytsy77?hl=en",ChIJw_KGrfT_jYcR3skvfCQG7ug,Italian restaurant,5.0,Fazoli's,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvKBAgIQnVahXedijPcB5cLzYJsd2aSsbja5Eg=w150-h150-k-no-p,restaurant

"Very economical. This sampler I got had 4 different things on it using a big plate. For $3 more, you get a salad and drink. All said and done, about $12 for everything, and it was a ton of food. Service was great. Food was prepared quickly, very friendly people, and attentive to check up on you. Bread sticks (when dining in) are unlimited, and they come hot and fresh, buttered and seasoned with garlic. They are super soft and fluffy. Honestly, I rate their breadsticks above Olive Gardens. They are wonderful. Reasons why I’m not going with 5 stars, is nothing that this location has control over. It’s not a complaint of the individual location itself. First issue is, I felt the Alfredo sauce was very bland. I’ve had stuff out of a jar at home that beats it. Secondly, the amount of sauce (all 3 pastas had the same issue) they put on is very little compared to the noodles you get. My feeling is, I can buy a pound of uncooked noodles for $1 at the store. After they absorb the water, you’ve got 2lbs of noodles for $1. Commercially, they buy them much cheaper than that even. Noodles are incredibly cheap. Yet, you’re not really given enough sauce for them. Since pasta is so cheap, you’d think they could afford another 50 cents of sauce. The picture makes it look ok because it’s all on the top. It certainly looks like a decent amount of sauce. But you can’t see the noodle to sauce ratio. Also, I assume they have a pre-specified ladle size they are told to use. However, mix things up (or eat the top portion), and you’ll quickly find yourself eating plain noodles. Again, I’m sure this is a corporate thing, and not location specific, but you’re reading my review because you want an honest review, right? So, I’m going to tell my experience as it was. Over all, I’m giving it 4 stars still, as service is good, breadsticks are wonderful, and food was pretty good, aside from the lack of sauce. Go in there prepared with this info, and see what you think. And remember, those wonderful breadsticks... they are unlimited. They will keep bringing more if you want. And, you’ll likely want them to.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLa1A2Y1l3EAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Fazoli's/@42.5625955,-96.9852911,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x878dfff4ad86f2c3:0xe8ee06247c2fc9de!8m2!3d42.4367247!4d-96.3650302!16s%2Fg%2F11lgytsy77?hl=en",ChIJw_KGrfT_jYcR3skvfCQG7ug,Italian restaurant,4.0,Fazoli's,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvInS7CqLbU6owlayALHl3bV3IVsl8nVeWVyC-=w150-h150-k-no-p,restaurant

"I've eaten there, and now I work there. So I get to see the food ""behind the scenes"". Most, if not all, is homemade in the sense that whoever the cook is, they will cook it their own way with their own ingredients like they would in their own home. So you get to try the same food about 4 to 5 different ways which I think is pretty awesome. The cooks take allergy warnings very seriously. The owners come in pretty much every day to make sure we dont stray off of the path that they made to build this restaurant and its food upon. We have SO many return customers that when they're off work they will hang out with us from open to close. We strive to be extra friendly and helpful! And our MANY return customers can verify.  We have 2 flat screens to watch your sports on or for your child to watch cartoons so you can eat with some peace (lol). Our food is great tasting. Certain waitresses will buy 4 to 5 bowls of homemade cream of crab soup to take home for the night. As an example. So if we trust the food enough to eat it AND buy it in bulk, I'm sure you will love your dinner! Since I started working 1 month ago, I have yet to hear not even one complaint. If I work somewhere that's not all that good, I'm not afraid to say so. So I promise I'm not on here because anyone told me to, or to try to gain more customers etc. I simply rated it because my phone noticed how often I come here and asked me to review it LOL. Dont be afraid to give it a try. The portions range from ""good size for the money"" to ""Massive""! We are located inside the Laurel De Truck Stop/gas station with the Hardees hooked to it.

"Pretty decent little sandwich shop. They have hoagies, cheesesteaks, burgers, wings, and almost any other American type food. Tonight, I saw they had a great deal on Uber Eats offering buy 1 get one 1 free on select items. I decided to try the classic Philly cheesesteak, which also came with their hand cut fries (you also have the option of substituting chicken for steak).

The cheesesteak was about $12.50 each, which I think is an okay price. Portion size is decent too, not too big nor too small. I will say that there was quite a lot of bread in comparison to the meat, cheese, and vegetables. I believe the bun was too thick. The steak itself was pretty flavorful and had a good texture. They use an adequate amount of cheese. Good amount of mushrooms, and each mushroom is quite big, but they do have a slight canned flavor.

The fries were just okay. Quality probably declined due to them being in the car for delivery. Still, they were not bad, and definitely nice to get fries for free. As usual, I would have wanted a bit more salt or pepper, and they were a bit limp.

All in all, not a bad spot for a sandwich, wings, or other classic American fare. The cheesesteak was still enjoyable, just nothing special.
