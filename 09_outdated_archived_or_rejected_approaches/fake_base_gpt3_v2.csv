,,,"**DO NOT BUY ANY RHYTHM GAME PASSES UNTIL THESE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED**

Very niche complaint here, I know, but this is so frustrating. Aside from some of the games being broken (some for several months now), new games like Music Diver end up lagging.

But one thing that could easily be fixed is removing the acrylic plates keeping people from scanning their cards or putting in their PIN numbers on the touch screen. Part of the appeal of these games is the ability to save progress (that's what keeps me coming back), but these silly shields protecting the cabinets are in the way. Charging people $6 per card and then preventing them from using them is nothing short of a scam.",Round 1,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVeDZhNV9BRRAB,Amusement center,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FAKE,ChIJ-9sjCNIKIocRl6FxNDni4UQ,,A Google Maps review about a Amusement center. ###," Had so much fun here.

,,,"1/2022:  RECOMMEND, but 3.5 stars if possible due to 2 details:

If possible, go during the WEEKDAY for Unlimited bowl until 5pm for $11.99. I've hurt my arms & shoulders from bowling way too many games during this inexpensive time and improved my bowling scores.  (Thank you Round 1).

I've enjoyed going to Round 1 to relax and enjoy the oversized Pac-man game and bowl some stress away.  I have not tried the food nor drinks there because I just go in to play games.

Mostly clean, spacious and social distancing  protocols are  in effect.  Team members were constantly cleaning.  My only negative comment is that no one has cleaned the escalator entrance and it looks unwelcoming/unsightly.

The price was also very good, especially compared to those resorts and cabins inside RMNP (Riding Mountain National Park). These are attractive enough so I decided to give it a try.

I have to tell you that I was not disappointed at all even though I  set my expectation very high. This B&B is right out of the town of Onanole, on a small hill right beside Hwy 10. Only 7km from the entrance of RMNP, you have easy and quick access to the park while still enjoy the quiet and beautiful setting of the B&B. The historic building has been beautifully restored and tastefully decorated. The room feels cozy and the bed is comfortable and supportive. The full breakfast (with bacon, egg/omelette, toasts, fruits, and coffee) was delicious.

While we were there the owners, Cindy and Earl began another project on the grounds, preparing an area for wedding ceremonies to be held.

,,,"A whole lot to say about our visit.

It was opening day so things were bound to go a bit sideways.

Pros:

Kammi our ref - absolutely amazing! She was attentive to the group, very friendly but had no problem calling out safety items the instant someone's mask wasn't all the way down or an uncovered barrell. She was great and I highly recommend you request her if you are taking a group.

The different games fields were fun and challenging. Our group had seasoned vets and first time adults and teens so it was well balanced. Kammi started us out easy and then introduced respawns and play until you're out of paint which everyone loved.

The field paint quality was really good in my opinion. Very consistent and I wish I had a marker that could really sling it.

The whole staff was friendly and went above and beyond to ensure everyone was safe and having fun.

Cons:

The hiccups of opening day with any business, but the owner and his team took it in stride and powered through.

Ran out of air so they were transporting tanks back and forth. Also ran out of cases of paint but that too was resolved with a trip the their warehouse.  These two items didn't affect our play or the amount of fun we had.

The rental markers were all over the place. Different models, broken detents, etc.  Once again - opening day, but it's on the calendar - clean and check everything weeks in advance. We replaced a few tank o-rings ourselves from our parts kits to save time.

No chronographing of walk on players. The rentals were slow and hot and some walk on teens were definitely pushing 300 fps. That's a safety thing especially with rental masks/lenses and horrible experience for young teens playing for the first time.

I am very glad our group made it down and even with said hiccups we had a blast and will be back in the future.",The Edge Paintball Experience,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMjd5VVZnEAE,Paintball center,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FAKE,ChIJHdE1hIMeBogR8LNOcMnA1wE,,A Google Maps review about a Paintball center. ###," Balls of fun.

,,,"Here’s the good and the bad and the very bad.

The good: The front desk staff who checked us in was very nice, the front office is very nice, and the shower was very nice. Get the picture?

The bad: this is an old motel that needs updating. The carpets are ripped, the sofa is ripped and covered up with a coverlet rather than replacing it, there is a mirror in front of the sofa rather than a TV to look at, and the bed is old and sagging in the middle. And this is an executive suite!Figure that out. Just look at the pictures.

The very bad: we booked a King executive suite. We were told that someone had already taken that suite and extended their stay. Instead of telling them that we had a reservation and that the motel could move them to another room, we were told that we would be moved to another room. We were given a queen executive suite. No discount. No offer of points. Just a “sorry, we can’t guarantee a room.”  When we complained, the manager was quite generous (please note that is sarcasm) by giving  us a whole 500 points. Wow-wee!

The very very bad: And they have the nerve to charge over $200 for the room.

PS The microwave was unplugged and that was because it didn’t work, which I reported to the morning clerk. They don’t serve breakfast in the motel. You have to go next door to the restaurant and the tip is not included. But honestly, we wished we had skipped breakfast because the cook must’ve had a bad morning and most of the food was not cooked enough - runny eggs although ordered fried hard, hash browns hard on one side/soft on the other, the same with the English muffin.

I am paranoid about travelling due to the current pandemic, but I didn’t have a worry in the world with how spotless and clean this room was. Felt comfortable, and like home. No dirt, dust bunnies ANYWHERE.

Check in was fast an efficient. This motel could be charging way more than they are for the quality of rooms they provide.

The rooms had pots, pans, dishes, utensils, and whatever else you could need to make yourself a quick meal if you didn’t feel like going out to a nearby restaurant.

The bed was comfy, which is a rare find in most motels. They also has 3 different mattress protectors on the mattress itself, all extremely clean. They provide an additional blanket on top of the shelf as well.

I was also extremely grateful for the working air conditioner, another rare find in motels.

FOOD - ordered the Tuna tartare, which was good, but extremely oily. The appetizer came out really fast. For main course we got the Mykonos salad and the Salmon salad, both were average. Brussels sprouts in the Salmon salad tasted burned and unseasoned.

The issue I had were with front desk.  Did not have my room reservation when I checked in.  At one point I had over $1200 in temporary authorizations.  Went to front desk multiple times and was assured those temp charges would be removed at checkout.

Day of check out I ask for itemized list of charges which was at zero.  Couple hours later I receive a revised bill with me owing $259.  Call the resort and literally no one picks up the phone on multiple attempts to try and resolve this issue.

Have to send it to our company event coordinator to see if this will get fixed.

,,,"We are here last night, December 17th 2021, for my my husband's 28th birthday.

We have lived in Baldwin for 2 years and those years have been pretty rough, we were so lucky to find an apartment in sweet and quiet Baldwin City. We love it here and plan on buying a home. We've experienced quite a few events here but this was our first local restaurant. We were finally able to come to The Wooden Spoke after hearing so much about it and we brought friends from out of town.

What a charming, down-home, relaxed place. The parking lot felt like you were pulling into a old-time drive in, but you get out of your car and reach the door and it feels like you are standing outside of someone's well-loved home. The tables reminded me of my own kitchen tables in my childhood home. I felt comfortable as soon as I sat down. The waitress was extremely attentive, her energy was calm and sincere. Our drink orders were taken immediately, our appetizers came out quickly and the entrees were the best home cooking we all have had in many years.

We ordered the KC strip, the ribeye, the bourban steak and the spoke burger, spoke fries, mash potatoes, the chilli, mozzarella sticks, potato skins, and the wings in this beautiful honey brown sauce that was sweet, spicy, smoky and honestly it was incredible. I love WINGS and these took the trophy from me and my friends!

Our food and plates were hot, the food was fast. All the steaks were cooked as asked, all steaks were medium rare, juicy, delicious and quite big. Burger was done just well and had a classic burger taste.

The alcoholic beverages were delicious and made strong.

My daughter ordered the kids chicken strips and she said they were very good, we loved the fries. The spoke burger was amazing and the mustard tasted homemade. My husband especially loved the chilli. Overall, the food was spectacular. The service was fast and friendly, the environment was clean and comfy. We will definitely be back.

Thank you wooden spoke staff and mad respect and kudos to the Chef who made an unforgettable night full of nostalgic decor, warm and friendly interaction and phenomenal home-cooking! See you again soon!!

I would have rather drove three more hours then not have a nice place to sleep and shower at. I am very upset and I have NEVER in my life wrote a review. I am not hard to please! The Wi-Fi code does not work. The phone does not work. The phone plug keeps falling out every time I pick up the phone. The top layer of the sheet had dirt on it or food. Looks like cake. I stay at many hotel. This is unacceptable. Also On top of this. I was told you guys price match. There was a deal online that was $20 cheaper than the right here and they said they could not do it. So even more annoyed right now that I came here because I thought I was getting a deal. After having heart issues with my bank it took a little longer than necessary which is totally my fault. My car got blocked because were out of town. I would have paid the extra money to stay in a clean hotel but after carrying all of her bags and everything up for four people, me and my husband have to work tomorrow. And both of our kids are ready for bed. None of us will be showering in the bathroom and we are all disgusted to the point we don’t want to get off our beds u less we have our shoes on.
Livid to say the least. The cleaning lady left a envelope for a tip???? She has to be joking. She needs to be fired. Oh!!! and the what class that my daughter went to use had a big black hair in it. Look close at pics! Gross!!!!

Staff is very friendly. I will say. They were nice. Although a guy followed us up to make sure the second room was clean. It wasn’t.. and he walked away and did nothing.

,,,"We stopped at a quick one night stop to get some sleep, shower, and back get on the road. It was on the way to where we were headed, so it worked perfectly. Things that need improvement: 1. The thermostat. It was not accurate and as you can see my thermostat said it was 65% humidity, because theirs wasn’t working and wouldn’t trigger air on its own. My husband continued to smell mildew every time he walked into the room, I must have missed it the 2 times I walked in. 2. The vent, it could use some cleaning. I am not sure how clean the air we manually forced out of it was.
Good things on why I scored it high: 1. Price was great. 2. Location for us was awesome. 3. It did the job provide a nice firm mattress for us to get some good shut eye. The pillows could have been comfier, but for the price I will not complain! 4. The one person we interacted with at the desk was great. 5. Had a pool, we didn’t use it but I heard kids were enjoying it when I was checking in. 6. Overall thought things were relatively clean! 7. The bathroom was super cute and had a cool mirror/light. 8.

Waited 2 hrs for them to clean my room. Unsafe as no secure locking for entrance to the building. They don't change the bed sheets every stay. Horrible experience ever! ,A Google Maps review about a Hotel. ###
,,,"Not a great experience overall. The only redeeming factors about the hotel are the price and the friendly employees. I stayed here while doing business in the area. I figured that swimming in one of 2 pools would be a great way to relax afterwards, especially for the price. Well, it could have definitely been better.

The first thing I noticed about the hotel is the smell of marijuana in the elevator. Then, when I got up to the hotel room, I tried to get in with the key cards they gave me. It took me no less than 10 tries to successfully use this card. I swiped it almost the same way 10 times, and it magically opened on the 10th.

The room itself was somewhat chilly when I got in. I changed the temperature and it started to heat up quickly. But, there was another odd burnt smell coming from the conditioner. It was dirty, too. Breakfast was decent. Food was nothing special, but the guy serving breakfast was awesome. Very friendly, even though I just had some coffee he offered me some freshly cooked food.

The pools were nice. Not too many people at night or during the day. Expect it to be more crowded at 9 pm than at 11 am, though. There were loads of what seemed to be pool algae all around the pool (dark green in color) but the water itself was clean. Good ambiance with the rocks and faux plants. Not too cold or too warm. Decent fitness center, too. Treadmill worked fine, they had dumbbells and a few other strength training machines. Pretty basic and small.

It's a bit tough to sleep during the night. They didn't give any pillows or blankets for the 2nd room with the pull out bed. You can hear everything and I was a bit concerned about a door near my room. People walking in and out all the time and you will surely hear some of that.

All in all, if you want a cheap hotel with 2 pools, this may be the place. The location is pretty convenient and the employees were very friendly.

They have a spa, golfing course within walking distance, a tram that runs every 20-30 minutes to nearby restaurants and outlet, and is situated in a gated community with security. However, I am extremely disappointed in the manner in which I was charged a $75 late fee checkout from Dawn Lucas. I am an Hilton Honors member and my room was without any heat the entire night. No one checked on the room, despite several inquires. I was freezing and slept for only a few hours. I asked for a late checkout to rest and have never had a problem with late checkouts before, even when hotels are at full occupancy. It wasn't so much the charge that bothered me but rather the manner and attitude I received regarding it. It was unprofessional and came across as extremely rude. Dawn almost seemed to take delight in charging the late fee, something that I felt extremely off putting. For those who see these, I caution you to be aware of their late checkout policies, especially if you are a Hilton Honors member, because I am now less hesitant to book my stay there again.

The Food court has gotten back into it's groove and the options are plentiful and given a 4 Day 3 night stay we had tried just about everything with no complaints. The main Restaurant was superb, my Steak couldn't have been cooked any better and exactly as I requested. Medium with no seasoning only salt and hint of cracked pepper. This place still has plenty of real table games(it's nice have a real human for a dealer). They still have a mix of virtual table machines but the balance was much better than a lot of other out of the way casino resorts are going. Great selection of slots but still like all the other casinos, they are very tight. The areas for those not able to gamble was open and they had plenty to do to keep them busy. I recommend you check out their website to see all the options and entrainment available to anyone traveling with young people. I seen quite a few on this trip and they seemed quite happy and talkative. In all, we enjoyed this visit but I still miss my Wisconsin favorites. However, this one will definitely grow on you. Enjoy and definitely Good Luck! You'll need it, Lol.

I still have to get used to the higher drink prices (""We're not in Wisconsin anymore""😂). The area is Beautiful and lots to do if you need a break and you're not in the gambling mood.

I came for the Bob's Big Burger station. I don’t know if it was a limited time thing or not, but it is a Big Mac style burger with double patties and Big Mac sauce.

Second this is a extremely loud hotel. Every door opens and closes every room as we were next to a side entrance. We were given a white noise machine which helped mask some of the sounds during the night. However the hallways are incredibly loud especially multiple people passing by. There’s construction work happening during daylight hours so it’s not just at night that it’s noisy and it’s quite disruptive. From what I understand the west wing is updated and the east wing (which we were in) is more outdated and less noise insulated.

,,,"This post should have been made in March 2021 but the trauma of the night is still a struggle for me.

I had been here once before and had a decent time. We paid extra for VIP and side lot parking. This night that lot was full and we parked on a side lot that was “monitored / guarded.” We got there and did not do a VIP experience as we had time to kill. It felt like the line did not move and easily an hour after standing in line we made it to the front of the building. We were 4 or 5 groups back and the line completely stopped. Across from us was the VIP line for the front door and they were not permitted to enter either. Several people from both lines would knock and ask questions but were disrespected.

Visitors had purchased tickets online and did not wish to continue to wait. They knocked to see if they could get a date adjustment and still the doors would be slammed in their face. There wasn’t a special uniform for the workers so when people knocked some would be allowed entry but no one updated the crowd outside. Eventually after a 2 hour wait (from arrival) the security guard shared they were short staffed and had to allow some people to clear out. There was no apology or anything just blatant disrespect to paying customers.

When we arrived and paid to park in the trap museum lot it was early evening and the lot was lit up by sunlight. By the time we finished the museum we came out to night time. The lot we paid to park in was not well lit when we returned to my vehicle. I found my vehicle damaged, articles stolen and when I asked the attendant he radioed a manager as he was too busy and didn’t know anything happened.

We spoke with the representative or manager who went by the name A1. He did not provide his full name but assured us they would fix my window. This time of evening we could not get anyone out and due to Covid mobile window repairs were limited. Still A1 shared the museum would cover the costs. The police came and took a report along with dusting for fingerprints. The thieves not only broke my window they damaged my glove compartment that had my Glock locked inside of it. They stole work items to include files, electronics and my work laptop. The serial numbers of all of my items were added to the police report.

I am a business owner and could not work for a month as I had to work to replace the electronics, files and missed opportunities to make money as I did not have the tools. I shared this with A1 and a lady named Adlia along with sharing the price point for replacing my window. I submitted all of my receipts for my window, loss work and equipment in hopes they would replace my work electronics as a thank you to a military veteran. It was wishful thinking but they mentioned they were short staffed, they pretended to understand how this interrupted my night and work as well.

They offered to cashapp me $300 for my window and a we are sorry that happened. Window itself was $300 and that did not include emergency installation. This place gave me a real life experience of what it means to support the trap.

They will give as many hints as you would like. Only the first requested 3 hints are free though. Anything beyond those 3 result in a 3-minute penalty each. You still get a full hour to break out, no matter how many hints you use. You're time will just look longer than one hour. This is how people get scores of 64 minutes, even though you only have an hour max.

The do give free hints if they see that you're stuck. These do not count against your 3 free requested hints, nor do they penalize your time.

My advice for the uninitiated is to not be afraid to use the hints! Especially if you're not going to try again at a later date. Enjoy the puzzles, but don't let them frustrate you. Make sure someone is keeping track of time so that you can pace the free hints.

This space is geared more towards younger children than adults per say, but even adults will enjoy their time. Lots of things to do (touch pools, photo opportunities) and items to buy at the gift shop.",SEA LIFE Kansas City,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHM19EWm5nRRAB,Tourist attraction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FAKE,ChIJc8Jk9vTwwIcRGmKbqtAP77E,,A Google Maps review about a Tourist attraction. ###," Hawaii aquarium is pretty small and definitely not worth the price. A lot of the tanks had filters either right in front of the glass or just close by where you can't see the inside of the tank. Also they have lots of dead tanks which I get might be due to the fact that they have to import a lot of the sea life / supplies but I hope they can fill them with more sea life soon. They also have a couple of tanks that are pretty tiny compared to the bigger ones.

You do get to see sea turtles, sharks, stingrays and tons of other sea life however - overall I'd say it's a 3/5! ",A Google Maps review about a Tourist attraction. ###

,,,"I went to this place for the first time ever for my birthday and I made the comment that an insatiable, escape-room monster has been made of me. A little over a month later I’ve already gone through most of the rooms available, with plans to then move to the other location and start tackling the rooms available there as well. The amount of work that must have gone in to these rooms baffles me. There are some puzzles that, when solved, result in things to happen in the room that I’m not sure whether is through the work of intricate wiring or the diligence of the room attendant person. Speaking of room attendant person, I’ve had my party overseen by Alex most of the times I’ve been there and he is a treasure. Super helpful and personable, and so quick to observe when we’ve done something slightly wrong to nudge us a tad and tell us to hey maybe try that thing again. Of course his nudges are always warranted and never ruin any puzzle or sense of achievement we feel when we hear the lock click. He’s also very quick to deliver clues when we do ask for them, and the clues are always exactly what we need.

,,,"Only Ordered the Salad, but a Good Salad

My date and I went to J. Alexander's for a quick workday lunch. It took a while to be seated (no complaints, because it was the lunch rush) and the table service made up for it because our server was prompt and efficient. We both wanted something light and landed on the same thing: the Thai Kai Salad ($16) with chicken, mixed greens, and peanuts tossed in a cilantro vinaigrette with Thai peanut sauce, along with a croissant on the side. It was a great salad and we both enjoyed it because the dressing was flavorful and tangy, had nice pieces of cold-yet-grilled chicken, and we left feeling full. I'm not sure if it was worth $16, but I can't say for certain it was not. One great thing about this salad was we were both productive at work and didn't feel sluggish.",J.

,,,"1 star for a subpar/gross experience at Chicago Getaway Hostel. I rented a private room for 3 nights looking for a clean/decent place to sleep and shower while I was in the city for a work project. Chicago Getaway Hostel did not fit the bill.

The Hostel is in a beautiful Lincoln Park neighborhood with tons of giant trees and you really can't find a better location to get the LP vibe but then walk a block to hop on trains/buses. The cost for a private room is comparable to a hotel room, but I chose this place because it's location was within walking distance to where I was going to be working. After looking at reviews and photos of the hostel, it seemed like a very modern and clean place that I would be comfortable staying at... unfortunately the photos were deceiving and the reviews did not represent my experience.

When I walked up to the building, I had to walk through a crowd of people gathering on the sidewalk outside the hostel smoking (great for my asthma) to enter the building. This happened every time I entered/exited the building over the next few days, which was a real turn off to me. The check in process was quick - the person checking me in rushed through all of the instructions and gave me no written document that verified what he went over, so that was fun.

My room looked nice at first glance - 2 bunk beds, a desk, shower/toilet/sink. All the essentials. Upon further investigation here's what I found (some photos attached)... the bathroom was absolutely disgusting. I don't know when it was last cleaned, but it had to have been a long time. The amount of dirt/grime built up in that shower made me feel dirtier than I was when I walked in. One shouldn't have to buy flip flops to shower in a private room bathroom they rented. There was buildup ON THE SHOWER HEAD where the clean water is supposed to come out of but there was nastiness caked on so it passed through that first.

The beds were pretty uncomfortable. The mattress was very thin and I could feel the bars through it, so it was rough sleeping. A majority of the linens had a ton of stains/loose hairs on them (especially the pillows) and they were very rough in texture. All of this combined made me feel very gross and like the room hadn't been cleaned at all. For the price of a hotel room I'd expect a much higher level of cleanliness from this place.

Needless to say, I will not be back.",Chicago Getaway Hostel,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBX0pyaTNnRRAB,Hostel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FAKE,ChIJq7mvQQ7TD4gRXzDphMBIcA4,,A Google Maps review about a Hostel. ###," Nice Pub Hostel.

,,,"I'm visiting here from Delaware, and I wasn't sure what to expect since the existing reviews are nowhere near consistent. I booked the hotel room through Agoda based solely on the fact that it was a very short (and safe) walk to Oven's Auditorium where my granddaughter's graduation from Hawthorne Academy was scheduled to take place. Overall, I am happy with the room. While it's far from the best place I've ever stayed, and the main elevator has been out of order the entire time I've been here, it has still been an enjoyable stay. The two photos that accompany my review are my photos taken with my Moto phone, not stock photos. My room was very clean upon my arrival. While the furniture was a little dated with a scuff here and there, everything was functional. A little Old English Scratch Cover would definitely make a huge difference in the existing furniture. That said, would I stay here again? Absolutely. The staff was very friendly. They offered me the use of their service elevator to go back and forth to my third floor room, which I thought was really nice since I'm almost 67 years old, and I don't particularly like flights of stairs. The only real disappointment was the fact that the hotel restaurant was permanently closed. Perhaps it was a victim of Covid. I'm not sure. There is a circa 1955 burger establishment almost directly across the highway, but you cannot walk there unless you want to take your life in your hands crossing the very busy highway. I wouldn't try it even if I were Usain Bolt in his prime. But I did drive there, and it only took me about 5 minutes using Google Go directions. (Their Ribeye sandwich was the best I've ever eaten.)  So yeah, I would definitely stay here again. It is ranked as a 3-star hotel, and I give it 4 stars myself because I felt very safe here, and they went out of their way to accommodate me. I will say that if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. Like any other hotel or motel on a busy highway, there is traffic noise at night. The sound of the running AC unit helps, but the foam earplugs really shut it out. ⭐⭐⭐⭐",Golden Green Hotel Daily & Extended Stay - Loving Hut Vegan Restaurant,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPazlMYUFREAE,Hotel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FAKE,ChIJt5rvZxcgVIgRDlxWnDWKtHs,,A Google Maps review about a Hotel. ###," It's a nice location, the rooms are clean.

Anytime you enter an Ethiopian household, you are to expect a warm greeting and coffee as a sign of respect. The waiter was knowledgeable enough to answer questions and make suggestions. He was truly passionate about the food and restaurant. The owner was also great. He came out to talk with guests and ask if everything was to their liking.

This is my absolute favorite place to come for authentic African/Ethiopian cuisine. Not to mention the prices are extremely fair for the delicious food and great experience. If you are looking for a new place to experience different cultures through food, this place is highly recommended. I look forward to my visits here.
