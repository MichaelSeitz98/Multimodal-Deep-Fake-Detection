I actually prefer the machines set up this way - a little more distanced, (not that it's a TON) like they are, it makes it quite nice.

The service was great, they even brought a happy birthday slice of cheese cake to the guest of honor, we did not order or ask for this, it was a kind gesture from the establishment. Afterwards we went into the casino gaming area and we're happy to see it wasn't crowded on a Monday.

"Our hotel room was rather disgusting.  The carpet is full of stains and the wallpaper is pealing off of the wall in the bathroom.  As you will see in one of my pictures they have a holder in the bathtub for decent size bottles of shampoo, conditioner and soap.  The holder locks which I assume is so that nobody can steal their products.  However, the soap wasn't in the locked container.  I guess that is so that their guests can carry that soap back and forth between the shower and the sink because that was the only soap in the room.  Also, the large bottle for conditioner was completely empty.  It seemed more like a $59.99 room instead of a $159 room.  Very disappointing.

"I was very disappointed.  My stay lasted no more than 20 minutes.

When I arrived, the Clerk was disinterested.  I was told to park in the ""school"" parking lot.  What I was NOT told was that someone needed to be there to unlock the gate.  When I pulled up, the lot was locked.  I had to drive around the block to get back into the hotel, to inform the Clerk it was locked, for one of the bellboys to say someone needed to meet me out there to unlock the fence.  I then drove around the block again and was able to get into the parking lot.

Upon entering my hotel room, I was in disbelief.  I understand this is a historic building, but was surprised to find that to them, historic meant outdated, dingy, dirty, and simply un-maintained.

I rented a 2 bedroom suite.  The kitchen was in a room off of 1 bedroom, while the bathroom was in the other bedroom.  So, to use the restroom, you had to enter the other guest's room.  If you wanted to watch TV, you had to go into the bedroom with the kitchen.  The kitchen was outdated.  The kitchen sink did not have handles and was filthy.  The fridge didn't shut unless you slammed it.  I understand now why their website has minimal photos of their rooms.

There is no AC or central air.  The wall heaters were on when I arrived.  I turned them all off.  To cool my room, I opened the windows.  I was on the 4th floor and had no screen on my large windows.   A loose nail was just sitting on my window ledge.  I called down to the front desk and had them bring up 2 fans, which I put in my windows to attempt some form of cool air in my suite.

There were dead flies and bees on the floor, on the heating units, and in the windowsills.  A live grasshopper was on my bed.  Again.  I was on the 4th floor.

The bed in the room with the TV was broken.  When my guest sat on it, I truly thought she was going to flip off the bed as it sank so far down, so quickly.

After maybe 20 minutes total, I could no longer justify the extreme expense of my room ($630 for two nights).  When I went down to the Clerk, I asked for a manager, and she came up quickly.  I briefly explained my concerns and without hesitation, she said she would cancel my room.  While I was pleased with this resolution, it seemed odd that the immediate response was simply to remove me from the hotel rather than find a more acceptable room.  This leads me to believe this is a common occurrence.

Overall, I would give this hotel 0 stars if I could.  I've read other reviews of this hotel and am floored by those who had a pleasant stay.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJdUxQNlRnEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Silverado+Franklin+Historic+Hotel+%26+Gaming+Complex,+Legends+Steakhouse+%26+Silverado+Grand+Buffet/@42.1195729,-113.2883483,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x5332a6a074a974d1:0xb9438f5b159e64d!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d44.3755516!4d-103.7311272!16s%2Fg%2F11bw_7ly1h?hl=en",ChIJ0XSpdKCmMlMRTeZZsfU4lAs,Hotel,1.0,"Silverado Franklin Historic Hotel & Gaming Complex, Legends Steakhouse & Silverado Grand Buffet",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWIOTiAbEp-6HCwUrBaMeYD6ISHXBIhw0FbRPb=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"Hotel rooms are not great. They have not been updated since the early 1900s. The room my family and I stayed in had 2 bedrooms and a kitchen room that had the sink drains covered with a sign saying "" Do not use sink "". The bedrooms didn't have doors. The only bathroom was very small and was in the room with the two beds. The king bedroom used to have a bathroom but the door was locked with a table pushed up against it. In the entry room there was a big closet room where the king bathroom used to be,  which obviously was not useable. The entry door wouldn't lock. I had to stick a folded up card behind the door lock to make it latch properly. I was worried about a fire in the old building. I made sure I knew where the fire escapes were. One was out of a window in the main hallway that led to the fire escape stairway. Room left a lot of room for improvement.
The gambling hall was old but had some new remodeled bathrooms with gold bars and new tile.
The dining room downstairs was very nice. Newer design features with newer bathrooms too.

"I was excited to stay at this haunted hotel until I checked into the hotel. The lady at the check-in deck, didn't get her name, was upset and rude when I asked if I could stay in one of the haunted rooms. This is how our convo went:

Her response: ""we don't have any. Because we aren't haunted.""

My response: ""oh that's not what I read online.""

Her response: ""Idk where you read that because this hotel isn't haunted.""

Keep in mind she is saying this as a total Karen.

My response (joking tone): ""weird. Better not tell you the website then (laugh.)""

Her response: ""no you better go ahead and tell me the website so we can get it taken down. Tell me now. What is it?""

Me: ""idk the website""

Her as I walk outside to get my bags from the car: grabs phone to probably look up website.

"Ate at the buffet only; no gambling or hotel. Our server was very nice and kept us refilled on drinks and the plates cleaned from the table. The food overall was good and there was a nice selection. I loved the Brussels sprouts casserole. We had plenty of good crab through the whole meal. The prime rib was cooked perfectly.
They have a brick oven for the pizza and ironically the pizza on the buffet looked awful. Dried out, burnt and unappetizing.
The tables were arranged in such a way that we were very close to the table next to us which happened to have two people who talked way too loud. They were SO annoying after just a few mins. The waiter even commented on them after they thankfully left.

Looks like a well maintained‚Äã golf course. It has a nice clubhouse and OK RV park for peaple traveling. I'm not a golfer but I stayed at the RV park.  I saw how well they kept up the golf course.  I stayed in the RV park for two months.  They did not seem good at managing the RV park and at times the management didn't know who was even there.  At times they didn't even dump the trash cans. They sometimes went days without doing this and only dumped them oafter they started overflowing. The golf course was well kept but there was lots of weeds around the RV spaces.  Electrical is included but daily space rates seem high for what they have to offer. This was NOT a dog friendly RV park. They have very poor WiFi service.  They had no laundry facilities.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBbnNMd29BRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Riverside+Golf+Club+%26+Bistro+(Including+The+Rooftop+Bar)/@47.1206069,-125.4140854,8z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x5493e0255dc5e9d7:0xb2c62e38e1f6e65f!8m2!3d46.6744239!4d-122.9895987!16s%2Fg%2F1tdrx0cz?hl=en",ChIJ1-nFXSXgk1QRX-b24TguxrI,Golf course,3.0,Riverside Golf Club & Bistro (Including The Rooftop Bar),https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdCT2iU-tPfGVeA1Ym8Y5-9yfGdfZkPZZPjHNP=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"This park pays homage to a lot of great shows that older people and younger have had in their lives. Seeing some of your favorite childhood friends being represented by a roller coaster and/or a giant version of them is amazing.

A lot of the rides are underwhelming but there are a few that really stand above the rest. It's obvious that Spongebob's Rock bottom is really a highlight attraction for the park. With not only the most excitement offered for a ride there and with it's intimate connection to the episode of spongebob it's derived from. Up until my attempt to ride this attraction I was super impressed with the staff's ability to load people on rides and keep everything flowing well. The attendant at the spongebob ride was either very ill or extremely hungover. Every step seeming like an even heavier burden on him. Watching a coaster fly around for a minute and then waiting till just before he needs to open the gate to take long drinks out of a water bottle. And some of the slowest checking for seat belts and safety things being in place I've ever seen. Ironically another concern is his ability to pay attention to what he needs to because he just seemed so out of it.

Paying the minimum amount for a wristband to share with my family to go on a few rides is still 54$. After a day of spending too much money at other stores and trying to end it with some great characters and rides we cherish, we left disappointed.

"Needs better training for staff.  My 3 and 5 year olds love Adventure Bay and brought them there for the 5+  times since it open.¬† However, I observed something very concerning yesterday that needs to be¬†addressed to the teenage workers.¬†Better training for all staff.

There were still time to play, but some families were leaving. The worker was kind enough to open the exit gate for people to leave, but then at one point, a kid no more than two years old walked towards the gate and he opened it to allow the kid to leave on his own. The staff wasn't paying attention at all to who he was letting out. The parent was busy with her other child who was still inside. As you know, the place gets super busy for parents to keep an eye on every children and she could have done better too, but how does an employee just let a small child leave on their own without an adult!! Right before I was going to address this, (I had two children who were still in the playground to watch as well), the mother finally realized it and ran to her child who was at least 10 yards away thru the gate in a very busy area.¬† When I addressed this with the teenage employee, he seemed very clueless about his action and did not understand the magnitude for his mistake. I get that other families were leaving, but this child was a completely different race, so even that should have at least alerted him that he should not open the gate for a kid that is by himself.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzdDVEckN3EAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nickelodeon+Universe%C2%AE/@44.8547397,-97.8562833,7z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x87f624366fd51ad9:0xe2c5bc99e5482bb5!8m2!3d44.8547397!4d-93.2420255!16zL20vMDFwdF9r?hl=en",ChIJ2RrVbzYk9ocRtStI5Zm8xeI,Theme park,2.0,Nickelodeon Universe¬Æ,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOo7HD40FqKgi1yVjAqFWpvz2XrNUzNTiBaN4TD=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"Three wristbands were purchased for this visit. For the most part this was a very good visit. I've been here multiple times with my kids. Usually, with my two older ones. I did bring the two year old almost three year old this time. We did decide to go on the Dora Azul Train ride pretty basic right.  She met all the requirements for the ride, but I soon realized I may need to accompany her on the ride. I assume the attendant would understand and allow me to ride with my daughter, no that was not the case.
I was told NO!! Unless, I brought a ticket. I said, ""she not going to stay seated she doesn't understand you."" The attendant still say no and started the ride. My daughter stood up the attendant had to get on the mic and tell her to sit down and I said again she doesn't understand you. Can I now get on the ride and he said yes.
I soon realized I may need to go talk to a manager so I can let them know what is going on and get permission for the kids rides as chaperone capacity but was that's not possible. I got frustrated and blurted out that she is on the Spectrum which I wanted to avoid in the first place.
My issue is that if a parent tells someone that a kid needs a chaperone, that parent shouldn't have throw more money to your establishment to keep that kid safe.

"Auntie had the BEST Sunday Fun-day date with her Godson at this place! I'd never been to Nickelodeon Universe so didn't know what to expect but it was a definitely a blast. My little guy is 5. There are tons of rides and activities for him (some you can even hop on as chaperone without an upcharge!). The line to the play area was a wait so be prepared but for most of the others the wait isn't too bad. One tip: avoid the Caribou. The staff are not trained to manage a coffee shop and that was the longest wait we had all day for a simple coffee cooler. There's a Starbucks at the opposite end of the park. Just get there before the line gets too long! You will need caffeine to keep up with your littles! Loved the Dora Ferris Wheel, Crazy Car and Bus for the kids. And the Ninja Turtles made an appearance for pictures, at no extra cost! Points band are reasonable and there are many options.

"Thanks for the great stay Hyatt Eden!!  A group of us drove from Winnipeg to Minneapolis to catch a Vikings game. We were concerned this hotel was too far away but it didn‚Äôt turn out to be an issue. It‚Äôs easy enough to drive around the city. Maybe took us half hour to get downtown. The Harley store, Target and Menards are close to the hotel so that was nice.

The rooms are big!! King Bed comfy, shower pressure great and lots of hot water!!!  Pull out sofa.
Could have easily had 4 adts share the king room.

Front staff check in was pleasant. They didn‚Äôt realize we were all traveling together so they ended up placing us on different floors. But that was our fault for not speaking up.
We also didn‚Äôt speak up about having a room away from the elevators. It was annoying to be woken up super early from guests checking out and kids running up and down the hallway etc. By the elevator. Things yah just don‚Äôt think about sometimes.

"I finally got a chance to check this place out. Most of the barcades are in Charlotte so it's nice to have one close to home. I went on a Thursday night which is ""guys night"" and was welcomed as soon as I walked in, both the owners and the guests were very friendly. For Thursdays, about all games were free (at least for dudes) except for pinball, which were .50 a game. Normally it's $5 a person for unlimited play and pinball is $1.00 a game (ouch to $1.00 pinball!). There were maybe 6 to 12 people rotating in and out while I was there, so not crowded at all. Parking was abundant. It's about a 5 minute walk from Freeman's. Bar can turn cash to quarters or can give you quarters from your bar tab for a 10% surcharge. Bar had food and drinks at fair prices. There are 2 gender neutral restrooms. There are a few TV's playing sports and comic book movies and YouTube videos. Place was open until midnight on a weeknight which was cool. There was one tv hooked up to a Nintendo 64 with a pretty large assortment of games. There were a couple party/board games sitting near a table. There was a fairly large area for outdoor seating as well. I think what made this visit special was how friendly the owners and guests were, felt like you were just visiting old friends instead of strangers.

EDIT: Citycade did a reconfiguration and brought in a racing game, a shooting game, a beer pong game and a couple of pay to win games disguised as games of skill. I believe at this point they've gotten rid of the $5 cover entirely and just made the machines take quarters, which I think was a good move. Pinball is still a buck which is a bummer since there are better options out there for $.50 a game, but it's close to home at least and the price point isn't uncommon. Pinball seems maintained and Citycade has occasionally swapped out for different pins, which is nice. Bathrooms are always clean which is a plus. Only complaint is that sometimes it can get a bit hot in the building.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdmFxUllnEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/CityCade+Classic+Arcade+and+Pinball+Game+Bar,+Gastonia+NC/@35.2341215,-81.0537741,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8856c1b3a8efdad9:0xd240e10ee1ba3f55!8m2!3d35.2632135!4d-81.1797882!16s%2Fg%2F11j7k_xln2?hl=en",ChIJ2drvqLPBVogRVT-64Q7hQNI,Bar,5.0,"CityCade Classic Arcade and Pinball Game Bar, Gastonia NC",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOYNN5y6gNITGaKA6YxbJtiodU2YD_0tsylVxD=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

Great fun for the family. If you're local you'll want a membership for planetarium discounts. They change up the sky shows every so often. This last show we went to in April was actually boring and I fell asleep but they did the Carolina sky afterwards and it was Great! They actual museum is just the right size. They have manual wheelchairs but my mother didn't feel she needed one she used her walker and it was ok. Although we didn't travel all over it was a good little tour of the facility. My child always has fun here.  If you're strapped for cash every 2nd Tuesday of the month is free after 4pm. Facility closes at 5.

"I stopped to visit the museum while I was in the area. It has many exhibits that are typical of a natural history museum such as dinosaurs, minerals/rocks, eco system displays, birds, bugs, and other animals. It had an American Indian section and a specific North Carolina area which I thought were neat. There were also live animals in some places and I wasnt expecting that. The creepy house and exhibition was very interesting to me because it was based on a real person's experience finding out what was true or false in nature.

"This is pretty cool place. I have 3 boys between the ages of 2-8 yrs old. The dinosaur exhibits were nice, with sounds and short films. The children's hands on vet/archiology clinic was super cool. The pirate ship was fun. We didn't get to do the planetarium because.. let's face it. My 2 year old wouldn't sit through it. They have small live animals to check out too like a possum, snakes, parie dog and turtles. On the back side of the building there's pigs and sheeps. There's a trail with a pond and other things.

"I live directly up the street from this place on Washington Ave and I have got to say that I am absolutely disappointed with their quality of food.  Today, I just recently ordered their Pad Kee Mao and it looked like someone chewed up the meal and spit it right back out into the carry out tray.  The noodles were overly soggy and mushed up like mashed potatoes.  The salad that comes with the Lunch looks as if someone cut out a large chunk from a piece of lettuce, threw it into the tray, and then decided to splash a little sauce on top of it.

I don't normally complain about food and most times I simply ignore the mistakes but I've been living in Bellevue for 3 years now and this incident has happened more than once.  A customer can only be patient so many times and then there comes a point where a enough is enough.  This restaurant will never receive my services ever again.  I don't know if it's the cook or the management but the quality of food is poor.  Years ago the food was much better. I'm not sure what happened between then and now.

If you want a quality restaurant for Thai food, go to Niky's Thai Kitchen.  I promise you, Niky's Thai Kitchen is the better choice.  Their food quality is suburb compared to Thai Tamarind, especially for the price you'll pay for it.

"Well, it wasn't anywhere NEAR as good as a few years back but the presentation was decent. Of course the prices went up, lol. An almost 3 star. Almost. Sadly I can NOT recommend  Thai Tamarind any longer since the flavors were incredibly weak and/or bland; so much tasted like it came from a jar and the top of the line ""thai spicy"" was a powder they sprinkled on top of every dish when presenting your level of spicy. Some of the powder hadn't fully dissolved during your meal so you would gets little clumps of it in your mouth. The ""so-called"" Thai Iced Tea I had tasted as if it were a syrup from a bottle. Yech!

Pictured you have the Tom Yum soup, Volcano Chicken and the Thai Style Chicken Noodle. All bland and weak. Not pictured but as an appetizer we had the chicken satay, another huge let down since when eaten with a homemade peanut sauce or cucumber sauce, it is DELICIOUS! The peanut sauce seems to have some type of dairy added to it. Gross.

Seated WAY in the back corner in the last pic you'll see your ""typical American Ken"", who did nothing but complain from he moment he sat down. Entitled as ""F"".

"SUPERB AUTHENTIC THAI in the Pittsburgh area, a short 15 min drive from downtown.  Cozy restaurant with no-touch menu, short and sweet. It looks a popular spot to locals of many persuasions. Takeout or sit in (I have done both), it‚Äôs simply excellent food. A FOODIE‚ÄôS GEM.

Start with Fresh Rolls and Fried Eggplant, contrasting but complementary textures and sweet tangy sauces that wake up the palate (very much unlike the cliche peanut sauce in the run of mill Thai-style places.

Any of the curry entrees are very good, smooth well-balanced sauces; none of that pungent sugar-loaded curry so common in so-called Thai restaurants in this town.

My recommendation: Duck Curry, very crispy well seasoned perfectly cooked duck atop the smooth Red curry with bell peppers and cherry tomatoes, carefully balanced with two halves of lychee just enough to brighten the palate: Simply Wow!

Pair the curry with any of the Thai stir fry veggies.  I‚Äôm partial to the Hot Basil fry, extra veggies (natural sweetness of the fresh vegetables complemented with their brown sauce).

By the way, enjoy Thai food with a spoon rather than fork/knife. Spoon the curry or veggies on rice, mix, then enjoy. Spoon allows one to taste every drop of the sauce.

"I had high expectations for this property based on its category and price range. It did not deliver in accordance to its value and how it was advertised. The room I was initially given was not properly cleaned. There were clear signs that the fitted sheet was not laundered. I had to switch rooms, which unfortunately was a downgrade, and there were cleanliness issues in that room as well. The room amenities were lacking, which again is surprising based on category and price. The spa was closed, as well as the hot tub. Those items played a big role in my decision, so I was quite disappointed to find out they were closed. Why didn't the price and category reflect these changes. They are being very misleading, and that's enough to turn me away from Marriott properties. My main concern is they are still advertising as if they have everything together during these times and are charging inflated prices. I am highly upset I did not receive what was expected and now feel like my money put into this property is a major loss. The only thing that was nice is the customer service of the front office staff. The lady taking our breakfast room service order was a little off putting. There was a mistake made with my order. I called to let her know but she seemed upset at me for letting her know their mistake. It was corrected, but her tone was unsettling. The toast was overcooked and stale. Everything else, the omelet, pancakes, chicken sausage, bacon, and potatoes, was made fine.

"I've stayed at a lot of Marriotts because of business trips in the past 10 years. They usually don't fall below a certain standard, but it seems in this case they did.

The rooms were pricey and we had booked a room with 2 queen beds and they gave us a room with a king and a sofa bed. Now you might think of this as an upgrade if you had a couple booking the room, but this was for 3 people and getting a sofa bed when you have paid for a queen. When i mentioned this in the app, they said they would fix it the next day and they did, and they have us the room right next to ours which made for a very easy transfer through the connecting door, which is what raised my review from 1 star to 2.

I suspect they changed our booking because they were having a convention and needed the room but this isn't an acceptable reason.

Other things that bothered me were the cleanliness of the rooms. I attached a couple of photos showing what our floor was like in the first room and the dirt inside the coffee maker. In both rooms, the coffee makers were terrible with one even having hair in it.

Finally it saddens me to see a sad attempt to look progressive with 3 places to charge an electric car. 2 Tesla spots of which 1 was it of order and 1 for non Tesla electric cars.

If you want to add electric car charging to your hotel add 10 spots not have a token amount and not even functional

I think they rely on the event housing so much they don't really care about their amenities is status of their rooms so much. Because every night we were there they had all least 2 events going on.

For the price and the quality, might as well just stay in mystic close to everything.

The rooms were very modern and upscale. Very clean, staff was very friendly and offering assistance throughout our stay. They have a buffet breakfast that was better than any hotel I've ever stayed in. It was real fresh food not that processed stale taste. A chef makes omletes with your fillings right in front of you. They have a upscale restaurant called the OCTAGON it is pricey but well worth it. We had ours delivered via room service!! Their filet mignon is to die for.

Good food at a great price. We had the hash and the American specials.  The corned beef hash tasted homemade.  We had the rye toast and the raisin toast.  Both were toasted to perfection.  My husband said the Coffee was excellent.  I'll take his word on that.  I guess I never grew up enough to like coffee.

"I love the Peppermill. They have great food with surprising variety at low prices. I had the inside out grilled cheese. It has baby Swiss, cheddar, tomato, red onion, and avocado on parmesan crusted bread. It was amazing. The onion was flavorful and the creamy avocado made the two melted cheeses even better. The parmesan added another layer of crispness to each bite. I upgraded to tater tots instead of chips, and I was surprised at the large portion. My daughter had a pancake and tots. The pancake was huge, so she only managed half, but she did polish off her tots and some of mine. This was my second time there recently.

Really nice everything brand new really big but long-term price won‚Äôt work. We definitely will be going to the other trampoline places then to come here because of the prices. Arcade is over priced for what you can win. Which is like that almost everywhere. I do love that they have so many couches and lots of areas for the parents to sit and watch kids. Oh and you have to have non-grip socks and they don‚Äôt tell you that when you come in and they do not have prices for the Sox listed on their board either. They are three dollars a pair of socks and they don‚Äôt have any deals on them like if you buy multiple or a pack or anything to save money which is kind of crazy because if I knew beforehand I could‚Äôve bought some online for way cheaper from somewhere else. I like that you have to wear a electronic wristband that has a green and red light to tell you when your time is up. Everything is very Clean because it is a brand new building and equipment.

At Hang Time I'm always worried about where my smaller kids are because you can't keep a good eye everywhere. Feels like it's for older kids and young adults with more trampolines for tricks.

What I like about The Hive it's good for kids of all ages. There's a tetherball with jumping around it. Two interactive video game screens that actually show their picture on screen as they jump, so fun!
Zip line, jumping basketball, targets, go carts (costs extra), the biggest bounce house/obstacle course I've ever seen. Regular trampolines too, rock wall, ninja warrior obstacles, slack line.

There are drinking fountains, but they're by the go carts (kind of annoying they're so far).
They also have bands to wear that have lights that change color when your time is up. They do have lockers as well.

"We LOVE western Wyoming's Little America! This was the first Little America we ever visited (over two years ago) and it is our favorite by far! (Little America Flagstaff is a close second.) We've never stayed at the hotel, but the travel center is excellent!

The shower rooms are always spotless and so cozy, each having its own huge, glass-doored, tile shower, and a separate soaking tub as an added bonus that we always look forward to. Showers are $12, and they provide mineral bath gel, bars of soap, and plenty of clean, warm towels. We stop solely for the amazing showers, but stick around a little longer for the food.

The grill has exceeded our expectations as far as a travel center food stop goes - the menu is kinda limited, but they have several different choices, from burgers to breakfast to fried chicken. The food is made to order and everything we've had has been so delicious. (My personal favorite is the breakfast burrito with sausage gravy.) The grill is also open 24 hours a day and serving everything on the menu all day long. Sure beats a basic fast food stop at any of the other travel centers!

In our experience, the staff at this location have been very friendly, welcoming, and happy to meet whatever need that arises, round the clock. If you're a trucker, get here early (or super late night) if you hope to find a parking spot. This is the last travel stop for a while if you're eastbound, and the veteran drivers already know how awesome this place is, so the lot fills up quick and there's usually a ton of create-a-spot tetris going on come nightfall.

The Little America experience is never short of amazing for us, and so memorable that every time we leave we can hardly wait until our next visit! Plus, they have a great view from the parking lot.

"Hotel is extremely outdated and staff needs to brush up on their customer service skills. The property probably hasn't had any sort of renovation since the 90's and it is long overdue. I was offered a package when I checked in which included a discount if I spent $30 in the gift shop/restaurant/gas station. I was told to bring back my receipts and they would apply the discount. The next morning I went into the front desk with my receipts only to be told I needed to turn them in the night before. I told the front desk attendant that I was not informed that it had to be turned in the same day I checked in, only to bring my receipts back and the front desk lady would take off the discount.  The front desk attendant rudely said,  ""yeah her and she's not here"". I then asked for a manager who quickly resolved the problem. If you're going to have a strict policy on how long customers have to turn in receipts for credits on a package I didn't even ask for then you need to inform the customers of that policy.

"Nicest roach motel I've stayed at.  It looks cute and quaint from a distance, but don't be fooled into booking a room there.  AC was not adequate.  Had to leave the sliding patio door open for air, which was really hard to move because it was off its rollers.  It was also not secure because the patio is shared with every room on that side of the building.  The room was not clean.  There was trash left from the previous occupant: receipt in the dresser, pizza crust under the bed, comb on the bathroom sink, and water in the ice bucket.  There was a brown crusty substance on the edge of the bathroom garbage can.  The bed sheets were too short and because I'm tall my feet were rubbing on the rough protective pad underneath.  Both beds were like that but I was the only one tall enough to notice.  The map of the grounds they gave us was a bad copy and it was hard to read the amenities.  I thought there might be a nicer version in the amenities book in the room but the book had nothing in it at all.  This means we knew nothing about the hotel other than what was on the bad map.  We didn't have any phone numbers to call for service or if it was possible to order food from the restaurant.  We went in the pool, which had several places where it had cracked and was missing chunks of concrete and tiles.  The deep end separation floaters were all destroyed and were held up by the rope.  We avoided several bad sections of the pool due to it's horrible condition.  When we checked out in the morning it was so early (6:15 AM) that we had to check out at the gift shop and the staff there were not pleasant.  This was also where you payed for gas, and it had the restaurant in it.  The restaurant menu was horrible.  I couldn't order anything due to the limited menu.

Small bathtub. 3. Short shower. If your tall your going to have to bend to get your head under the shower. 4. Pillows got rock hard after laying on them for a few minutes 5. Very few phone charger stations.

They do serve buffalo burgers in the convenient store and the do have a small restaurant in the hotel lobby.

"I thought my mom and I would have really enjoyed this restaurant, but we were a bit underwhelmed and feel that Le Reve in Tosa and Pastiche in downtown are better options in Milwaukee for French cuisine.

Things we liked:
‚Äîthe view of Lake Michigan
‚Äîfree parking!
‚Äîthe butter (kinda random, but it was really good!)
‚Äîthe wine pairings for the Menu de Chef
‚Äîthe service from our waiter‚Äôs assistant (I think her name was Michelle)
‚Äîmy dessert, which was an Earl Grey pot de creme with honey brittle and lavender chantilly creme. The bright, lemony Riesling was a perfect pair.

Things we didn‚Äôt care for:
‚Äîour waiter made the same spiel for the specials at every table and became a broken record.
‚Äîthe soup l‚Äôoignon was so-so, a little too sweet
‚Äîthe entrees could have used more vegetables to brighten up the plate
‚Äîmy filet was well-done when I ordered it rare, but they were quick to fix that
‚Äînoisy in our room and was difficult to maintain conversation
‚Äîwe got a bit of a pretentious air to the place

Overall, this place was nice, but didn‚Äôt knock our socks off.

"LPB has been our favorite for a long time and we we're thrilled to learn they re-opened. The service was stellar and VERY safe however we were not quite thrilled with our  food. It was almost as if the kitchen has an entirely new staff.. perhaps new suppliers/wholesalers??  My Oeuf Mollet avec Champignons des Bois was prepared differently, the mussels were definitely different. And my favorite fois gras dish has a new bland fruit or vegetable to accompany it vs the old one which was a sweet fruit that was such a great compliment to such a savory protein. Lastly,  I had a lobster entree that was prepared in a ""beef stock"" like base... Almost like it should have accompanied beef vs. fresh lobster. I hate to sound harsh but I am just being honest.  And FYI the menu is now a set 3 or 4 course menu. We will certainly come back however having eaten here so many times for so many special occasions.. we were a bit disappointed compared to any previous visit.  One last note.. just a thought... Why is it I cannot find a desert chef in Milwaukee who makes Panna Cotta? The last time we found it was at Chistopher's (now closed/new owner perhaps) in Sister Bay.

"Really enjoyed our visit here. We came here for the annual fall mushroom dinner and got to taste a great spread of delicacies and unique mushrooms. We enjoyed about 18 different mushrooms blended into our 6 course meals paired with wine! Everything was delicious.

This was our first time here and glad we decided to be here to enjoy the special evening. We got seated right away and the staff were so polite. We also had some food restrictions and our server attended to us right away addressing that. He just made us feel very comfortable and ensured us that the request has been taken care off.

We visited here for dinner but I would love to visit here again during the day because based on the location, it overlooks the beautiful Lake Michigan and I can only imagine how gorgeous the view would be from the hill top! It's an upscale restaurant and is great for special occasions! They offer a lot of speciality themed dinners (just like the mushroom one) so I would really recommend joining in for one of those if you get a chance!

"Myself and 5 friends went tonight to celebrate our good friend's engagement and wedding coming up next month with something a little different! We had an amazing time, the food was totally different than what we normally would find but so good, we had a ton of fun picking out our meals, trying all the different things, and just enjoying the experience. The wait staff was phenomenal, I honestly think Allison was a highlight of our evening. She was very personable, made us feel entirely comfortable, and had great tips and information on the menu.

We were gifted with extras at dessert, champagne for those of us that partook in cocktails and N/A sparkling juice for those that didn't and it was SO good! Super refreshing! We also (seriously, they were so amazing) were gifted a bite of something delicious - I apologize for not remembering what it was by the pastry chef this evening - but it had almonds, was a dessert bar of some sort and it was really good - not super sweet, honestly would have gone great with coffee if any of us had room for it - which we most certainly did not.

The atmosphere was wonderful, even being in proximity to other tables it still felt intimate enough that we couldn't hear other parties' conversations, nor could they hear ours, and I feel like we were a little rambunctious at times. Also, my friends that had cocktails said nothing but high praise for them - my coke with lime was also top notch * in case anyone cared ;)

Food. That's why you're reading this, yeah?
It was good. Like, really great. It also felt like a performance at times. Lots of fun pouring, super attentive taking items away, never once had to ask for anything, be it water, napkin, silverware, etc etc. Maybe we're cheap dates but I'm fairly certain everyone went above and beyond, exceeding our expectations. Thanks for a great experience!

In case my photo captions don't save:
1. Scallops
2. Surprise Carrot & Cardamom Soup option (big fan of this, you don't know unless you KNOW)
3. Beef Medallion Filet - my favorite of the 3 savory dishes
4. The best dang dessert option there is - even though the mousse looked and sounded amazing - I will DIE on this chocolatey-citrus hill any day. Any. Day. This chocolate cake (better than the chocolate cake in your head, bet) and orange sorbet - beyond.

"It's been a few years since we have stayed here and unfortunately will probably be the last time. I received an email inviting me to stay there which stated they had newly remodeled rooms, which made us want to go ahead and book here instead of our usual other option. Well, our visit was less than satisfying. We drove up Sunday afternoon to check in and were told there was no valet service - park across the street, and walk back to check in (was not allowed to keep my car in their driveway while checking in). Not a good start. Check in line had about 10 parties waiting to check in and only two front desk folks (after about 10 minutes one more front desk agent showed up). Once in the room, I was confused how they could state the rooms were remodeled(?). Bathroom was great (only one hook to hang towels), the room was painted, but the furniture was still old and scratched up, the chair was creaking with every move and the thermostat was very dirty (not huge, but very noticeable). The casino had no live tables, so we had to go somewhere else to play - I prefer to just stay in my hotel to gamble. As far as the 'Resort Fee', it lists 2 water bottles (helpful on a 100 degree day), but never got that - I called down to see if they could be brought over and never got them. There were a couple of coffee pods with a sign stating they will be refreshed every morning, they are not. I called the 2nd morning to get a couple, but ended up running to Starbucks instead (Why are they charging a resort fee???). If this covers the parking, maybe think about charging the people parking in your lot and not staying at your hotel.
In any case, with all the alternative hotels in Reno I will not be booking another room at Circus Circus. I'll keep the old memories of what they used to be years ago.

"Stopped by for a few hours on our way to Cali. I have memories of being here as a child and seeing animals and circus acts. I took my kids in and found the arcade with the stage.

It was fun gambling at Circus Circus. The sports book was small and did not have much of a selection of games on but it was okay. I ended up winning on the table games and on a few sporting events. They also had the midway with all the arcade games and carnival games. The kids enjoyed it and was a great spot to take them.

"Goods. Room was clean, working personnel nice, friendly and helpful from front desk to security and housekeeping, has a fym/fitness center, nice location, staying here pretty much gets you access to 3 casinos with a walking distance to Reno signature sign.
Bad stuff.
LINES ! If you there on the weekend when everyone else is there well let's say this place can't handle it's own capacity. To check in long line, to get to your room at certain  times there is a (no joking) 40 minutes wait line for elevator, now  it's not always but try to get back to your room when you really need something can be frustrating time in line for elevator.
Noise, I am talking hotel room, you can hear a lot from rooms nextdoor and hallway.
Bathroom!  Now that could be subjective but bathtub is very small, shower pipes makes loud noise while waiting for hot water and sink makes loud bubbly noises after use.
That's all major points. You can have great time staying there if you do it on not busy days, but if you have regular schedule and go there when most of people do, you might get frustrated standing in 40 minutes line for elevator when you just need to go to your room little quick.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMHZXUmFnEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Circus+Circus+Reno/@38.1399101,-128.4934264,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x809947369a6d96f1:0x8a35778e09b46c3e!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.5314464!4d-119.8157093!16zL20vMDVnNTAx?hl=en",ChIJ8ZZtmjZHmYARPmy0CY53NYo,Hotel,3.0,Circus Circus Reno,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOV3RPvxn-HupPql21Uni5wTZRo1bzyu0KYFMRk=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"I haven't been to Las  Vegas but if you have limited time and you are heading to San Francisco or  bay area and if casino is in your bucket list then you definitely need to add Reno to your list. We went on Saturday night and all the casinos were filled. We stayed in circus circus, it's one of the casino among the three giants which hosts its own casino. A perfect place to stay and enjoy in a casino.
Easy check-in and check out.Rooms were good, what else one might in need of. One drawback which I thought is number of boards were very less and casinos were all filled with digital ones which seems to be slightly bothering. All the bar and restaurant were good. Even if you want to take a walk , best time is to go after 10PM . You can have a good view of the lights .
The row is all integrated and you can move between all the 3 casinos . They too have play area like arcade games for little kids . Please note children are not allowed inside the casino .  You need to have alternate arrangements for that.

Maybe something happened there before I don't know, but I felt this odd coldness/a feeling that made me uneasy. I was hesitant to stay here but I decided to book again since I was only here for a couple days.

My 2nd visit this past week was decent. The hotel itself is older of course, but it gives the basic necessities. I was in the sky tower this time and it felt more updated than the casino tower?

Heating/cooling system worked perfectly. I had a corner room which had a nice view of the city.

I would give this rating a lot lower for the incident that happened, but I will assume it was a rare occurrence where someone walks in your room without knocking. The woman Apologized, but I felt really uncomfortable because I could've been naked or in the shower. It was totally inappropriate, I messaged the concierge Ivy person thing and they apologized but never offered to do anything...

Water quality from the faucets were questionable, I ran the hot and cold and both looked heavy, see photo. But cleared up after I ran it for some time.

Shower ran well too. Water temp was well controlled. So everything else was fine with the room. Nothing extravagant, I just got a normal king size room.

Anyways, I like the convenience of the hotels location and how it's connected to the other, Silver Legacy, el Dorado, etc. We enjoy the arcade and circus shows too. Staff are friendly for the most part. They have a better food court now than they did 12 years ago, so there are improvements here and there.

I love that they still have a lot of old mixed with new. I love the history of the buildings and seeing that throughout the halls and rooms of the buildings. Please maintain the history  I think that's what really entices visitors too!

Overall I would stay again for the location for sure.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteDhYQlRREAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Circus+Circus+Reno/@38.1399101,-128.4934264,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x809947369a6d96f1:0x8a35778e09b46c3e!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.5314464!4d-119.8157093!16zL20vMDVnNTAx?hl=en",ChIJ8ZZtmjZHmYARPmy0CY53NYo,Hotel,3.0,Circus Circus Reno,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCZ--N_l0ZFtv1vPawGZHKfTD4R0pU3HNDrLhm=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"Our experience here was awesome! My boyfriend and I did 'The Lost Ship' room. It was a Wednesday 7pm booking, so just the two of us took on the challenge without anyone else booking in. And we escaped with 90 seconds to spare!! Our guide, Captain Charles, did a fantastic job introducing the room to us with this whole back story to set us up. If you pay close attention, there are clues in everything he's saying as well.

The room itself was the best part. It was actually several rooms all joined together and from the lobby you had to figure out how to even enter the main room in the first place‚Äîsuper cool! I had never seen anything like that before. The puzzles were also really well thought out and interesting, using logic and problem solving (not at all abstract or random). Of all the escape rooms I have done, I would say that this has been the best experience I have had because of the attention to detail in the room, the quality of the puzzles, and the experience of being able to solve it with just the two of us.

The room is actually designed for at least 6 people, because it would have been helpful for others to take on and simultaneously solve riddles in the room. I'm pretty amazed we were able to do it with just 2 (but it was mostly because we had a few timely hints... big ones, lol). Awesome experience, highly recommend!!!

P.S. - This location has only this room (Pirate's Booty 2 - The Lost Ship), and the other rooms are in their downtown location.

"We were lucky enough to get a private tour thanks to a GHA/Omni Local Experience and really enjoyed meeting its Director, Patti Clark.The Zoo has the admirable mission of 'not existing at all' since without abused, injured and abandoned animals to rescue, it wouldn't need to be here.

Patti could relay every story of each animal on our tour, and although many of its inhabitants were transfers from closed pet stores and zoos, the majority were exotic pets from owners who never considered what happens when a bear, panther or alligator grows up. This zoo is the final destination for these animals where they get to live out the rest of their days without transfer.

While there are no giraffes, polar bears or theme park rides, there's an enthusiastic and friendly staff caring for several hundred animals that otherwise most likely would have been euthanized. This non-profit is continuously building new enclosures and facilities and hosts daily programs and talks for kids and adults alike, in its effort to house animals from the 40-50 calls they get every month.

"A nice rescue zoo a short drive from downtown ATX.

This zoo isn't extremely big or fancy, but you can tell they care about the animals. The animals are taken in from bad situations and rehabilitated and cared for.

The exhibits have educational material about the species of animals, but also about each individual animals situation and how they ended up being cared for by the zoo.

This is a much different experience than a big zoo, it's a lot quieter and less crowded if that's what you are looking for. It's also kind cheated more affordable than a big zoo.

The train could be improved with running more often than once an hour on high volume days. The animals looked mostly health.

Since there‚Äôs so many trees, it was shaded basically the entire zoo, which is a must in the Texas sun.

Also, since the animals are rescued, they weren‚Äôt hiding like they do in normal zoos. We went as soon as they open, and everyone was out and about in their exhibits.

"DON‚ÄôT GO IF YOUR CHILD WON‚ÄôT WEAR A MASK!

My friend and I and our four children, ages 4,3,2 and 7 months visited the Austin Zoo earlier this week.
The good: It is so classic Austin. Nestled on a hillside on the outskirts of town amidst lots of cedar trees, there were no paved walkways. I loved it. You can get through it in about an hour and feel like you didn‚Äôt miss much, which is great with small children. They have a fun interactive petting zoo and peacocks roaming around all over. Love it!
The not-so-good: I confess most of this is due to my comparison experience with the zoo in my city- South Bend, IN (home of Mayor Pete Buttegieg). Our zoo is about comparable in size and number and type of animals. We also have no elephants, but we do have rhinos and will be getting giraffes soon. The surprising part of this is that South Bend is about a tenth of the size of Austin. I think maybe the Austin Zoo wants only rescue animals, and there aren‚Äôt rescue elephants...I don‚Äôt know. There are also a lot more cages at the Austin Zoo whereas South Bend has created much more natural habitats for most of their animals.
By far the biggest, most frustrating difference, however, was the mask policy. In the South Bend Zoo, and most places, you are only required to wear masks inside or if you can‚Äôt social distance. (FYI I am VERY pro-mask, but within reason). This even includes the animal feeding area in the South Bend Zoo. In Austin everyone, including small children 2 and over, are required to wear masks even outdoors (which is the entire zoo basically) unless you are eating. On a windy day from 20 feet away the chances of passing on Covid are so low even the CDC wouldn‚Äôt require this. It seems so unlikely Covid could be passed on to people or animals in that scenario. The Austin Zoo seemed possibly more concerned about their animals catching Covid than people, and I haven‚Äôt read about animals becoming seriously ill with Covid.
Wearing masks for adults I do not believe is much to ask, but for my friend‚Äôs 4 year old, she was very very upset, and refused to put one on. Children are not used to having to wear masks outdoors. Luckily they allowed us to stay as long as we promised to distance from the animals, but we were pretty worried we were going to be kicked out having seen almost none of the zoo‚Äîand tickets are NOT CHEAP. You even have to pay for 2 year olds. It goes without saying we didn‚Äôt do the petting zoo.
So bottom line-great zoo, but don‚Äôt go if you think your child will refuse to wear a mask.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMUlXOGt3RRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Austin+Zoo/@30.4786865,-105.8819976,6z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x865b486a700c8603:0x462555d2f98457e3!8m2!3d30.2608711!4d-97.9377719!16s%2Fm%2F02r69pd?hl=en",ChIJA4YMcGpIW4YR41eE-dJVJUY,Zoo,3.0,Austin Zoo,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlhvZMW2YhH-oz9EY2r4rPY-NM-CCGgDPjkjzN=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"Came here for my friends kids birthday and it was super fabulous! I enjoy going to the zoo, this is a different type of zoo than most people are used too. The zoo is smaller than most, but it's also more laid back and casual to me. It is more of a re-homing facility for animals who have a long back story. They are definitely doing good work here! All the animals seem to be enjoying their time and they are getting love. I think it is much different than a standard zoo but it's also different in a good way. It is a non-profit and to me I think they are doing very good things for the animals and educating the children in our area. I noticed it might be difficult to get around for those who have strollers and or wheel chairs, they gravel is a little tough and there are some dips and holes, but I don't mind watching where I walk. I feel like they are spending the money on the right things. I think it's a great place to take children! The birthday party pavilion was great! It was very cool in there and plenty of space. The staff was super friendly and helpful! If I had kids I'd bring them back here often, I'd probably even take guests who are animal lovers here to visit as well!

Edelweiss is located in German Park at the end of the drive.  The park itself isn't anything major, but the scenery is very nice.
Once at the parking lot, you can go in the main entrance and down the stairs to the restaurant or follow the sidewalk north of the building where it slopes down and around the building to their outdoor seating. You can see a gnome garden along the way!
I've seen comments saying this place isn't handicap accessible, but this sidewalk is the entrance to take if you have a wheelchair or stroller.  Understandably, this will be inconvenient if it is raining.
The outdoor seating is the beer garden area and the doors lead into the restaurant.

On Wednesdays there is a buffet.  I'm writing this review after a stop at their buffet and I'm impressed.
On Fridays they have live music; simply amazing fun!

They have several events through the year and I definitely recommend checking them out! Fr√ºhlingsfest, J√§gerfest, Octoberfest and more!

"The food here was absolutely terrific! Some places offer homestyle dishes like your mom used to make. This place offers homestyle dishes like someone else's mom made, and they're all delicious. My favorite was the shepherds pie, but everything they served was great. Wednesday nights are ""buffeteria"" style. They serve you like a cafeteria but you keep going back until you're finished. Non-members price was $16.95 which I felt was fair for the quality of food and service provided. If you want to try something a little out of the ordinary I highly recommend a Edelweiss!

"This place is amazing.  Talk about taking yourself back in time for a minute you feel like you are in Germany.  They open at 5pm for dinner only.  You drive down this  dark road, and you would never know there was a parking lot and a restaurant from the top of the road.
You go inside from the parking lot on a top level,  down a flight of  stairs is the restaurant.  They do have an elevator for handicap.
Once below it's amazing.  It's small probably about 30 tables, wooden walls, and all decorated with Germany memorabilia.
I was so excited to try this place the last time I had German food was in Germany 20 plus years ago.  I still remember what that tasted like.
There was 2 waitress serving and taking orders. Lisa was our waitress.  She is such a nice lady,  and definitely knows her menu,  and has worked their for a long time.  I ordered the German beer on tap it was very light, clear, and refreshing. My other half Bayrischer Schweinebraten it was a tender slow roasted pork shoulder.  I tasted the dish and it was amazing.  Very tender and with lots of flavor.  It was not sliced it was more like chunk pork. His side was the sliced apples.  I have never tried apples sliced fresh, in a cinnamon sauce.  I wish you could order this by the pint or quart to take home.  Amazing!
I ordered J√§gerschnitzel which was delicious with the cream white wine sauce, and mushroom.  The sauce was so good I asked for a little more sauce. The pork meat was tender, and a nice slice. My sides was potato pancakes oh my goodness hold the fork these were not greasy at all.  I put the sour cream and applesauce on the potato cakes. My other side I was wanting to try was the German potato salad.  It was good, completely traditional,  but not my favorite for my taste buds. Before dinner you have a choice of soup or salad.  I definitely tried the soup which was really good the traditional red cabbage soup.
I can't wait to come back to try more dishes.
For dessert if you have room definitely order the bread pudding with the warm whiskey sauce.  You will want to make room for this dessert.
We were getting ready to leave, they were closing, and they were so nice they make everything fresh daily, and had extra apple and cherry turnovers. I had taken home 1 of each. The next day with a cup of coffee, warmed up,  very good.
I can't wait to come back!

"Fantastic interior layout, private dining area from the bar. My brother and I came here for dinner he was in town and I haven't been here yet so we decided to try it. Food was interesting to say the least, we got the CALABRIAN CHILI CUCUMBERS for an app and it was more tangy like pickled cucumbers. Still very refreshing. I got the SWEET CORN AGNOLOTTI  , charred corn very sweet with shredded crab mix, pretty good however needed a little salt added.
My brother got BRAISED PORK BELLY, cooked an amazin crispy skin , however, this one was overly salted. Not bad but our palette was interesting.
Then we ended with dessert CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE and Seasonal Truffles (3)
By far my favorite I've tried, subtle , flavor isn't overpowering (I don't have that much of a sweet tooth) would definitely get the dessert again! The truffles was alright, dark chocolate and white chocolate. Tasted really nice.

"I want to begin by saying I really love the atmosphere. The tables are spaced out enough that there is not much noise and it‚Äôs easy to talk to your table. The interior decoration is also very beautiful. There is not much parking but I live close so I walked. The food was delicious but there were just enough weird things that made me give 4 instead of 5 stars. The bread and butter (which is its own appetizer) is OK but definitely not anything to write home about, the butter pat was cold so not easily spreadable. I ordered the cauliflower main dish with sauce and golden raisins knowing it would be lighter than a meat main. However, with the price of the dish, I was expecting a bit more than 1/4 of a cauliflower head for my main meal. I know inflation and prices are high but cauliflower? Seems they could‚Äôve spared a bit more. Additionally the olive oil cake with rhubarb and strawberry ice cream was good but the ice cream stole the show! The cake itself was just ok and the rhubarb had not been sweetened enough to make it palatable, I ended up taking it off. The service was good but not great, we had a new server and she made a few missteps that ultimately would have cost our party money if we hadn‚Äôt spoken up (as opposed to slow service, etc). Overall, I definitely want to go back to the elm, i will just choose my dishes more carefully.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX1AyLVd3EAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Elm+Restaurant/@39.1611609,-86.7899909,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x886c6708d507ad07:0x637ac7c0df7ee644!8m2!3d39.1611609!4d-86.526319!16s%2Fg%2F11pctwtx_4?hl=en",ChIJB60H1QhnbIgRROZ-38DHemM,Restaurant,4.0,The Elm Restaurant,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoW89ePePoKhRoJQIukaMmy8uanpBy-oEo6kr-=w150-h150-k-no-p,restaurant
"The Elm is beautiful, gorgeous even, and the staff were friendly, attentive and good at their jobs. The menu is big enough that there are enough choices but it's not overwhelming. The cocktail menu is inventive.
I mention all of this because the bar, from the moment you walk in the door, is set very very high. And the food is great. It's just not quite as beautiful as the decor or as perfect as the menu describes.
The tostones are plentiful and the brussel sprouts are crispy. But the sauces leave something to be desired.
The steak and lamb were excellently cooked but greens and asparagus needed a little more flavor.

"Update 2/14/23

Walking up to the main entrance of the casino was worse than before.  Cigarettes are all over,  things need painted and everything could do well with a good powerwashing.  Nothing about this 1st glance gives me ""destination resort"" vibes.    We arrived around 8:30 in the morning so it was obvious this littered mess was not fresh.  If this place wants to pull in new customers and become a major moneymaker,  things need to change.  When your facility is much less clean than the local gas stations,  you have an issue.   Granted,  the inside is clean,  but the outside is what sets the tone.  Do better, Mardi Gras!

Original review:  We have stayed here numerous times through the years.  This last visit was already a letdown due to no pool and none of the amazing breakfast foods.  The room was not the cleanest and the gold fixtures are now chrome and gold due to someone using the incorrect cleaner.  All of the restaurants in the casino were closed and there was no room service.

My suggestions to help would be:

Breakfast:  Since the old buffet style won't work,  the easiest way to serve the delicious hot breakfast would be for each room to put an order in either online or by calling concierge.  Their items would be prepared and could be dropped off contactless outside of the room or could be picked up in the lobby.

Cleaning:  Supervisor checking rooms to make sure they are bring cleaned properly.  They should also be sure to teach proper use of cleaning agents and which products to use on each surface.

Restaurants:  If none of the on site eateries are going to be open,  either offer meals via room service again or at least put together a listing of nearby restaurants and contact information.   Maybe even see if any would be willing to give hotel guests a discount.

I know some of these items seem small but if you want to call yourself a resort and be a destination vacation spot,  you can't overlook the little things.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4XzVhMW53RRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mardi+Gras+Casino+%26+Resort/@35.8076728,-90.2479862,6z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x8848cba4893b5411:0xe687c321e466648c?hl=en",ChIJEVQ7iaTLSIgRjGRm5CHDh-Y,Casino,3.0,Mardi Gras Casino & Resort,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpkP9vjfIILbqbjx2bLJ7WguDPkiF83qC8iUM1=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

About half of the holes have an elevated gain at the green or tee box.  It might be a ride for some. If the walk from the first tee box or the walk to the 9th green look steep to you.

"Challenging holes are carved out of the hillside along the river at this course to provide something for everyone. First and foremost there is more vertical change at this course than many I have played in the past. Some pin locations are a hundred feet above the tee box while others are the same downhill. This makes it almost a must to rent a cart if you are playing 18, unless you are in peak physical condition.

The clubhouse is big and clean with friendly staff members to help out with your needs. The range is quite short and narrow, only 200 yards max by about 20 yards wide which makes it hard to warm up for the long shots you will need to be successfull right off the first tee. The carts are older and gas powered which made it tricky to get up some if the steep hills and there is some slow play if you are behind the wrong group.

Insider tip: make sure to study the course before you go if you haven't played here. There are hidden creeks and obstacles that ruin great shots down the middle.

Nestled in the foothills of Forest Park (one of the nation's largest urban pakrs) the gorgeous setting allows unparalleled views. If you find yourself frustrated about your golf game, you can take a moment to see beautiful glimpses Mt. Hood, Mt. St. Helens, and countless other bounties of nature.

Oh yes of course- golf! The course itself is well-maintained, and has its own unique blend of challenges and opportunities. Navigating through a ""normal"" course is challenged in its own rite, but couple that with nestling into the side of a mountain and you have Wildwood!

"Just played here on Sunday 10/6, about three weeks post-punching. The greens are fantastic. They're rolling very smooth and true..and at a great speed. They're firm, yet they're holding shots the way they should. Also, the traps were all hand raked, and fairways were very playable.

Look for a new expanded green complex and new lower tee on the par three # 6, and new tee locations on # 7. One thing that always impresses me about Wildwood, is the attention to detail, and the constant reinvestment in the course and clubhouse.

Also, the service is always friendly and accommodating. If you've never played Wildwood, be sure to give it a try. It's a real hidden gem of a golf course, with plenty of interesting holes, lots of character and challenges, and spectacular views.

Companion enjoyed the pool (could be cooler) and hot tub (could be warmer). Good equipment options in workout room. Breakfast options included blueberry or malt mini-waffles, cheese omelets, bacon, biscuits, gravy, fruit, cereal, breads and pastries, yogurt.

"Reserved our deluxe king room with jetted tub for Sept 19th back in mid June 2021 & requested a quiet location (if possible). They put us in room 314, which was located on 3rd of 4 floors, right outside of the elevators & across from the ice machine room (very noisy).

The bath towels were thin, rough, and worn (one had two rips on edges... see pics). Jetted tub was the best part of the room, but took forever to fill up. But, for some stupid reason there was NO vent fan in the bathroom! Horrible!

The furnishings were a bit dated & I wouldn't call the size of the king room a ""deluxe"". Reserved that room purely because I knew after a 12 hr drive I'd want to soak in a nice big bath tub. Mattress was comfy, but only 3 squishy pillows (not 4) on the king sized bed (no neck support at all).

I am appalled at the quality of service and food at this place. While a family of Mexicans sitting next to us got served like royalty we were put on the back burner the waitress came over a total of three times while we were there. She also loved to flirt with her boss the whole time while ignoring us! We ran out of chips and salsa asked for more and didn't get any until after we got our food. When I got my plate. The portion was so small ! I had maybe 10 tiny pieces of meat and 4 pieces of shrimp on my dish which was the muscle maker . The lettuce was all brown and nasty. The avocado looked rotten. And not just a normal oxidation brown but it looked like it had been sitting and got rotten and they didn't care. Also only got like three slices of avocado. The dish looked nothing like the picture on the menu. I would have sent it back immediately but the waitress ran off and never even came back until it was to bring  the check.

"This was my first time at Tropicana Atlantic City. I stayed in the Havana Tower with 1  King size bed.
My first impression--the place is a sprawling monster of a Hotel and Casino resort. From the hotels lobby and check-in located on the lowest level (below the main casino floor accessible by escalators) to my room was a good 10 minute walk. If you have a lot of luggage it's going to be a workout for you. If you can't walk long distances or have any issues getting around, I suggest getting a room closer to the lobby and casino floor. The walk to my room involved many long inclined hallways, a pass through the shops and restaurants in the Quarter  and finally to the Havana Tower.
My room was big and looked very inviting and clean. But upon further inspection, it had it's share of problems. Smudges and  crud and on multiple door jams, and the bathroom vent and the room In-take A/C vent were disgustingly dirty. It looked unhealthy. (See pics)  Not sure if it is mold or just thick black dust but it should be cleaned REGULARLY. Besides that, I wanted to simply relax and take a shower but there was no body wash or hand soap for the sink. I called house keeping and was told they would be sending some up to the room immediately. I waited for over an hour and nothing showed up from housekeeping. Had to call again.  Someone showed up 30 minutes after that. (My stay was on a Wednesday and it took that long to get something that they forgot to put in the room. I can't imagine how long I request, like body wash or simply extra towels, would take on a weekend.
The hotel immenities are a pool and a very impressive  entertainment, shopping and restaurant area called the Quarter. It boasts over 24 restaurants, 25 shops of various goods and 22 bars and clubs and other entertainment like an Escape room.
Overall, despite the bad cleaning and service delays   from the housekeeping department,   I would recommend this hotel.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dDR6Wk9BEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tropicana+Atlantic+City/@37.5346621,-86.6444706,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89c0ee64503d341f:0x5ae59bb688f27ccb!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.3523692!4d-74.4445618!16zL20vMDVnNXJt?hl=en",ChIJHzQ9UGTuwIkRy3zyiLab5Vo,Hotel,4.0,Tropicana Atlantic City,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCIvOMm7ONTLCiydZBDGL4zD5nxUpWdu7YCWL5=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"We have been staying at the Tropicana In Atlantic City for over 20 years.  This will be our last stay at the property.  From check in to check out we have never been treated so poorly. The resort is in bad shape. It isn‚Äôt ADA compliant as handrails are missing in the elevators and everything was dirty, as seen in the photos we posted.  At check in we were assigned a room that wasn‚Äôt clean.  There were potato chips all over the floor and the sheets were stained and gross with shoe prints all over the sheets.  We were assigned a new room, but it wasn‚Äôt much better.  There were boogers and blood wiped on the walls, the curtains had holes and the paint was peeling off the walls and headboards.  We had three guests and two towels.  When we requested more towels, housekeeping said we were only allowed two per room.  Two towels for three guests?  Housekeeping never came to our room to empty the trash or make the beds or collect old towels.  The next day we had to call housekeeping to get towels. I called back two hours later, and the gentlemen told me ‚ÄúYeah, I have your slip right here‚Äù and then hung up on me.  The towels never came.  The only time housekeeping came to our room was to rush us to checkout.  By the third day the toilet stopped flushing properly and we had to use the casino restrooms. The hallway during our stay was disgusting and dirty.  The manager on duty couldn‚Äôt be reached.

"EDIT
9/6 - Responded to owners request to email hotel about experience. I have emailed and hope the hotel will rectify this horrible experience. Will update when they have responded.

9/6 Where do I begin, first do not stay here!!!!!! There is no service and it ruined a birthday weekend trip.

When we arrived in AC we were going to check-in early. Mind you getting to the lobby hotel is a maze in itself with no signage anywhere to tell you where to go. We get to the lobby and there's 20 people and two receptionists along with self check-in machines on the side. I decided to wait. We waited to find out that there was a $25 fee to do so. We thought okay whatever let's do it and we asked if the room we reserved was ready and she said no housekeeping didn't get to it and you'll have to wait until 3pm. So we decided to wait for our room and came back at 3pm. We got our room  and it was not ready. Stains on the pillow cases and sheets and the bathroom with visible hairs everywhere. We called housekeeping 4x and each time they emphasized that requests take up to an hour to be completed. I said weird huh because I've been calling since 3pm and it's 7pm and nothing has been done. So I decided to call expedia for a refund. Expedia gets a manager called Jamal to help us and he says there is the same room ready and clean. So we trusts him and make the change just to find out the room is in the back of the hotel and even dirtier than the first. I had to go back downstairs and request our original room with the view and I would go to the store and buy cleaning supplies myself. The front desk manager was extremely helpful and so nice and helped fixed the situation. I have the emphasized SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE HELPFUL!. And when we moved back to the room it was finally being serviced and cleaned. However, it did take them until 8:30pm to have this completed. They did service the room the next day but at this point the trip was ruined and we checked out.

Save yourself the hassle and go elsewhere.  There's no entertainment, the casino here was dead, and the atmosphere just scummy. We ended up spending most of the following day at the ocean hotel and wished we would have just booked there.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleE9maWtnRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tropicana+Atlantic+City/@37.5346621,-86.6444706,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89c0ee64503d341f:0x5ae59bb688f27ccb!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.3523692!4d-74.4445618!16zL20vMDVnNXJt?hl=en",ChIJHzQ9UGTuwIkRy3zyiLab5Vo,Hotel,1.0,Tropicana Atlantic City,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuWlztpZVEcueAWl4UIaQ06e8haKPVR3vNy2r1=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"First off I've stayed at the Tropicana before but in the Chelsea tower. I had a great experience the last time I was here. This time I stayed in the west tower and I felt like I was sleeping in a motel. First off,it took three tries to get into the room. Then I noticed the security lock on the door was the old fashioned slide lock. Then there was mold and rust on the ceiling and wall of the bathroom. The room needed a serious facelift. There was torn wallpaper, holes in the dresser where the previous tv was and the climate control was ancient.
Granted I could have asked for a new room but I was tired and didn't want to move. I did complain and they gave me a $50 food voucher and extended checkout.

"I just want to make sure, that my review will be about the hotel, not casino. Casino is actually nice and big, so you will have a lot of fun there. Let me start with the reason why we stood in Trop. It was our anniversary and we wanted to go to see our favorite DJ in Harrah‚Äôs. We are reward members, so we get comp rooms in both of these hotels plus Caesars, unfortunate all the rooms were sold out a months before our stay, so we decided to stay in Tropicana for our first time. We didn‚Äôt know, that the tower, that we picked was not renovated. We paid almost $400 for one night stay and we got old room with dirty chairs, broken safe and alarm clock, broken light in the bathroom and dirt all over. You can see it on the pictures. We called to the reward center and lady just forgot about us on the phone, so we went downstairs to see what was our options. We were ready to pay extra just to move to the nicer room. Lady in the reception helped us, she moved us to a suite in the same tower with no additional charge, but despite everything a new room wasn‚Äôt better than the previous one. Suite also was old, couches with stains, broken things all over, but we were happy about working safe and comfy beds. So my biggest advice, check the towers before stay, if you are not sure, call them and ask. Or better stay in Harrahs or Caesars for chipper and with renovated rooms.  2 stars for trying to resolve our issue and a good custom service.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaVByTlN3EAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tropicana+Atlantic+City/@37.5346621,-86.6444706,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89c0ee64503d341f:0x5ae59bb688f27ccb!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.3523692!4d-74.4445618!16zL20vMDVnNXJt?hl=en",ChIJHzQ9UGTuwIkRy3zyiLab5Vo,Hotel,2.0,Tropicana Atlantic City,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMilevuxXE4c6C0xCVfmhbUABul1OmbXtdgcy1h=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel
"Our trip was booked several weeks prior to our arrival. The self check in booths were declining many booked hotel guests, stating our rooms weren‚Äôt ready and they‚Äôd emhoyelus when it was. It was alr 6pm, and the kiosks weren‚Äôt accurate! The lines after the mass confusion and frustration began and lasted beyond an hour and some for others, with less than minimal staff at the desk to accommodate the error. This is unacceptable.
Mind you, we are here with my step daughter for a cheer competition, so there are many parents and elementary aged and younger children filling this lobby waiting for resolution.
After we‚Äôre able to get checked in, we come up to our room in the west wing‚Ä¶ seriously the most ghetto room I‚Äôve ever stayed in. I would never have anticipated a casino hotel room to be in such dated/dirty/and sloppy conditions. Bathroom is filthy, tub/shower walls stained and smells like cigarette. Cigarette burn hole in bed linen, and the paint job looks like it was done by my grandchildren. The coffee maker is broken and filthy with thick calcium buildup. There isn‚Äôt a dresser to put our clothes away. Mold in the shower molding.
The pictures on your website do NOT portray an image of the trash hole we walked into last night! We‚Äôre beyond disappointed, and have never had an experience as poor as this at any casino we‚Äôve gone to before. I plan on calling the front desk this morning for some kind of resolution.
Addendum‚Ä¶ step daughter just showed us a used band aid in her bed üò£
Spoke with management yesterday, they returned our phone call after 9 hours, offered us a different room today, however, it‚Äôs after 2pm and the room just now is ready. The replacement coffee maker and clean linen by the folded lump sum came up after several phone calls after 10:30 pm last night.
Manager stated this casino sleeps whatever sum of people and it‚Äôs difficult to keep up and please everyone. Change of room without a guaranteed time and a $50 food and beverage voucher for one of their places within the casino doesn‚Äôt make this stay worth the money I‚Äôve spent at this casino!

"The Tropicana has its decent high points, but there are issues as well:

Issues:

For blackjack fans: dealer hits on soft 17s.

Service is less than good. Front desk was manned by one person for a 40 person queue. It looked like a line at an airport. Employees can be pretty bossy too.

Listed amenities are more like ""services you can purchase"" or ""sometimes available"". To the extent that you have to pay $35 or buy a $200 massage to get access to the hot tub for a day. So don't think you can go relax at it with $$$. And it's only available on certain days. I also think you have to rent a chair at the outdoor pool if you want to sit at it? The indoor pool is only available on certain days, and is by reservation.

Some games have seriously reduced payouts. Example, a side bet at blackjack has payouts nearly cut in half compared to what other casinos run the same bet at.

As others have mentioned, the hotel and casino are dated and show it. It gives the impression that things are just being kept as is. No serious upkeep since what seems like a long time ago.

Strengths:
The resturaunt selections are pretty nice, but on the pricey side. I'd recommend the Petitie Creperie in the quarter for an affordable, pleasant meal. They have a wide selection of interesting crepes and other breakfast foods.

Plus room where stayed in at room above and next door was very loud kept up all night long... Machines was tighter than Fort Knox for the weekend when they had a promotional weekend flight come in.

I decided to post because even though the streets around the Casino area are rough around the edges it's a place you should probably visit at least once and decide for yourself.

The Tropicana itself seems well managed and trying to bounce back from the pandemic.  The building is older, but my room was fine. Only a few of the restaurants are open and one inside pool.

"The Trop is usually my go to in AC because there are tons of food options and multiple bars with happy hour deals. After this visit I may be looking for a new destination. Service was absolutely terrible throughout the entire casino. Every drink ordered AR a slot machine came out wrong, then the waitresses argued with me that they brought what I ordered. Some weren't even close. I ordered a rum and coke and they brought me a beer instead. Food was delicious every place we ate, but again terrible service and only had 2 meals in 4 days that came out correct the first time.  Housekeeping was another nightmare. We called at 9am Sunday to request service. We were out all day and no one came to clean, bring fresh towels etc. We called again and the desk told us someone would be there in an hour. We came back after dinner and the garbage was not taken, towels not taken, bed not made, and a pile of new towels and soap left on the bed. The next morning Housekeeping walked in without knocking. We told her it has ok and she could clean the room but she left and never came back. Had to call the desk for toiletries and again no one came. Day three we put the do not disturb sign on and Housekeeping knocked on the door for 10 minutes until I got up and answered. They asked if we wanted service. We had also asked for extra pillows when we checked in...I just checked out on day five and still no pillows.

I was coughing and sneezing alot. My eyes were itching. So as i started to investigate the room my sheets were dirty. The walls had black drippings rolling down the entire room walls. Maybe water stains but it was yucky! I had a double bed room . The water burned my skin and is difficult to get it to the right temperture. My phone fell and upon pulling the beds  out i saw so much yuck which explains why my allergies were all over the place. The tv was dusty. Towels had burn marks and more.

"Stayed at the north tower with my boyfriend back in September. There was a horrible storm those two days so couldn‚Äôt venture around AC much but we still had a lot of fun as there is plenty of things to do in the resort.

Room/cleanliness: I‚Äôm a smoker (horrible- I know) so I appreciated there being smoking rooms and smoking areas in the casino so I didn‚Äôt need to go out in the wind & rain just to have a smoke.
The room was in a convenient location. Right above the casino and near the elevators. Our window view was overlooking the casino which was pretty cool. The furniture was a little dated and the cleaning was ehh but that‚Äôs pretty much the case with all smoking rooms in any hotel/resort.

Casino: clean. I saw several employees doing detailed cleaning while playing the slots.

Parking: If staying in the North tower, I recommend using the valet. It was very convenient and the charge for it wasn‚Äôt much.

Staff: no complaints about the Tropicana staff. All very friendly and helpful.

Location: perfect location to the boardwalk and beach. I definitely recommend The Rain Forest Cafe located on the boardwalk.

My only 2 complaints (one was my fault).
1.  was our experience at Hooters there. From the moment we walked in the door, the waitress was very rude. Maybe she was having a bad day but it seemed like she took one look at us and assumed we wouldn‚Äôt tip well (we tip a standard 20-30% (depending on service which I think is very fair). We were nothing but kind to her but she was still extremely rude. The other waitress walking around seemed delightful, I wish she was our waitress instead.
Complaint 2: we went during the week days in the fall so the pools weren‚Äôt open. That‚Äôs my bad for not seeing that in their website. So if you want to use a pool, double check the pools are open.
I think all the bad reviews were from people expecting it to be a five star hotel. Most said there wasn‚Äôt much signage for locations but if you look up, there are signs with arrows pointing where to go.

Over all, we had a great time and definitely plan to be back soon!

"I feel the biggest pro for Trop is that it is one of the best casinos for food options. Lots of different types of places like Chickie & Pete's, Palm, Carmine's, etc. The casino is decent and clean although my wife was disappointed with no Monopoly or goldfish slots (that we saw).

The room we had was pretty outdated but spacious. You can hear people next door, at least from the room we had.

We waited probably 25 mins in line Friday early evening (6:30pm) to check in. The self check-in didn't work for us so we then had to wait for a person which was another line. Expect to wait, especially on the weekend. The only major con was leaving Sunday. The parking garage was backed up all the way to the top. It was crazy. Probably close to an hour to get out.

All said, I still feel it is one of the best options in Atlantic City. It's an option for us now that it is Caesar's Rewards.

"So far, not so good. Self check-in kiosk put us in a double when we reserved a king. Currently waiting in line in the South Tower Lobby, a long walk from the Havana Tower where we were, for assistance in rectifying the situation.  We have already had to change our dinner reservation at Ossu. I will update once we are settled. Not getting better: only 1 person working the counter. People behind us have been waiting for an email that their room is ready for an hour. Wow.
8:30 and Gary is now helping us. ""The Kiosk wouldn't make a mistake. Whatever room you booked is the one you got.""
Except it's not the one we booked and, oh look, we have the confirmation.
""Well, if a king bed is important to you,I can put you in the North Tower. ""
Yes, since it is what we booked, we'd like the king.
So, we're in the king on the 17th of the North Tower. It's fine. Smells vaguely of cigarettes and marijuana, but it's  AC so... We may make our new reservation at 9.
I'll update tomorrow,  but at this point, my advice is avoid this property.

Good morning. Final update: The bed is pretty soft, but would be fine if there was any substance to the pillows, or if there were more pillows (4 small ""feather"" pillows on a king bed with no extras in the closet).
The temperature was impossible to regulate to any satisfaction. See the picture of the 70's technology thermostat.
The shower looked beautiful, however the design is awkward and it functions poorly.

"For entertainment and dining this place is great, but do NOT stay in the West tower unless you're trying to save a few bucks.

Entertainment: Casino is vast, table games are plenty (enough) and the sportsbook is big.

Check in: they have many electronic kiosks, but they seemed clunky. Many people were having issues that required help, including us. They'll help did come quickly.

Rooms: We suggest not staying in West. Beds were okay. Bathroom is big. But the walls were scuffed/marked like a children's playroom. There is no carpeting, just vinyl floor which makes it a bit cold, (and more importantly louder above you.) If you do get a West tower room, request as far from the elevators as possible (you want the last two digits of your room number to be as high as possible, definitely above 25).

If you love 80s bathroom fixtures, and showers that whistle like tea kettles, then you'll love West. Haha.

Do not even think of trying to get an elevator near checkout time. After waiting five minutes, we took the stairs from the 45th floor and there were so many taking the stairs you'd think it was an evacuation.

Not a horrible room, and it was a few bucks cheaper, but had we'd known, we definitely would've paid more to be anywhere except West.

Parking: Extremely reasonable at only $10 for Saturday and Sunday night, and our check-in gave us a $5 voucher. So $5 total for 2 days of parking? Fabulous.

"Be aware that unless you book directly through the Tropicana hotel (website), you're more likely working with a booking agency (not directly affiliated with the Tropicana Hotel) and you won't  know the total cost of the room until you check in at the hotel.

Your room is subject to taxes and fees (TOURISM FEE/TAX 2; CASINO FEE/TAX 2; A.C. OCC SURCHARGE/TAX 2; RESORT FEE/TAX 2) that booking agents don't disclose when you make and pay for your reservation (a least ours didn't).

These additional fees and taxes increased the cost of the 2-night stay from $92.70 to $184.01.

While the final cost may not be outrageous, it is certainly (at twice the listed nightly rate) more than you expected when you booked the room.

In addition to that, our booking agent charged only $50 (of the total cost of our stay) to my credit card at the time of booking, leaving the remaining balance to be paid at check-in. And the reservation was not confirmed for the section of the hotel whee we prefer to stay.

Our room was cold both nights but after a 'jump start', it started to warm up a bit (recycling regularly on it's own for the 1st time since we arrived). Annoying, yes. But not worth relocating or having to wait for someone from maintenance to show up and address the problem. The room was clean, good sized, uncarpeted, poorly lit (and heated) with just a desk, one lonely desk chair, a safe and mini fridge (that whined) and no microwave.

Spacious bathroom with pull bars in the tub/shower but only one hook to hang things on (towels, PJ's, wash cloths or anything else).

Parking is NOT FREE, but it's reasonable.

As long as you know what to expect when you book, you can relax and enjoy the place. It would be nice, I think, if Jersey lawmakers would require these booking agencies to disclose their status and all of the additional costs when they take your call.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtb3FyeHF3RRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tropicana+Atlantic+City/@37.5346621,-86.6444706,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89c0ee64503d341f:0x5ae59bb688f27ccb!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.3523692!4d-74.4445618!16zL20vMDVnNXJt?hl=en",ChIJHzQ9UGTuwIkRy3zyiLab5Vo,Hotel,3.0,Tropicana Atlantic City,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpDochY69AEPJ3UHBP36bY9fiYebdiTXipNKZi=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"Pros: The hotel itself is great. Kiosk‚Äôs located throughout the hotel allow the guests to check out really easily. Great food and entertainment options. Valet is $35 and you get your car back in under 10 minutes. Fireworks at night. Great casino.

Cons: Check in desk had 2 staff members for a line of 15+ groups needing to check in. Kiosks would redirect you to the check in desk. From waiting in line to finally getting my room keys was about 45 minutes. Not all the rooms have a nice view but it‚Äôs give in take: view of a parking garage but located next to a lot of dining/shopping options. The room was fairly dirty. During COVID it would be nice to have a little extra cleaning. Especially with the $35 a night ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù that is charged. Trash left from the prior guest, stains on the sheets, hair in the drain, oily hair dryer, stains on the wall, and dusty room should not be an acceptable condition.

I absolutely agree with other reviews that the road noise is significant and that site #14 is only appropriate for a smaller RV.  We were able to back into #14 with a 20' trailer, I cannot imagine doing it with anything larger. It seemed that several of the concrete pads were not level, we noticed an RV with both of its front tires off the ground after being leveled. We enjoyed kayaking but found strong and irregular currents in front of the PUD building. We didn't notice any real beach, but maybe the tides were off while we were there.

"The husband and I have decided to set off and try a new place where we have never ate before every Friday for date night, with that being said we found ourselves here. My first impression wasn't bad at first. It was very beautiful when we walked in. A little confusing because you choose if you'd like to eat in the Diner or Pub and each menu was a tad different (as they did show us) but I was still confused so I just said Diner so we could get to eating. After about a 20 minute wait we was finally placed into a corner but at this point I didn't care, I was just ready to eat. We ordered our drinks and appetizers, those took about 15 minutes to receive. I immediately noticed that the glass was dirty, still at this point I'm trying to stay positive. I calmly wait as we wait for our waiter to come back so I can express my concerns to him unfortunately he took about 20 minutes before he came back in that 20 minutes we watched others get drinks numerous times and their food as we still set there waiting to just get one more drink, at this point I'm getting annoyed. Right about then a manager walk by and I expressed my concerns to her and she immediately address the issue. We finally receive our food from our original waiter and to be honest the burger was okay it didn't have much flavor at all but at this point I'm still trying to stay positive and look at the positive like at least the fries are good right? Just overall not a good experience I don't think I would ever go back there again the manager however did come up to us and offer us a free dessert to take home and we kindly took it home with us to enjoy later.

Not for me but others really enjoy this restaurant. To me the food is only okay compared to the high price. My parents however come here for the nostalgia and environment. My mom had the pecan crusted chicken which she said was ‚Äúone of the best meals‚Äù she ever had. My father and I had the brisket sandwich which was good. The cheese is definitely the best part of this place however my one complaint is that it come out in plastic salad dressing containers.

"This review is for Winston‚Äôs pub.

Writing a review is a pain in the toto. I avoid it as much as possible. But this place deserves it.

There is a reason why this place is still #1:

- The bar section is nice a quiet.
- Their alcohol selections are thoughtful. There are 2 non-alcoholic beers. There is a local Michigan vodka, etc.
- I asked the server about a strange looking bottle and she got me a sample. How sweet.
- The food options are incredible.

"Visited from out of town and spent family time at the Dakota Zoo.

I'm used to bigger zoos that are very crowded and the animals are 20 feet away.  I was expecting to see animals I see at my home zoo; I was wrong.  The variety and habitats of the animals is fun and interesting.

The zoo was not crowded.  My family could wander around at their own pace.  The zoo is very well covered by trees which provide shade in many places.  The paths are a bit run down, but fine for wheelchairs and strollers.  We did not have a map of the zoo which made it confusing to me.  My daughter knew her way around and there are info signs periodically to show the exhibit locations.

I did not see many food stands that I'm used to in bigger zoos.  I think everything is near the entrance.  There is a petting zoo at the entrance as well.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcDktUGJBEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dakota+Zoo/@46.7994838,-105.4210117,7z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x52d783615180c12b:0x17765924d9bf0c36!8m2!3d46.7994838!4d-100.8067539!16zL20vMDgzX3lf?hl=en",ChIJK8GAUWGD11IRNgy_2SRZdhc,Zoo,5.0,Dakota Zoo,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP86oVUij85uRqHq_HnSWxDtrd97BgFY-w6jMnb=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"For a view of Mount Shasta, this place was one of the best in town. It was centrally located, within walking distance to most of the restaurants in town. The rooms itself could use some freshening up, not really outdated, just looked a little tired. Couldn't tell if the refrigerator in the room was working, didn't seem to get particularly cold and there was no adjustment. The restaurant was good but do yourself a favor and DO NOT PURCHASE THE PRE PAID BREAKFAST PACKAGE. They charge you $20 per person for breakfast. You get your choice of one entree and one drink. My wife ordered the Granola and coffee and wanted a bagel. She was told that she would have to pay extra for the bagel even though the total with the bagel wasn't over $20. You're better off paying as you go because you don't get the difference if your total is under $20. Staff was friendly and helpful. Overall, our stay was ok, I'd stay here again if I were in town but I wouldn't pre pay for breakfast again.

Just got a response from Best Western. They state that their breakfast package are $10 for adults and $5 for children. Going through Bookings.com we were charged $20 per person. Our total for breakfast for the 5 days we were there was $200. I will say breakfast was good but not $200 good.

"Fantastic location for a short trip around Mt. Shasta.

Our first ever stay here. There are cheaper lodges too in the area but our risk appetite was limited, hence went for this one with higher security and better arrangement in terms of breakfast and room quality.

I just wish they could have provided housekeeping service too since we spent more than just one night. I remember how during pre-covid times the hotel rooms in any place used to be cleaned and well arranged each day by the time you were back. Miss that luxury!

Breakfast isn't a buffet. That also surprised me. They have a standard list of 6-7 entres and you have to choose your breakfast from it. Us being vegetarians had limited options and repeated the same thing the next day. It was, however, delicious. Lovvvedd the hot chocolate with whipped cream.

If there had been fruits, bread, juices, muffins and things like that as a buffet I could have adjusted the quantity and variety.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMUpHWHBnRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Best+Western+Plus+Tree+House/@38.1399101,-128.4934264,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x54cde6d99d0d5d33:0x208cb78b1a23300e!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d41.309654!4d-122.317721!16s%2Fg%2F1wc30zmg?hl=en",ChIJM10NndnmzVQRDjAjGou3jCA,Hotel,4.0,Best Western Plus Tree House,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMY7695T9hz-BUzJ09xsow-C4R2CVkvuMStFR5F=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"Nice grounds an a clean room and bathroom but that's about it.  The shower in the morning was only like warm... very disappointing. The bed was old and brokendown or just incredibly soft and very uncomfortable with small very LUMPY pillows. Worst night of sleep on the trip.
The restaurant is a bit old and the furniture is pretty broken down. I sunk into my seat about 3 inches! The food was pretty disappointing too...medium steak (at over $30!) Came out cold and raw. Could not send it back because the ONE server was completely overwhelmed with tables. That said...her service and attitude considering the situation was incredible! She really tried very hard to get to everyone.
It's probably a great place to being kids...nice outdoor courtyards between the buildings and little waterfalls.  There is an indoor pool that looked pretty decent.

Conveniently located with only about a 20 minute drive to Mt Shasta Ski Park. They DO NOT have the traditional free breakfast, however they do have a restaurant onsite. Also have a bar and grill. Food is a little spend but good, as expected for hotel restaurants. They were short staffed but the waitresses did their best and were very polite and accommodating. We decided to stay an extra night on a holiday weekend and while booked, the manager Joe pulled through for us and got us an extension. All of the staff work hard and are very polite.

"Pros:
LOVE LOVE the Best Western Tree House! Will stay again!

Loved the cabin-esque feel with the high ceilings.

It was great that you could get to the lobby and restaurant all internally.

Great views of the snow capped mountains from our window.

Great prices at the restaurant but there weren't menus readily available. Nice diner to sit down to eat.

Close enough to popular attractions like Burney Falls and McCloud Falls.

Rooms with external door and kitchenette options available.

Felt safe here.

Ryan was great at check in.

Cons:
Pricey but better than all the other hotels around.

Heating/Cooling system didn't work very well.

Pool and hot tub closed due to Covid.

We came for 4th of July weekend and our friends booked our Airbnb here at Las Palmas I love the resort entirely! First time in Puero Penasco! So walking from the Condo to the beach was just a few mins so close by the beach. Our view was amazing & breathtaking! The resort pools we absolutely loved and enjoyed. They have the kid family pool area which is impressive cause they have really cool slides and shallow area for littles. Plus offer his eats and antojitos while swimming and lounging. The resort has zero tolerance for partying too late and loud obnoxious ppl will be addressed or kicked out so I like that too.

"This was a great condo & beach facilities. We went on the jet ski, had pi√±a coladas, swam in the pool, cooked breakfast in the room and slept comfortably in the bed. There were four of us on a very roomy 2 bedroom with beautiful views on the 9th floor. We didn‚Äôt get to use other amenities as we were only there for 24 hours but we will venture back. Please keep in mind the border in that area closes at 8pm SHARP from the Arizona side so get there with plenty of time for a line up. Also ‚Äî watch out for sand storms in the area, we encountered one and it was a doozy that would have been very uncomfortable if we weren‚Äôt already in the taxi!

"We always have a blast here and recommended this place. But our last outing here a women jumped a curb and went into the spectators fence.  The women was very rude about how it was handled.

"This is arguably the best sushi in Easton (maybe even the shore)! I've tried all the others and I keep coming back. The staff is friendly and always asks about my family when I come in alone. The wait for food is never long, even if the place is full. You can dine in at lunch and get back to work quick. The menu items consistently taste amazing and are prepared the same way everytime... there are no surprises, if you order an Olympic roll it's going to be amazing Every Single Time, and that surely can not be said for the other places in town. Some of my favorites are ""Amazing Tuna"" ""Jingle Bell"" ""Olympic"" ""Incredible"" and ""spicey crab"" but all of them are good. If you go between 12 and 4 the special is ""get 1 special roll and get a second at half off"". Oh, and their unsweetened tea is the best in town, I know that's a small thing but it matters to me since I've given up soda.

"If you are looking to stay at a top-notch hotel. The Best Western Premier Bridgewood (Neenah) is an excellent choice. Our family of 4 stayed here recently while on our family vacation and stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which is a must for us with two teenagers. Each of the kids had their own bed in their own room, we had a separate room with a king bed and there was also a spacious family room. Three 65 inch tvs in each space kept everyone entertained during our downtime. The room was clean, nice and spacious. The hotel itself was very clean and nice in all areas. The pool is nicer than average hotel pools featuring a shallow wading pool for small children and main pool with basketball hoop and a larger slide for older kids. Two hot tubs one indoors and one outside were nice and relaxing. On site restaurant was very good and convenient to get to within the hotel. After our stay we received an emailed survey and personal response letter from the hotel manager thanking us.

"NOT WORTH THE COST!!!
Save your money, and use the $25 for something that is more than 10 mins long. Also for $75 we could have   had hours worth of fun some where else in the city rather than 10 mins.

Is it a fun experience for children ages 3 to 12, yes! If money is NOT a worry for you then go and enjoy yourself. Our child had a great time for the 15 mins. However, $25 for adults and children is absolutely ridiculous. At BEST this is should cost $12 for adults $5 for children.

The only reason they can get away with charging such an absurd price is because it is in Faneuil Hall.

"Please note: NO WHEELCHAIR or STROLLER access on the day of our visit. There is one small elevator serving all of Quincy Market and if it‚Äôs inop - you cannot access the Dino Safari since it‚Äôs located up a huge flight of stairs. They suggested we carry the stroller upstairs. Not possible due to weight of stroller & 19-month old ‚Äî but also not safe for child. The folks at Dino Safari said they‚Äôve ‚Äúbeen asking‚Äù them to fix the elevator for some time.

"Main takeaways: not worth the price, but the kids did have fun. The exhibit was small, very warm (no ac even in Summer), and the main thing is that the dinosaurs appear to be inflatable? And in very poor condition (missing teeth, hair and feathers missing in large patches, sections of the inflatable not working etc.) the lighting is also very low and odd. It seems designed to be scary and colorful maybe, instead of actually being able to see any detailing on the creatures. I paid $25 per person (including the kids) and you can see the exhibit in 15-20 minutes (reading all of the educational material). It just isn‚Äôt worth it.

The only reason this isn‚Äôt a 1 star or a complaint to the organization for a refund, is that the kids did have fun. The dinosaurs are touchable (probably why they are in such terrible condition). And there is an interactive coloring program at the end that is pretty good (but even that was glitchy.)",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa2NqSDJRRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dino+Safari+Boston:+A+Walk-Thru+Adventure/@42.9161377,-71.8822557,9z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e371a4e43be949:0xf28f02a7abf984e2!8m2!3d42.3597994!4d-71.0545357!16s%2Fg%2F11p676q92g?hl=en",ChIJSek75KRx44kR4oT5q6cCj_I,Exhibit,2.0,Dino Safari Boston: A Walk-Thru Adventure,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMujw1pvPz8j8jaU-OkcvqrIkqfnwxDMa6mHDxN=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"At best, I'm a novice at the aquarium hobby. I've been setting up an aquarium and navigating all the intricacies that comes with setting up a new aquarium. In doing so, a social media aquarium hobby group recommended the Austin Aqua Dome as a solid, local hub for hobbyists. During my visit, I was greeted and invited to ask any questions I might have.

The building calls back to the ""Keep Austin Weird"" idea in both supporting a local business *and* being a wonderfully unique shopping experience in offering an infinite collection of aquarium related materiel to purchase- from fresh water to salt/marine, from ponds, to desktop bowls and extravagant custom aquariums. My overall experience was akin to me being a kid going on a great field trip like a previous visitor mentioned in their review.

Though I am still waiting to introduce fish to my aquarium, I was able to have questions answered about different live plants suitable to my experience and want for the type of fish community I'll eventually be keeping. I was introduced to a myriad of different plant varieties and they had a wonderfully diverse set of options to choose from. I ended up purchasing 5 plants of two different kinds and a wonderful piece of prepared driftwood for my setup. I also bought a plant solution to introduce and maintain for my water that promotes growth. Finally, because I look to continue my business relationship with Austin Aqua Dome, I purchased a one year membership that will likely pay for itself as my odyssey into this passtime grows. High fives all around and I can't wait to go back again and, if my S.O. doesn't kill me, maybe start a 2nd aquarium in the near future!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNnZEbU5nEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Austin+Aqua-Dome/@30.229189,-97.7858588,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x8644b4caed938353:0xd15c7b293e7a71b1?hl=en",ChIJU4OT7cq0RIYRsXF6Pil7XNE,Tropical fish store,5.0,Austin Aqua-Dome,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzvTCZ1dR9jzbJqUaP3jWK9k5QhwuCKQhrCG9j=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

It was perfect for my 2 year olds birthday present but we went on a Saturday so her dad could be present and it was so over crowded it was hard for her to enjoy it as much as she would have had it been less crowded. They had a tide pool for the kids to touch sea creatures which was cool. My cousin brought her 2 year old on a Tuesday around noon and barely anyone there and she said I'd probably find it much more enjoyable with baby girl had we gone then so well have to do it like that next time because there's sO much to see you could easily enjoy going a second time as well as your kiddo if they love animals like mine does. It was awesome 5 stars aside from over crowding maybe they could have more control over the times and let less people in at a time and have legit ticket times or stone more organization in that way to make it easier first you to see everything.üòÉ(bad pics sorry was taking videos and it won't let me post videos üòî),ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzaUphWUVBEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/SEA+LIFE+Michigan+Aquarium/@42.7036708,-83.4407003,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x882495b22d0ac751:0xe518db4be74a1e42!8m2!3d42.7036708!4d-83.2965047!16s%2Fg%2F11c3khpvgx?hl=en",ChIJUccKLbKVJIgRQh5K50vbGOU,Aquarium,4.0,SEA LIFE Michigan Aquarium,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQ_z6NVVlmy0XUhfj5Zg7izrHY8mvaPH8S7PjP=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"SEA LIFE Michigan Aquarium is a great place to go.  The entry fee is a little high but in line with other aquariums around the country.  If they brought it down a little I believe they would see even more traffic and serve a greater part of the community.

The exhibits are kept neat and clean on the outside.  There were just two tanks they seemed to be having problems with but it was obvious they were working on it.  The staff was welcoming and engaged.  We had a slight difficulty at exit getting our ‚Äòfree photo‚Äô when we were directed to go back into the line to get it.  That was worked out satisfactorily.

They have apparently been actively engaged in breeding and helping wounded wildlife but I did not see anything specific about that in the exhibits other than some numbers posted at entry.

They have a wide variety of sea life on display and they all appeared in good health.  Most of the displays had plastic plants in them.  It would be nice to see more natural environments for the creatures and to examine them.

The viewing tunnel was very crowded.  There was no docent there and several patrons took the opportunity to rest and enjoy the tunnel while a single line file of other patrons had to navigate through along with carriages and mall baggage they might have with them.

"My family and I enjoyed the aquarium. There are a lot of great sea life to enjoy and some games to play. Older children would probably not enjoy this as much as the younger ones. Still a great experience and place to educate on all things water life.
As a person who has enjoyed many aquariums throughout the states, this one is very small when doing price comparison. If you use the coupons and discounts available (AAA, buy legoland get aquarium, or child free coupons) it is worth it. However the price without such is not worth it.
Example: (walk up pricing)
TN adults are $35 & child (3-12) $22
MI adults are $24 & child (3-12) $19
TN -We spent 4 hours exploring 2 HUGE buildings Sea & Fresh water life(could have explored longer too). Played several free games. Touched turtles.
MI- 1 hour exploring played 2 free games, and touched turtles.

Is it fun? Yes

Meatballs and the sauces were very good!!! The other entrees portions are all too big. Seafood risotto was not bad, I would prefer the seafood not cooked so much that they were a bit chewy.

We all laughed over the one giant piece of ravioli, that was not expected. It smelled really good and was told that it tasted very good too.

"Came here originally on my birthday last year . The food is just amazing. The chef / owner is from Italy and knows how to cook. The homemade pastas were amazing , the staff knew what kind of wine my wife needed , as their wine menu was very overwhelming. Huge wine menu lol .

My wife wanted come back on Valentine‚Äôs Day weekend on a Saturday , and it was such a lovey experience ..... we started with the fried calamari. It was crunchy and tender. Got a nice $30 of Cabernet and it was smooth. I don‚Äôt really drink wine but I was able to drink a whole bottle with wifey . Next we got a shrimp / crab dish and 4 cheese ravioli. Outstanding entrees. Didn‚Äôt look like much but we were very stuffed . Last was our lime something cake ....

We did come at 8pm so the crowd died down so our service was pretty spot on .

Love love love this place !

***updates*** 12/21/2020

Just came here on a Monday for my bday and it was perfect ! When we got there at 6pm there was only us and another table. We practically had the restaurant for a good 30 minutes to ourselves . Usually this place is packed but probably due to covid it has slowed down. They closed their larger dining area. We had a bottle of wine , few appetizers , and two main courses ! Our food was awesome ! And service was great ! Wish it was busier so the restaurant stays in business.

"This was our anniversary and we wanted to celebrate with fine tasting Italian food. This was it! Outside on their patio, sipping a tasty, tart cocktail and a nice Barbera red. We love caprese and adding basil pesto is a keeper. The Tuscan Nido was perfect-handmade and hands down the largest ravioli-the added surprise of an egg yolk hidden inside was genius!

"Excellent service, friendly staff, huge wine list and tasty food. We had a great bottle of Chianti. Then we split the calamari and caprese. The calamari was perfectly cooked, not chewy at all. I saw the guy in the kitchen breading it. The caprese was honestly one of the best I've had. Being winter, the tomato wasn't the best but the mozzarella was perfect. It was topped with a delicious pesto. And the plate was drizzled with the thickest balsamic glaze I've ever had. It was almost like caramel. The balsamic glaze was extremely flavorful. For our main courses, we had the Tuscan Nido and the wild mushroom Tagliatelle. The Tuscan Nido was basically a giant ravioli. The filling had great flavor. I loved the pops of whole peppercorn and the fried sage leaves. The pasta was clearly homemade and perfect. The wild mushroom Tagliatelle was even better. The mushroom flavor was amazing and the smell was just divine. Normally, I would have liked to see the addition of truffle to a dish like this but honestly, I think it was near perfect without. The mushrooms just had such good flavor. To top off our meal, the lady who seated us came around to see how our meal was. Based on our conversation, I assume she was the owner.

"Today my family and I arrived at Golden Corral in Sterling Heights Michigan and were extremely disgusted with what we saw.

After paying (over $60) we finally found a table that was clean. When we went to the bar, we saw nothing but food thrown all over the floor, the bar was disgustingly dirty, and completely empty. Servers and the manager were just walking through the food all over the floor, never cleaning anything at all. It was so bad, I decided to take photos as well for you.

After sitting down, it took us 15 minutes to get silverware, and over 25 min to get drinks. Our server never cleared the plates from our table when needed either.

As for at the bar; the woman doing the steaks was more interested in flirting and trying to get a date with a customer than actually helping customers, cleaning anything, or even putting steaks on the grill. The salad bar was basically full of rotting fruit and slimy lettuce.

At the desert bar, there was chicken on the floor, food everywhere. My biggest concern was the fact that there were peanuts all over the bar, mixed into other toppings, on the cookies, on the brownies, etc. As someone with an extreme nut allergy, this type of cross contamination is deadly, let alone disgusting.

For $60 my family and I ate one plate of food that was cold by the time we got our silverware because the bar was empty and never refilled. I understand that places may be short staffed but that is not an excuse for any of this. If the health department would have walked in, the place would have been closed immediately‚Ä¶.and honestly should have. When the manager, the staff, the servers, and guests are having to walk through food on the floor and nothing is being cleaned or refilled, that‚Äôs awful. We have been here several times and this is the most disgusting restaurant I have ever seen.

Disgusting.  If only zero stars were available.  Place needs a full cleaning. Maybe rip out disgusting carpet and try vinyl flooring... Plastic cutlery? Maybe since covid?   But had to ask for it vs getting at payment and entering.
Many tables were not wiped down without asking after awaiting a significant time. Unused tables stacked with piles of dishes. This st 4pm so not a full dinner rush.   I'd hate to see it during rush time.

The buffet had many empty pans due to non attention.

We used to love coming to this place especially on a friday! Now a days days the food quality has dropped tremendously. The options of which they serve you is bare minimal or cold. Went to get meat on friday there is no special meats any longer. The ham and ribs were cold. Steak used be a better quality as well. Salad bar doesn't include bacon anymore? No mk or chocolate fountain. Only 2 pie selections. As I said the quality used to be better. All of these are things noticed by my child it's her favorite restaurant. My waitress was awesome ty Brittany. Over all the food was def not fresh all but the steak the options were slim and not very tasty. I tried a little of everything even the bourbon street chicken used to be better. I understand that sometimes business is slow but this was dinner rush 6 pm to 7pm .

"This was a fantastic adventure. I would recommend going as a group of 2 or more. As this would be a very bland one person experience. The other people make it a blast.

Its relatively cheap, only about 10$ a person, for an hour or longer depending on the size of your group.

If I had to describe my least favorite experience, it would be the lack of variety of some hole layouts. Few are rather creative, and have some cool glow in the dark features. Most are fairly straight forward and require very little creativity to sink the putt. I would have liked to have seen holes that allowed two or three different ways to complete them. Even this was not enough to deter me from having a great time at low cost.

They do offer different types of discounts and party plans. This was an excellent way to have fun out of the sun. The staff was friendly and courteous.

Also they have really respected the social distancing brought on by COVID19. Each putter and ball is wiped and sanitized before each new user.

"Would highly recommend this great little Campground. The property was clean, very well kept, and had everything you could need. Play Set for kids, cozy tent & RV sites, coin operated showers, laundry, dishwashing station and even a place for fishermen to clean their catch. Convenient store with the basics as well as some handmade goods and local foods. The quaint little grill in the back makes a mean burger and has tons of food options. I enjoyed the seafood basket which was plentiful (shrimp, clam, scallops & fries).
Everyone we came into contact with was friendly and helpful. The only downside I might mention is that there is only of toilet and one shower for the whole park. We came in the off season, so this was no big deal. Not sure what it would be like in the busy season.
Overall a great place and we loved our stay! Will be returning for sure! Location is key and this place is perfectly situated between, Rialto Beach, La Push, Forks, & the Hoh. Didn‚Äôt hurt that they fully embrace the Twilight mania that has over taken this area either.

"This review is really mostly about the showers. Haha. Stopped in the store here today during an epic journey through the Olympic peninsula. I was searching for places to shower and came across a trip advisor review from 8 years ago that said there were showers available for 75 cents.  After hiking around in the sea breeze and camping out, I really wanted a shower, so we decided to stop in and ask if they were available and luckily were pointed in the right direction. There is a single stall shower in a small room, it is self serve, you just need quarters. 4 minute showers available for $2.00, 5 for $2.50 6 for 3.00 and 7 for $3.50.

They have a Twilight themed menu for those visiting for fun(; I had the Bella Bananas Split and it was amazing. I'm a vegetarian and had a few options which was nice. I had a salad and my husband and kids had burgers. There was hardly any crumbs left. The onion rings were AMAZING. Beer battered and fried to perfection. There is four of us and we each got a meal with sides and everyone got a dessert for $50 bucks the prices were very fair. The workers were all so nice and friendly.

"You will miss your bed at home real quick! The only thing keeping me from giving a two star or worse rating was the fantastic customer service: front desk, housekeeping, and the breakfast attendant. Otherwise this Hilton-brand Hampton Inn and Suites is not worth the higher price point than many of the other options in Aberdeen and is way overdue for a refresh (maybe we can blame Covid-19). The colors and finishes in the lobby, halls and rooms are dinged, scuffed and just plain ugly. The king-sized bed in our non-suite room was caving in and needing replacement. When booking, be aware not all the rooms are like the pictures on the site, some are very plain with no kitchenette, just an awkward mini fridge and microwave by the desk in the room. No real dresser if you like to unpack just a small hutch with sticking drawers that the TV sits on. Pull out style love seat sofa seemed like a great option for the kids, but the window was very drafty and our son about froze the first night. The blankets were very thin waffle weave style. We asked for a second for the next night and he put on extra clothes and was okay. Not comfortable enough for an adult, he slept on it backwards, because even he could feel the metal. The bathroom was a good size which was nice for a family traveling with younger kids, but the bathroom fixtures were loose and the shower almost didn't work. The toilet took several flushes. The pillows in our room weren't the usual mixture of firm and soft (feather and polyfill as it turned out for here), but housekeeping brought us new ones when we inquired at the front desk during breakfast. The breakfast was quite good. Many choices, including an oatmeal area with fixings, plus other hot options, waffles, fresh fruit, yogurt, biscuits and gravy one morning and the next eggs and sausage patties. Coffee options were hot. Pool and hot tub area was small, but we had fun anyways. Pool towels were restocked regularly. Elevator floor became sticky one evening, but as we were in and out, right away they had it mopped I noticed. Again, great customer service that way. We also did laundry which was weirdly on the second floor off in the corner, kinda creepy, but washing and each dry cycle was just a dollar in quarters.

The food was delicious my friends and family keep asking about the Tuscani chicken. Even provided the kids table with a special meal. Ballroom looked amazing!! Also the bartender sheila made really good drinks! All of our family & friends enjoyed the night!

"This place is epic.  When you first step into the park you're welcomed Disney-style by cast members hoping to share their story and complain about the mystery that has ""befallen the land"".  As you move from area to area interacting with characters (usually about 30-40+ each night) you find out more about this mystery.  Eventually, you realize that everything might not be as it seems and there are actually multiple mysteries and many different storylines to enjoy.  There are multiple levels of story that can be enjoyed by the first-timer, the introvert, extrovert, or the seasoned park-goer.  Come to socialize, to observe, enjoy the pretty lights and music, or to practice archery and axe throwing.  This place is truly loved by my 10-year-old boy, my teenage girls, and their grandparents.  My wife and I have taken some date nights here and didn't even tell the kids we went (or we'd be in trouble).  I am not into D&D and I hate dressing up for Halloween (sad, but true).  I'm a shorts and T-shirt kind of guy.  I still enjoy coming here again and again and playing along with the story and meeting new characters. Many people do dress up so if you're into that, you won't feel out of place.  While we don't dress up we still feel like we belong. Think of this as a ""live theater"" performance where you step onto the stage and the acting takes place close around you.   In the past, we've had season passes for Disneyland and have spent time in Disney World.  We also have had season passes for our local theater and love to attend.  I have to admit, the acting here is superb and a 10 out of 10!  I have been in situations where the tension could be ""cut with a knife"" and other situations where I've cried with the characters.  If you plan a trip, I'd recommend attending more than one evening.  You won't regret it.  The entrance fee is very reasonable (less per hour than a movie ticket) and the food there is well-priced and amazing (changes each season).  Make sure you arrive 15 minutes before they open and plan to stay until closing time.  Wear comfortable shoes. You don't have to walk a ton if you don't want to and I've seen people in wheelchairs and electric scooters....  but if you do enjoy walking and you get into the story, expect to get your steps in for the day!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvNVpIRTlnRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,5.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_SXncuZhsWLiTnTiO5lSWV6K1bwMt0JI3runO=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity
"This is a very unique place. It has a lot of potential. I can see it growing to be really popular. I write my experience with the hopes that improvements can be made to really enhance the place.

The park vibe:
Very cool idea. It did feel like we were in a whole different world. Sadly I could still see some things under construction which I wish was covered up like Disney does it. But I also understand the new business budget can‚Äôt afford that much. So not a big deal. I loved the characters walking around and being interactive. They were a lot of fun. At night the lightning is eery and fun. It would be kinda scary for young kids though. And it would be easy to loose a child in that lighting.

The costumes:
Very high quality costumes the employees wear. But also, many guests of the park wear costumes too. Which is fun but kinda difficult to tell who is an employee and who isn‚Äôt. I wished the employees had glowing name tags so I could know who to ask for directions and stuff from. It would be awkward to ask another guest for help.

The food:
I LOVED the sandwhich I ordered. Very yummy! The monte Cristo at the dessert shop was very oily though and I wished it had been cooked in an air fryer instead. I also wish the menu had pictures. It‚Äôs a lot easier for me to order things that I can see.

The magic show:
The beginning was really boring. Your typical magic tricks that you see. Was not a fan of the ‚Äúword‚Äù trick because there was no magic to it. He never even said what the word was. Maybe that was a distraction for his next trick but I didn‚Äôt like it. The last trick was awesome! One of my all time favorite tricks to watch. Very impressed with that. Giving his act more of a WOW the entire time would really make this place have more credibility. Go all out!

The train:
We loved the train. Super fun to see the whole town and go around the train. Fun for kids and fun for us. Just a short little ride.

The map:
I like the graphics of the map. That is user friendly. But the magician tent and stuff isn‚Äôt on it. And all the locations seem to be in the mythical words and make it not user friendly at all. I had no idea what there was to do and where it was. Many people around me were confused too. I wish we were given a map when we entered and I wish there were big maps around the park. I just need it to say the different places and what there is to do and explore at each one.

Getting Lost:
Aside from what I already talked about with the map, I wished each location had a solid sign of what it was right on the building or tent. I wasn‚Äôt sure what buildings we could and couldn‚Äôt go in. I need more than a chalkboard in front of the magician tent that says...
‚Äúmagic show‚Äù and then a sign at eye level with the times of the shows. I arrived at 6:00 and the sign said magic show every half hour. But they didn‚Äôt open till 7:00 so at 6:30 I was confused why nobody was there.

Haunted House:
Sadly I had to work and leave early so we were not able to experience the highlight of the park. Next time I‚Äôll give you some info on that.

Website:
The website for sure needs help. It needs to be more simple in layout and show what‚Äôs in the packages and what there is to do better. I needed everything disclosed. I kept reading about some sort of circus and when I asked some of the employees about it they said they were the circus.. I expected a circus show with animals and tricks. Not just characters walking around. Maybe it was a misunderstanding on my end but yeah really confusing. There is also a bird show that looks pretty cool from online but I wasn‚Äôt able to go to that either because I had to leave early for an important work zoom call.

I wish there was a restroom on the north side of the park too.

I also think it would be AWESOME to have a costume shop! Also little kiosks around selling hot coacoa, hand warmers, and fun merch.

Don‚Äôt let the 2 starts fool you. This place has the potential to be incredible. Just a few tweaks will make a big difference.

"I was underwhelmed by my first visit, but I plan on giving them another shot.
I went oct 9th 2020.
The good:
The battle arena was lots of fun. It's the best thing there.
Archery was really cool. I wish the range was bigger so more people could shoot.  The wait to try archery is long. Like 30-45 minutes long.
My wife loved the hats and stuffed dragons.
Axe throwing looked neat but only two people could try at a time so the line was even longer than the line for archery.
We entered a large circus tent and saw a really fun show. Fire eaters, magic tricks, and gymnastics were all great to see.
There was a dragon skeleton.
The bad:
Long waits for most activities.
Some buildings were under construction and landscaping was a mess in some areas.
Questing for the various guilds could use a lot of improvement. Most of the entry level quests just don't sound fun. They will tell you some vague thing like ""learn a secret"", ""gain someone's trust"", or ""learn three people's names"". I wish the tasks were more fun. Why not find a monster? Fight somebody? Climb something? None of the quests sounded fun except for archery, and after I waited a long time in line to do that they closed down the range for a tournament right before it was my turn to go. Super disappointing.
Half the park was taken up by their haunted maze. It looked fun, but it was sold out for the night.
I'll probably go again in the winter or summer and just spend the whole day in the arena.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNDQtQ2x3RRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,3.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMexSyMXoAPcRiDDHjL4LpdTMCgDJJus_GOWst=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"Evermore park is a great theme park based on performance and costumes. As well as a park with a unique, ominous, fantasy atmosphere. Though it was not quite complete when I attended (opening night celebration) as several buildings were fenced off or still under construction, it has immense promise. The main appeal to me wasn't the gorgeous hand chiseled decorations, imported 400 year old statues, live instrument music, fantasy taverns filled with druids and fawns, or the dark gothic feel. But rather the inadvertant way the park enables everyone to show up as themselves. Free of judgment, and equally included. Regardless of their appearence or uniqueness.

It feels like they've got a a ways to go till their park is fully built and their vision realized but for $15 a ticket with few activities costing extra, this place is a steal! I would expect to pay more than I did for a fire dance and aerial silk show alone but that was only one of the many things they offered.

"OVERVIEW - 4.8
Came here as a work activity.  We were enticed by how elusive the place is on details, let alone online.  We actually ended up looking at Evermore's social media to get a better understanding.

LOCATION - 5
Ever more is located in Pleasant Grove not too far the freeway and other surrounding businesses such as Essential Oils.  I had to use a GPS to find the location and then parking was a little confusing (I parked in the back thinking it was the front.)

PRICE - 4
Pricing was a little steep for my liking, but it was worth the experience.  My daughter had just turned 6 and so I had to pay for her, whereas if she was 5 or under she would have been free....  If I had to name the prices, I would set $15 at the perfect price for adults.

PRODUCT/SERVICES - 5
This is where this place excels!  The attention to detail was remarkable!  I was impressed by the Evermore cast.  They played their roles rather well.  I enjoyed the various roles they had as well such as the Druids, which were both serious and kind, the executioner was rather intimidating, the fairies were enlightening, the dragon trainer was so kind to my daughter.  If you have a chance to meet her do it!  She was awesome with my daughter.  I was even convinced that dragons were real after talking to her.

POINTERS/PERKS - 5
The objective of Evermore other than walking around and enjoying the detail is to interact with the cast.  Talk to them, go on quests.  They will give you tiny missions if you ask what you can do for them.  Keep in mind as the night progresses (especially near Halloween), that details and new quests can change.  Another trick I learned is sometimes you can listen in on someone else completing a quest, and then you come by a few minutes with the same details...  I would also recommend that if you have a poor memory like me, you may want to have something to jot down details such as a small notebook or your phone.  That's another detail, you may want to have a phone in case you get separated from your party as it is very likely.

If you complete a certain amount of quests you can become honor positions.  Such as a co-worker and his girlfriend both became honorary knights.

EMPLOYEES - 5
This is where they excel!  They stay in character the whole time.  Their details to their lives is amazing.  I also love it when characters interact with one another.  I saw a fairy talk to a soldier like they were the best of friends.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJckpxWjZRRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,5.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqKEXLjXU0ig259a2icmjcWOhpS2L3rjEqQSM-=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity
"Fun immersive experience. We went with a group and it was a lot of fun to talk about and speculate about things together. It also allowed us to break up and gather info from various characters and then come together and share knowledge. All of the characters were wonderful and some were absolutely delightful to talk to. I also enjoyed trying out the archery and seeing all the elaborate decorations. The animals were also a lot of fun. We had a group of adults and a toddler and we all had a blast.

One tip: bring a fully charged phone. Some of the quests required you to take pictures. Also, they give you a booklet when you enter the park, but they ran out of pencils. So I used my phone to take notes (it was helpful for remembering character names and things we were looking for on our quests).",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3anJtbzFRRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,5.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6Hx27Ktpj2nPqo-pawTsDSNpEm_HwvOpWLDbN=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

Not only do you see characters here, but you interact with them, asking them questions and weaving your own way into the story as a participant.

"Valentine's Day dinner experience was like being stuck at point of the mountain during rush hour. You're just stuck in the miserable experience with everyone around you because they already took your money.

We made reservations and thought it would be a good experience since it was their 3rd day of the Valentine's Day dinner and also because they had a set menu, in theory making it more efficient.

This was not the case. First they had two entrances to the check in desk meaning people that had been waiting in an established line for 15-20 minutes, just to check in, were getting cut off by people just arriving. The staff was not able to check people in, take them to their seats and manage the flow of traffic because there were just two of them running the desk.

Once we were seated, we had no cups, no silverware and it took a solid 15 minutes to get our preordered soup and salad. It was another 10ish minutes after the soup and salad came that we finally got silverware and cups. Between finishing soups and salad and receiving our main course, it was nearly 1.5 hours and the grilled veggies were incredibly cold. The Mahi Mahi was ok, but the steak may as well have been jerky, no exaggeration, it was difficult to cut with a knife. We had seen the wait times and sent our desert ticket in with our main course so thankfully that came out promptly but others around us were waiting at least 15 minutes to get their desert.

All of this would have been more understandable if it had been a full menu and if it was busier but it was a very limited, preselected menu and honestly, not very busy considering it was valentines day. I counted 26 tables plus bar seating and some of the tables were even empty. When wait staff would come out to the dining area, everyone's attention would shift to them in hopes of catching their attention.

I would not attend or recommend attending any sort of dining event here to anyone. There are some very clear organization issues that the customers as well as the waiters/waitresses are paying the price for. It was incredibly frustrating to experience for a special occasion. The only silver lining was our waitress had some funny jokes even though she was clearly frustrated herself.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoc2FYU1BREAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,1.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBBBCbVueorh84S46E2h2xHKlAI5n0I6mIXxHW=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"I think it's definitely worthwhile and would have been a lot of fun if we weren't in a rush. Our experience was about a 3-star, but I think it definitely can be a 5-star experience if you give yourself enough time. I give it 4-stars overall because I want to see improvement in their customer care and outdoor lighting.

Evermore is an immersive experience akin to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Universal Studios), Fantasyland (Disney), and Ghost Town (Knott's Berry Farm). There are a lot of characters to interact with, but no thrill rides. (There was a train ride, but it broke own the day we went, possibly due to weather.) It's definitely something you'll want hours to explore. I recommend getting the park map when you get there and seeing what is going on.

It was a lot of fun once we got settled in. But they do a pretty bad job of preparing new guests for the experience, so the first 10-15 minutes we're really stressful for us. Make sure you have plenty of time before any scheduled events.

We checked in at the front gate and had to work out what to do to get refunded on our train tickets. We had bought the additional Christmas Carol experience and they hadn't given us any information at the gate on how to redeem it. Luckily, we found someone else doing the Christmas Carol experience who told us where and how to redeem our tickets. Unfortunately, we ended up missing the beginning of the performance because of how long it took us to figure out what was going on.

We had about 30 people attend our Christmas Carol performance, which was probably the most it could handle. It was definitely hard for everyone to get the full experience. Additionally, someone had a double wide stroller, which slowed the group down a couple of times because of really narrow doorways and the uneven/poorly-lit pathways. It would have been fine, but the actors weren't trained on how to help someone with a stroller/wheelchair. It seemed pretty ADA and handicap accessible.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTMWQ2Wll3EAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,4.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIKOQZr6ZpqXxvh8y5JWWhoXezU_Aej29sE_Mk=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"I want to love it BUT the park still has a lot of room to improve. The line to get in was unnecessarily long for having bought tickets and signed the waiver online. We waited 55 minutes before even getting inside. They needed more people at the entrance.
And no one let you know what to do once you were inside. I had watched some YouTube videos before hand and thought we were given character cards and an intro quest but after the long wait all we got was a map. So we started just by walking around aimlessly and exploring. It wasnt til 30 minutes later we realized the intro quest was on the back of the map! Would have been nice if the employee who gave us the map had told us that! And no one told us how to distinguish park employees from guests. (Because some guests had really elaborate costumes...) We figured out over time it was the people with green pendants.
But the BIG disappointment was after completing the first quest we went to the kettle cafe and turned in our gold to level up! The next quest we assumed would be something different but they simply handed us the same quest again and said they would have different ones in the future. They did say that there were quests to join each guild but it just felt like there was no reward or sense of accomplishment for that first quest. And the guild we wanted to join (the dragon trainers) we were told were ""sick"" or infected and were currently hold up in a building that was boarded up. So not sure if that meant we were supposed to find a way in side as part of the game or that the employees were just not working that night. We didnt stay to find out. We soon left after that after about 2 hrs.
But as I said I want to love it. The park did have a few things going for it:
The decorations and details were really awesome.
The actors characters seemed really cool and the ones we interacted with were nice and did a good job.
I would have loved if there was more to do. Bottom line all the quests (at least the ones available) seemed to be go somewhere talk to someone. And alot of the time the actors were surrounded by other guests so you had to wait to talk to them. The main areas to interact were crowded.
For the cost price I dont think it is worth it... Yet. I think they need some more actual attractions. It felt kinda empty. If you absolutely love DnD you could probably go spend 5 hours there and enjoy it completely. But if you prefer solo RPG videogames I'd say spend the money on those instead. For me and my wife it cost $64 bucks and now I kinda wish I had just bought a new videogame lol.

"We visited for the first time during the 2020 Christmas season.  Highly recommend paying extra for the Christmas Carol experience, it was amazing! The acting - especially the parts of Scrooge and Charles Dickens - was excellent, better than we expected. The way you follow the characters through the park to different locations as the story unfolds was unique and so much fun! There were indoor and outdoor settings - some of which are only accessible for Christmas Carol attendees. The Christmas Carol experience was slightly interactive also, which made it even better.  Our young adult children all loved it, as did we. We would go back again for that alone! The Christmas Carol takes about an hour (we wouldn't have wanted it any shorter, we enjoyed it so much), so we didn't have as much time as we had hoped to see the rest of the park before it closed. So, if you are doing the Christmas Carol, be sure to leave extra time before or after to enjoy the rest of the park. The archery and ax throwing ends at 9:30, and the lines were a little long before that, so we didn't do either. Most of the actor characters we came into contact with were easy to talk to, and we really enjoyed our interactions with them! But some were too preoccupied with their interactions with other actors/characters to talk to us, so that was a little disappointing. The costuming is excellent, and the overall feeling within the park is magical.  Sometimes it was hard to tell between the paid actors and visiting patrons who dressed up, but the glowing necklaces helped. We enjoyed the fire dancers and the puppet show, and the hot chocolate was delicious! If you dress warm, the cold isn't so bad, and there are plenty of fire pits throughout the park to warm up by.

"I want to be super clear: I love Evermore. I've gone 3 times now and had a great time every time, except for this last one during Lore 2021.

The Haunt was a fun idea, except the time we reserved to go through it didn't matter at all. We spent an hour waiting in line to go in, far and away after our reserved time. Well, we thought, at least we get to go to the second haunt, maybe that one won't be as busy! Nope. We spent more time in line, then the second haunt that we paid for was the EXACT SAME haunt again, with a slightly different ""quest"". The quest was different by about 2 or 3 different lines in the script from the actors (who were wonderful, as always, but still). We were very disappointed with the haunt experience.

We also got combo tickets which included food vouchers. Guess what we did? Waited in line another 45 minutes for sub-par food. I think I saw about 2 people in the back making the food for hundreds of patrons. (Absolutely not the workers' fault!) Evermore is simply not equipped to handle this many people.

Perhaps if they limited the number of patrons in the park, so there are less people in general, it would help? I would happily pay more to enter if I knew I wouldn't spend literally 1/2 the time I spent there in lines. It's either that or bump up staffing to accommodate all of the people there.

I love love love Evermore with all my heart, and I so badly want them to succeed, but I wish some of the energy they put into their spectacular sets and costumes and actors also went towards straight up logistics. Even the bathroom situation is lacking. Only three stalls in the women's bathroom? No wonder there is always a line going around the building.

They tried something new, which is commendable! But in practice, it clearly wasn't the experience that was marketed to us.

I'm hoping that for the Winter theme they'll have learned a few things from the what they tried with Lore. I have every confidence that they'll try to improve the experience for their guests who love them and want them to succeed! And I'm looking forward to hopefully coming back to edit this review after we visit in the winter.

"Enjoyed my time here from a visual perspective. very well thought out as far as their displays and attractions. We went during the winter time during the Christmas festivities and got their activity pass.

Wasn‚Äôt particularly impressed with their staff. They seemed to hire highschool kids who do cosplay as a hobby. Many didn‚Äôt seem to treat it like a job. Although they were supposed to be in character I saw a lot of them on their phones and not really taking pride in their work. As the face of evermore I really expected a bit more in that capacity.

Additionally the ‚Äúice skating‚Äù was a complete waste of money. You walk onto a cold sheet of plastic with zero ice on it. They advertise it‚Äôs not true ice skating but this isn‚Äôt skating at all. It‚Äôs walking on plastic and that‚Äôs the experience. period. I am proficient at ice skating so it‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt know how to skate. If I went again I‚Äôd pay for general admission and that‚Äôs it.

The food was also insanely long lines (45 minutes, and this was after being told they ran out of food and we needed to come back in an hour) for great value freezer food that was reheated. It was worse quality than food I make for myself and I have pretty low standards. (Truly watched them rip open great value frozen fries and put them in the fryer, certainly tasted like it too)

"Evermore is an MMORPG video game brought to life. Within Evermore, you meet its citizens, learn about their history and struggles and complete tasks for them while exploring their world. For the muggles out there, think of it as an elaborate scavenger hunt.

The actors are what make this park happen. Throughout Evermore you'll find citizens who are either quest givers or general NPCs with helpful info. Most of them are great at what they do and play off of anything you say quite well. There are four guilds you can join and each have tasks for you to complete as initiation. We joined the Dragon Trainers after finding the elf rangers to be too snooty (and also not the best actors). I loved the actor who led the Dragon Trainers. He had a huge history of dragons in his repertoire and was just cheerful and believable. I honestly felt honored when he initiated us. It truly felt like I was playing WoW. We had quests that led to other quests that led to other quests. Some were for the overarching story and others were simple tasks like selling a magic item for a merchant. Some NPCs sat around telling ghost stories, acting out tales or singing songs.

There were a few cons, but all are things that are easy to improve and will hopefully be fixed soon. Firstly, the park itself is not complete and they do nothing to hide this. During the night this is fine because the darkness and choice lighting hide all the under construction parts. During the day, you can clearly see metal conduit, wood piles, orange safety cones, rebar, etc. piled in certain areas of the park. They do nothing to hide this and it kills the immersion. There's also little things they could easily hide like in the mausoleum there was a speaker you could clearly see that was generating monster sounds, in the aviary there was a giant A/C unit and in the middle of the field is an electrical box.

We attended on a Monday night early in the Lore season and it feels like they aren't at 100% yet. It was open 6-10 pm. We arrived just after 6 and clearly they weren't ready. We didn't receive a map when we entered or any instruction. We wandered around and saw employees/actors not yet on their game or ready to interact. This is where we were able to focus on all the poor immersion areas because we basically wandered aimlessly the first hour. However, even after dark when everyone was in place and quests began rolling, there were still huge areas with no NPCs or quest givers.

When we finally did track down a map, we saw on the back a huge task list of things to do and next to it it said, ""your first quest!"" We spent a lot of time completing these tasks only to turn it in in the end and learn the ""first quest"" was a smaller thing hidden in the image on the page and all the tasks we completed were ""just a scavenger hunt"" with apparently no reward. I think there was just a miscommunication somewhere with this but it was a bummer.

Another improvement that could be made is better marking for who is an NPC/citizen of Evermore versus players. They encourage guests to come in costume and many of us who attended were but that made it difficult for me to know ""is that elf over there someone I can talk to or another player like me?"" The quest givers wear a glowing light necklace which is great but the tavern dwellers and fairies and monsters do not.

Overall, I had a blast and LOVE this concept. I think they are working towards an app or some system to track your progress as a player and that would be really awesome!

I would recommend Evermore but not going out of your way for it. I don't think you should buy a plane ticket to SLC drive the hour to Pleasant Grove and get a hotel to attend, but it's worth a day drive or is definitely something to do if you're visiting Utah anyway.

"We went here the day after Christmas 2020 and took our four little kids with us. The kids say their favorite thing was the fire dancers that went on every hour. They also enjoyed the bird and reptile show and the knife throwing. I really like the architecture of the buildings and the lights were beautiful. We also rode the train around the park and had fun looking at all the lights and buildings.  If there was one point of criticism, it had to be the radio station being played on the train ride, it wasn't really consistent with the theme of the park and broke the immersion in the park's atmosphere.
The characters we talked to were all interesting with their own stories to tell. Definitely going to spend more time talking to characters and doing quests when we go without little kids.

My hubby and I spoke to Tundra Maximus the miner and explored the village and even a castle while we picked up side quests along the way. We warmed up with a little hot cider on our way to find Winter Weavers (elegant winter elves!). There were local vendors features handmade costume pieces, sculptures, etc. We wanted to free the ice giant but our dinner reservation came first, so we hustled to Vander's Keep. Oh my was the food delicious! Samantha Fox, our server, let us know the beef stew was inspired by a 19th century recipe and braised for hours.

"We had so much fun exploring the park and doing a couple quests! We were only there for about two hours. We brought our 4 year old daughter and she absolutely LOVED all the characters and how so many people were dressed up! She made me promise she could dress up as a fairy or pirate next time we go.

We did find starting out to be a bit difficult with the acorn quest from the fairy, but after asking for a hint we were finally able to find our first one and know what we were looking for! Finding the rest was MUCH easier after finding the first one! Everyone was so nice and it was so cool! I loved seeing all the other visitors fully enjoying themselves in full cosplay! Luckily there were enough people not in cosplay that we didn't feel awkward or stick out. I'm not talented enough to put together such wonderful costumes.

If you happen to be in a wheelchair or a knee scooter (I was on a knee scooter) there are a lot of cobblestone areas and one area that is a little bit of looser gravel, so be prepared for some bumpy areas!

"We ended up going to Evermore Park tonight and although it was not completely finished it was a great experience! The details are extraordinary and talking to the characters provides insight into the story of Evermore without giving too much away.

My kids had a blast running in between characters sending messages going on quests and collecting items. It was amazing to see them in an immersive environment and being part of a theatrical experience.

The character spent time with my kids and showed interest in learning about them and the characters that they had created for their cosplay. Further they helped them to feel as if they were part of the experience. Where else can you spend time with characters and have them remember who you are at the end of the night? This doesn't happen but at Evermore it did. It was so cool to have 5 6 7 or even 8 characters talking to my kids and myself at one time! It was extraordinary!

Justin the manager was an amazing man and went out of his way to make the night special for my son who is celebrating his birthday! When this park is completed, it is my opinion that it will rival Disney and be destination for people all over North America not just Utah.

This park is not just for dress up and taking part in a cool Theatre experience but is also an educational opportunity for students and adults. Learning about the animals, the gardens, the mythology and various historical aspects of the park is fascinating. The characters use dialogue that is rich with vocabulary and the actors take the time to teach the meaning of the words to the young people that are there. My kids walked away having learned new words and their meanings. This is a fun and educational place and I cannot wait to see how the educational Outreach programs develop! As an educator myself, I would love to partner with Evermore and help them develop these programs!

I was astounded by the details of this park and cannot wait for it to be complete! It is hard to understand what is going on at first but if you are open and talk to the characters and listen to what they're saying and ask questions- you will have a delightful time. I highly recommend that everyone give this Park a shot.

If you are a perfectionist you may want to wait until the park is officially open before you attend.

"This place was awesome! It got pretty crowded once it got dark but when we first got there it was really fun to look around at all the different booths and the scenery was beautiful. One part I really liked was the parrot named Max who could talk, dance and laugh with guests.

One thing I think could be improved is information about the events, shows, quests, and guilds should be more accessible and easier to understand.

"Beautiful park. Lots of trails, a small babbling brook to play in , a nice lodge , 2 guided cave tours. We went on the X cave, which was a little disappointing for an experienced cave tour lover, but a nice introduction to caving. Kids will especially love it since you're IN  A CAVE! haha. There are only a couple of highlights and not really anything kiddos will hurt if they touch (although touching is discouraged) Quite chilly inside. You might want a jacket. There are lots of above ground trails and the ones we wandered down were quite easy. The lodge is more upscale, with a nice stone fireplace in the lobby.

"We had a neighbor tell us about Carter Caves so we decided to do a day trip here. During our visit we toured X Cave, Horn Hollow, and Cascade Cave. The park was very clean and well organized. We didn‚Äôt know what to do and where to go at first but were quickly and easily able to find staff that showed us the ropes. Our first tour was with Tristan at the X Caves. Tristan was informative and the Cave was interesting overall we enjoyed it. The only thing we wish he would have done differently is slow down . We moved so quickly through the cave that it felt like at times we were trying to keep up with the group instead of getting to enjoy the experience. Our next tour was a self guided tour to Horn Hollow. We were informed that we needed to bring flashlights with us so we purchased some at the gift shop. The permit process was easy however finding the cave not so much. They literally circled it on the map and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs somewhere around here‚Äù and to stay on the green trail. We kept walking and walking at one point we saw a couple walking down what appeared to be a creek bed and wondered to ourselves is that the cave entrance? We pulled out our phones to Google it, it was. Then once we got to the mouth of the cave we saw that it was flooded. We were not aware that the mouth of the cave was going to be in a creek bed and the water at the mouth was already at shin level. Not wanting to spend the rest of that day in wet shoes and socks we decided to not venture inside. Our last tour of the day was to Cascade Cave. Our tour guide was Skylar. Skylar has a family history when it comes to this cave and it is clear that he is both knowledgeable and passionate about it. He has a great personality and really took his time sharing the cave with us. He also told us about some of the other caves and tours we would not have known about otherwise and would love to check out in the future. We were so thankful that our tour was with him as he really made the experience.

No water in the off season they do have electric. 20-30-50 amp. Two large bathhouses which one is open souring off season. Play grounds and a put put mini golf. Ice machines store is open during the offseason.

Welcome lodge is very nice it‚Äôs also where you will need to get permits for cave exploring.

Dogs are allowed on trails but not the caves. 2 people minimum to explore.

2000 acres of exploring with a small lake for fishing.
Must definitely a beautiful place anytime of the season.

"Awesome park. The guided caves are cool, the unguided caves are cool, the trails are cool, the land bridges are cool, and just the overall place is just fun to be around. I stayed in the cottages, and they are nice for one big or two small families. Well kept. Definitely recommend.

If you come, make sure to check out Horn Hollow cave. There‚Äôs a short little crevice near the main entrance of the cave, and if you follow that, it narrows and narrows. Prepare to be crawling on your stomach in an underground creek. You‚Äôll need to be pretty narrow and pretty flexible (I‚Äôm 6‚Äô and 180 lbs. and I made it though with some difficulty). It goes back a good 200 feet, until it opens up on this huge underground waterfall fueling the creek. It‚Äôs almost as big as the one in Cascade. I‚Äôm not sure if this water fall is well-known, but it‚Äôs well worth the difficulty of reaching it.

"So it's very confusing but we stayed at the Carter Caves Campground not the resort or cabins.
We arrived one day early figured we would try our luck. We were met on the office by a disinterested kid. Once we got through that, we discovered that our sight #8, had the electric pedestal aprox 75' from the site.
We returned to the office and were moved to sight #3. Once we backed in, we discovered that the electric pedestal had 20 or 50 Amp. No 30.
Back again and moved into #6. It worked but I had to back all the way to the end of the pad and my power cord just made it.
Water took two hoses to reach and had to wrap to the opposite side of the camper.
We had a nice view but the picnic table was not usable due the the slope.
The showers were ok but the curtain bottom was covered with mold.
Overall a busy Campground, dogs and some guy in a tow truck that liked to let everyone know he had an air horn.

Such a fun place! Tons of trails of varied difficulty. It's a lot better in the summer than fall/winter because leaves obscure the trails so it's easy to go the wrong way in the colder seasons.

"Why Eagle Harbor is the place you want to stay when in Door County?
Eagle Harbor is located right accross the bay and walking distance to Penninsula State Park. When we entered the property it was beautifully places homes giving you a royal feel of a town. The homes B&Bs are well kept and looks eye pleasing. Upon checking in the host was very friendly and informative about door county. They made us feel home. He check us in and off we went to our room Tilla. Tilla was the 1st room up the stairs on your left. Room was rather small but well designed and very cozy. The antique looks gave it a very stylish english look. The washroom was large enough and had a sky light to it. B&B main building was well decorated (pics attached) and well kept.

"Honestly I was not impressed, the kids loved it (8, 5, 2yrs) but it felt VERY make-shift. Soda and water machines were broken, only had pricey bottled drinks and no outside drinks allowed (really...?) Pizza wasn't too bad though my pepperoni tasted like it was cooked alongside some pineapples. The arcade games are ridiculously expensive and considering they only have like 8 games their ticket/toys costs we're outrageous. 5 tickets for a Tootsie roll that I just paid 3 dollars to get for my son to play 2 games (and now have 2 tokens/credits I can't use because the lowest cost is 4 credits most are 5) is ridiculously! 3 bucks for a small tootsies roll? wow...

"Unexpectedly exceeded my expectations! This picture of my 6 year old says it perfectly. We went there for a birthday party, and the party room (with flowers) was cute. The blow up slides, arcades and toys were all working and seemed pretty clean! The adults could play on the slides too with the kids which was so fun! There is this HUGE slide by the restrooms that took my 31 year old breath away! It was intense and made me feel like a kid again. Arcades were awesome. The kids had fun turning in their tickets. And they had a small sectioned off area for the little little kids which I would've appreciated when my 6 & 8 year old were little. We had a blast.

The party rooms looked cute, but i just peeked in through the windows. My kids were SUPER disappointed that the ball activity wasn‚Äôt working! And the entire place could use a good cleaning for sure. Once of the couches is broken and sagging.. and multiple chairs are cracked. The tables and chairs are white, and suuper  dirty.

"Enjoyed a nice breakfast today at Gaia. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. Our party of six was seated immediate on a Saturday morning.

Unpretentious, casual, warm interior. Small menu, but nice to have so many vegetarian and vegan options. Good to have the opportunity to try something different, outside the normal brunch fare.

I stuck with what I normally like - eggs & potatoes plus tried a fruit cup. It was a filling portion and cooked well. The potatoes were well seasoned and crispy. I also enjoyed the sourdough bread that came with my meal. The fruit was fresh and seasonal. Coffee was self-service and offered three options, with creamer available at request. I tried the Swiss chocolate brew and liked it a lot. My friend‚Äôs specialty French toasted looked amazing. It has tender sweet saut√©ed apples, cherry sauce, and almonds. Everyone had to try an apple slice - they were really good!

"Gaia House Cafe was very nice. The decor is slightly bohemian and very cozy with mismatched chairs and tables.We went on a Tuesday at lunch and got the Gaia Tempeh Ruben and the Banh Mi sandwiches.The coffee was excellent. The staff was very pleasant and the food arrived in good time. The price seemed a little steep for sandwiches but when you get homemade pickles and kraut it makes up for it. I couldn't tell where a good place to park would be, so we parked in the Irish pub reserved area with a risk of towing.

Some things to consider: add a bit more spread on the Banh Mi as it was a little dry; add a few completely vegan options to the menu as many of the entrees are so close but then have cheese; swap out those potato chips for a cup of soup.

"I loved this re-discovery recently! I vowed that if I ever noticed that Gaia Cafe was back  in any way I would maintain patronage as I used to frequent the Cafe when I was a student at Aquinas with friends and family as I maintained a vegetarian diet the majority of my time in attendance there. Thank you for coming back, I love the changes and the maintenance of staple favorites like B.Y.O.B. and Mean Green Burrito. I personally chose the Veggie Stash as recommended by my wonderful hostess (I selected the vegan options for cream cheese and cheese toppings as in recent years I have had to cut dairy out of my diet more fully). I had a lovely experience with the self service water and coffee, enjoying the flow of the community coming in and out of the Cafe as I spent a few hours there working on a few personal and professional goals and trying a new, but also nostalgic, meal.

For some reason I have not been able to get a good fresh fruit cup anywhere I have been for breakfast lately.   All three, excellent, fresh and delicious. Staff was friendly and happy to serve you.  Although the interior doesn't have the same vibe as the old Gaia it has it's own charm and coolness.

"Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have anything good to say about Gaia house . When we were sat down there was paint bubbling near us, probably due to moisture trapped behind the paint. And then a leak above. It‚Äôs not really an appetizing sight.

We were told that we wouldn‚Äôt be able to have espresso or lattes because the espresso machine was down. That‚Äôs fine. What I did take issue with was the self serve coffee station. For one, the way the glasses were stored was gross. The shelves were not clean. The cups were freshly washed. I could tell because they were wet, placed rim down. So that the dust and debris on the shelving was collected on the wet rims of the cups. And whenever you picked up a cup you could see the wet rim marked it left. These cups should be dry if you‚Äôre going to store them rim down. Drying them rim down traps the moisture inside (causing an unpleasant odor and taste), and damages the shelves, and is altogether unsanitary if the shelves aren‚Äôt even clean. Storing them rim side up would be a better option in this case . They are used often enough for collecting dust to be an argument for storing them rim side down. Sanitary conditions aside, for a vegan/vegetarian place for the only milk option to be whole milk was disappointing. Consider offering milk alternatives.

The food was even more disappointing . My guest ate his omelet , but I good not stomach my food. The cornbread French toast was incredibly dry, even soaking it in the butter and syrup didn‚Äôt revive it. The potatoes tasted fine but they were stale. Since it was the only semi edible thing available to me I picked at that instead of what I ordered. I only managed to eat half of one slice of French toast and didn‚Äôt want to take it home. We came out of our way to go here after seeing it on Instagram.

If you like watching adorable penguins doing their thing, getting up close to large fish, eels and even sharks and if you'd enjoy watching a sea lions play with their handlers, you'll enjoy this spot.

"Absolutely beautiful and incredible experience!!! ü§Øüòç I love how it is all handicap accessible, although I am not handicapped, my mother in law has a boot on her foot, so it was a great experience because of the accessibility. The penguin exhibit is absolutely amazing and just wonderful to sit and listen to the noise and when they would fight. I'm someone that is incredibly against any kind of zoo, or SeaWorld type of places but I did read up on this place and found that they do some sanctuary work and conservation as well so I agreed to go here and let me tell you ... When you walk up through the levels ... Such beauty such amazing fantastic views, the fish, the life that lives within this water was absolutely amazing and so very beautiful. Some things, fishes and other aquatic life that I have never seen and I loved it but my daughter just absolutely loved it and wanted a penguin. Also, the larger sea turtle in the giant cylinder aquarium, is 95 years old and when my mother in law was a child, that very same turtle was just a young little baby and than when my husband was a young child, this same turtle was mid aged and so big and beautiful. They have pictures from their times with this same turtle. Just a wonderful place, very informative, sea lions to watch them swim and play around outside as you waited was wonderful. Also, while we waited we got to walk around the giant walkway that surrounds the aquarium and also has the boats for people that want to go whale watching or just a boat ride. There's also the duck tour boats where they go from moving vehicle to a boat. It was fun to see the very old and antique ship too and to take pictures with my family on the ocean. Just beautiful and wonderful experience altogether. The gift shop has some pretty amazing items to buy!

"We were driving from Portland home to Canada and it was getting quite late so we found the little town of Shelton and it seemed like a convenient place to stop, being only an hour and a half from the Port Angeles Ferry. We googled a place to stay in Shelton and there was a very limited selection so we pulled into a couple and looked for reviews. Let‚Äôs just say they sounded like rat motels from what we read from other travellers. Once we saw there was a Super 8 in Shelton it seemed like the natural place to say as they are typically a decent place to stay being a franchise and all.

We checked in around 8pm and the front desk person was friendly although seemingly bored with his job. The lobby was clean and nice. We had a truck full of purchases that we didn‚Äôt want to leave outside overnight so it was nice that there was an emergency door close to where we parked for bringing all our stuff in. The front desk person did state that the hotel was located in a decent part of town and our stuff would probably be fine.

We paid $70 for the night which was high considering it was a fairly old hotel. It appeared to have been renovated at one point but the work was amateur at best. There were simple things like repairs to the towel bar which were just never painted over. Little touches like that go unnoticed when done but become BIG eyesores when left not finished. The temperature in the room was hard to keep consistent. I had to keep turning on and off the heat because the room likely is not well insulated. The bath towels were small and the caulking around the tub was gross. There was a mini fridge and coffee area, which was a nice touch. We could hear the voices from the other rooms and the aroma of the Mary J was thick in the hallways. We did not stay for the breakfast unfortunately as we were up and out to head for the ferry.

We didn‚Äôt use any of the amenities, we literally just used this hotel to sleep as a crash pad and it did its job. We felt it was pretty clean and mostly quiet and if we had to stay in Shelton again this would definitely be our first stop.

Your food and beverage prices are not high, they are ridiculously overpriced and do not reflect any bit of quality you‚Äôd expect from the price!

Best of the entire experience? The Boogie kid park. My grandkids loved it!  That earned the 2nd star ‚≠êÔ∏è in this review.

"Wow.  What can be said about this incredible attraction?  Much!  This is one of the best family activities I have seen in a long time.  This zoo is so well done and beautiful that photos can hardly capture it.  The number of things to see is way more than anyone would expect.  There is also a little train ride just outside the Zoo that takes people on a little tour of that local area.  Like many other attractions, things like admission and food are a little spendy. But then think what it takes to maintain such incredible facilities for the massive amount of displays, animals, reptiles, birds & fish and it's totally understandable and appreciated.

"The San Antonio Zoo. Not too much differs here from any other zoo, however it is a great place to walk around and take in the scenery regardless. Little kids will enjoy just as much as the adults.

The exhibits are spaced rather close together and allow anyone to see at least 2-3 animals, at one time, within the same 10 meter radius.

During the holidays, however, this place lights up in color and events, I recommend stopping by for the animals, but staying around during the holidays for the fun and festivities.

The zoo food is also good. It is a step above normal. I've been to many zoos and I would have to say this zoo's food ranks at number 4 out of 30.

"They have 2 hippos, what else does one need to see?‚Ä¶.
On a real note, this place was great. It‚Äôs not a large zoo (don‚Äôt even try to compare to San Diego zoo) but it had so much to offer. Hippos, elephants, rhino, lions, reptiles, snakes, birds, and lots more. We bought the fun day passes which included day passes to the park, train tickets, feeding a lory tickets, and the carousel tickets. The train is a miniature version the takes a stroll through the nearby nature park. Feeding the lorys is pretty cool, they give you a cup with nectar and the birds land on your arms, shoulders, head, pretty much everywhere. Then once the nectar runs out they start licking you. The carousel is a carousel with animals you ride, it‚Äôs is made for kids but that didn‚Äôt stop me.

Overall this park was small enough to see just about everything in about 1/2 of a day. It does have inclines and declines but a nice easy hike around the park.

"Great fun for the family. Went during the afternoon and waited for the Zoo Lights Christmas display. It was good, but a little crowded which can be tense during this pandemic. Masks are required in any indoor setting, but when outside they are not required.

The Zoo has spent some time clearing out sight lines and making it better for the children which is important to me with a child with serious vision impairment.

"It‚Äôs been about 10 years since I have visited the zoo and although the admission price is more than I recall, they have definitely made a LOT of improvements. I didn‚Äôt even recognize the place!

The giraffe exhibit is really cool because you can now walk onto a deck that is as tall as the giraffes and you can actually feed them.  Even if you don‚Äôt pay extra to feed them, you are able to walk on the deck and see them face to face ‚Äì it was AWESOME!

The Lory exhibit is also pretty cool.  You walk into this aviary and if you pay a couple of bucks, you can feed the birds ‚Äì they will actually land on your shoulders and arms to eat.  One in our group didn‚Äôt have any food but 3 or 4 of the birds landed on him as soon as he walked in the gate for some reason.

"In the past the Zoo was not the best (see my review from years past) the San Antonio Zoo has put a great effort into making the zoo the best that it can be and is doing a great job in the past few years. I highly recommend this zoo at this time.

I visited many zoos in my past. I grew up in N. E. Ohio and went to the Cleveland Zoo many times every year from birth till 18yrs and then I visited every couple of years, I've visited the Pittsburgh Zoo multiple times in my life, I've visited the Asheboro NC Zoo multiple times, I've visited the Virginia zoo, I've visited the Washington D. C. zoo, I've visited Disney Animal Kingdom and I've been to many super small side of the road places that call themselves zoos or Aligator /Reptile farms. I've seen a lot and have much to compare. The San Antonio Zoo needs some help. The animal habitats for many of the larger animals are not large enough and many of the outdoor habitats are somewhat overgrown and look like the animal couldn't be living in there but they are. The small animals are living pretty well and the zoo is clean and you can tell that it's a fight for the zoo staff to stay up on the upkeep. It's time to update or down size and give a few animals the space and care they deserve. Look to the Virginia Zoo. The Virginia Zoo is about this size but has put a lot of effort into the beauty of the park and great habitats for the small amount of animals that they have.

"I took the day off to visit the zoo to check out the rhino exhibit I keep hearing about. I was completely disappointed. The zoo is overrun by vultures in every single corner. Poor animals are sharing their tiny little space with these animals by the dozens and waiting to grab their food. I only took a few pics because I didn't think I'd be writing a review but once I left, 24hours later it still bothered me. I will never return to the San Antonio zoo or any other zoo because when I was little, I didn't know any better as to how confined and stressed these animals look. Many zoo animals experience continuous strange behaviors because they have been kept in captivity for so long or live their entire lives alone. Many parents will continue to bring their families and keep this pattern going. There are animal shelters that provide ample space for wild animals but the zoo captivity isn't one of them.

Firstly the animal collection is decent but not great. They cover almost all sections of animals like birds, cats, pachyderms, apes etc.,

I believe the areas provided for animals are smaller with respect to their sizes. Apes have the smallest cages I have seen. They have impressive bird collection. They serve food at certain points of the zoo.

I ordered the grilled chicken mezze salad and it was beautiful, but also delicious. The duck fat truffle fries were also phenomenal. We brought our kids (7 and 4) so Chef Matt made them a grilled cheese (he also added delicious crispy fries) and amazing buttered noodles. He even sent our server, Olivia, out to double check that multi grain bread was ok for the grilled cheese. Olivia was a wonderful server as well and knew everything about the menu, and the owner was there at the host stand greeting people as they came in. There was a big table of women having a fun lunch and the bar was full of groups of men hanging out as well. I am born and raised in Chesterfield and it‚Äôs totally unique and awesome for the area.

"Everything from start to finish was fantastic! The onion soup was flavorful and did not need the Gruy√®re cheese, but the cheese made it better. Perfect for a cold winter night! The steak tartare was also flavored well with peppers and the perfect ratio to the sauce. The chips made it even better. The duck breast matched well with the parsnip pur√©e and was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The flavor profile had a gamier edge.

"Pros:
Service staff other than the front desk was amazing
Food was awesome
Beds were comfortable
Gym setup was spot on

Cons:
Too musky and humid feeling inside the whole building
Vending machines malfunctioning
Front staff was very short with people
Too pricey for accommodations
Pool wasn't worth it
No microwaves in rooms
Elevators were sketchy and not working with ZERO ventilation

I think the bell staff was AMAZING and gave great suggestions for hot spots and restaurants. I felt they went above and beyond.¬† Along with the restaurant staff they had during the breakfast.¬† The gym facility was also a plus as you don't find many hotels that dedicate that much money to health amenities. Not to mention the cooling towels,¬† that was a nice touch! Beds were very comfortable too and clean.

As far as the stay goes I believe it was lacking significantly especially for over¬†$200¬†a night for a room with no view and for what was advertised online.¬† The air quality in the building all together was humid and sticky feeling the whole stay.¬† The elevator air was MISERABLE! The bathrooms in the rooms have no ventilation to move air when showering.

Numerous elevators were broken and unusable on a consistant basis to where I felt the need to take the stairs as a safety precaution not to mention with the fire alarms going off (I understand they might not have the ability to control fire alarms).¬† The mini fridges could only hold a few items and there was no microwave except for one we found 2 floors below us.¬† The vending machines also seemed to be malfunctioning as we had family choose water and it gave them a soda.

The breakfast served was AMAZING! The peach pound cake was out of this world!  Again the staff's hospitality... they were 100% Johnny on the spot. But with such pricey rooms I don't understand why there isn't a complimentary breakfast or to charge a lower amount.

The pool downstairs was also another area that was overly elaborated on the website and in person, was a complete let down...it was murky looking with high chlorination and not much to work with when more people got in (10 people was pushing space).

Upon our departure we called the front desk to have a cart brought up to take out our luggage,¬† we were told it would just be a minute and they would take care of it (this was really the only staff I don't feel weren't so welcoming). After 30 minutes of waiting we looked out into the lobby to see if it was busy because it was around check in time and there were NO lines.¬† My mother went downstairs and spoke to a bellboy about getting a cart and he had no idea someone was waiting for one to be brought up.¬† Again bellboy hospitality was spot on! He even clarified the quickest directions to get us home.

I also want to mention the cleaning staff... although we did not encounter them taking care of our room, everytime I passed someone in the hallway they were smiling and saying hello. This was our first time to Savannah and while being leery in new places I must say we felt like we were welcomed there as though we were family stopping in for a visit.¬† I just wish the hotel amenities were more up to the standards they present online. This was our first time staying in a Hyatt hotel as Hilton has been my #1 go to for years and venturing out has shown why I have been loyal to their hotel...

It's unlikely that I would stay here again, but if I did it would only be due to how awesome their service staff treated usüòä!!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBLTRiYlBBEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hyatt+Regency+Savannah/@32.9613127,-91.8300175,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88fb9e6410b40f99:0x27d1b05532b0a2e7!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d32.0815354!4d-81.0914177!16s%2Fg%2F1vzg32h5?hl=en",ChIJmQ-0EGSe-4gR56KwMlWw0Sc,Hotel,3.0,Hyatt Regency Savannah,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGiVyLwwg3SH4l89mB2-Xc5IJCO5GPjNjo05Ah=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"My husband and I vacationed in Savannah for July 4th.  We stayed at the Hyatt from June 30 to July 5. From the time we arrived til we left the customer service was excellent. The valets, restaurants servers and the front desk were all great. They also help you purchase tickets for the trolley tours. The hotel is very nice and we had a riverview room and watched the cargo ships pass by and the fireworks on the 4th. They have an elevator that takes you down to River St. The only con was breakfast wasn't included in the price. The buffet was $19.95, but it is very delicious.

The soap dish is broken and sharp.
My colleague has empty beer bottles on the top shelf in her closet. Toothpaste on the bathroom walls near the mirror. The mirror is filthy as are the grimy glass shower doors.
There's pink mildew growing all over the shower tiles. The towels are the worst. Super thin and non-absorbent. The pillows are terrible and the mattress is too firm. The blanket was so thin it didn't feel luxurious in any way. Lastly, there was some brown liquid dried on the toilet lid.

"Great location.  Inadequate housekeeping for a hotel of that standard and price.  A big pile of hair, yes indeed a pile, had been left in the shower drain.  Made me wonder if they had cleaned the bathroom at all.  Additionally, the main widow was completely smudged as if someone had applied a greasy face onto it.  We mentioned both issues to the front desk and the drain was cleaned up but not the window.  I ended up cleaning the window with a towel.  Another disappointment was the food options... Overpriced 7-inch pizzas for $16 per person, which fortunately tasted good, but $50 for 2 small pizzas and 2 beers... That's ridiculous.
Follow-up from management: received a reply that seemed like a ""cookie cutter"" apology.

"Thin Walls - We paid a decent price for our room on the top floor with Riverview. Not only did we hear the couple from next door enjoying themselves, but we felt the all the ""rocking"" in our bed as their movements transferred to us through the wall. The shared door probably didn't help the noise, but I've never felt bed movements through a wall before.

It was pretty disgusting. I called to request a transfer and was put on hold for ~10 minutes until the call dropped. I called again and was told that every room was taken. They offered for security to come and knock on their door but I declined. All things considered, our neighbors weren't being terribly loud or obnoxious. We just heard (and felt) all the ""commotion"". I don't necessarily blame our neighbors for cheap walls. Plus, a visit from security might encourage more noise/motion as retaliation.

I've stayed in several hotels and never made a google review. Wish I hadn't stayed in this one.

The entrees served were creative and beautifully presented. The restrooms were clean and well stocked. Every interaction with hospitality staff was terrific, a vast improvement on years past.

"Stayed here for the 4th of July week. Not a bad drive from here to Tybee island, about 30 minutes one way. Everyone seemed to enjoy their job or acted well. You can always tell the one or two ppl who don't want to be at work, but they still were helpful. The gym and pool are below the lobby are seem nice. Plenty of workout equipment and never crowded. Too many restaurants to choose from and the food was awesome! My wife and I did the breakfast at the hotel every morning with our daughter for the convenience. It cost around 20ish per person.

"So disappointed with my stay here and very disappointed with how our issues were handled. Came here with friends and booked 2 rooms next to each other. Both our rooms were filthy.

"So I love Hyatts and are even Hyatt members (but am not necessarily brand loyalist) and thought how can we go wrong with staying here especially with the location. Well other than the location, I have to say for a Hyatt we were disappointed. To begin with we upgraded our room to get a water view with a bacolony. Being a member and having the app it allows you to upgrade the day or two before your reservation. Well, our room was ready early but it wasn't the right room we paid extra for. üòí it was a water view from the side of the building (oh I see what they did there that's sneaky) but where is my damn balcony. To make matters worse every time I went down to deal with it at the front desk there was a huge line and only 1-2 people working the front desk ... Which seems a little short staffed considering its such a huge hotel on the weekends. I would always just give up and resolve to come back later. A couple times I tried calling on the phone and no one would even answer the phone just pick up the phone and hang it up. üò°. The major problem we had was the Valet service. SLOW, SLOW, SLOW. Again, because they are often parking your cars off site (we were told this by the actual staff) they DON'T have ENOUGH PEOPLE WORKING. I had read the reviews and peioke griping about the valet so I told me husband hey call about 20-30 min before we need our car. We would get the phone call to our room ""please proceed down to valet your car will be ready in 5 min"" and THEN STILL WAIT ANOTHER 15-20 MIN. This is ABSOLUTELY unacceptable especially when they are charging you $30/night and MANY other hotels in the city that are just as expensive are free or not nearly the cost. I dont mind paying, don't get me wrong I actually love the convenience of valet.... But DAMN you better get that service locked down because it is making your hotel look like ammature hour! Just because the inside is nice and reflects a Hyatt chain doesn't mean you can SKIMP on customer service because the word will get out and the Hyatt Brand will come calling.

"Absolutely wonderful hotel.

We stayed here for a drive from FL to Atlanta, and wanted a change of scenery instead of going up I75 again.

It's in an perfect location, on site valet parking is a bit pricey, but the Whitaker Street garage is a very short walk to the hotel and much cheaper to park at.

Walking along the river is quite nice too. Watching the ships is quite cool.

The sun deck on the 7th floor give a nice view of downtown Savannah, and the Garden Terrace on the 4th floor has a great view of the river with comfortable and quiet seating.

When we arrived we saw many signs for the Georgia Association of Realtors, so we were a little worried it'd be noisy, but it is dead silent in the room.

This is by far the quietest hotel room I've ever been in. In the hallway is quite a bit noisier, but in your room it's literally silent.

Even with someone above you, you can't hear them take a shower unless you are in the bathroom deliberately trying to hear it. It's fantasticly quiet.

The bathroom is fairly small, I will agree with those reviews, but it's not unreasonable at all.

In my opinion the only thing that gives away how old this hotel is are the elevators. They look so incredibly dated it's hilarious. The boxy glass elevators are in desperate need of modernization. One of the 3 are out of service for updates, but who knows when that will be done. There's enough reviews on here saying it's been in progress for a while. Only having two elevators was not a hindrance at all though.

The bar was pretty nice too, and the outdoor seating area has a great view of the river. I'd totally recommend the River Street Rendezvous cocktail. It's excellent if you like rum and pineapple juice.

Overall, I'd definitely stay here again. Hyatt continues to deliver on their legendary quality.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpd2ZyUnhnRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hyatt+Regency+Savannah/@32.9613127,-91.8300175,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88fb9e6410b40f99:0x27d1b05532b0a2e7!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d32.0815354!4d-81.0914177!16s%2Fg%2F1vzg32h5?hl=en",ChIJmQ-0EGSe-4gR56KwMlWw0Sc,Hotel,5.0,Hyatt Regency Savannah,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjROC5xbZiq9hMhp0f6hccOz8cU6deKB503kcT=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

Also, when the Hyatt's computers went down, they were still able to handle and help customers. Really impressed with the level of care and the helpfulness. The valet was also pretty good.

We also used a meeting room that was staffed by food service workers and hotel management, and this was an interesting situation because the first day we were there they took excellent care of us.  The second and third days of meetings, our service was noticeably dropping off. Staff on the first day were well aware of our dietary restrictions in the group and were very detailed to make sure everything was correct. Not so in following days. The last day they basically disappeared after lunch, zero dessert options or drink refills, and we did not see hotel staff again until the end of the day.

"This was our first weekend away from our 5 children in over 2 years and the Eden Resort and Suites did not disappoint. From the welcoming atmosphere, cleanliness, and phenomenal staff we will definitely make this our first choice for another staycation. The staff was accommodating and courteous.  While walking down the hall to my brother and sister-in-law's room carrying her birthday gifts a staff member in front of us turned around and asked if we needed assistance carrying anything.  The room was spacious and comfortable and we loved the adults-only floor. We all actually decided to not go out and do an activity but stayed in the room and had beverages and played cards till after 2 AM. A big plus is where our room was and the ""J"" entrance we were a mere 100 steps to the Sheetz :) The only complaint we have is with the pool. We have no problem and understand the booking of time slots to ensure everyone's safety I wish it was open later for adults. Most places we have visited only allow adults after 10 PM.  It was kind of hard to enjoy the hot tub. Otherwise, I really have no complaints at all.

"Overall, we had a good stay. Came here with my sisters, mother, and nieces for a girls night out. The room was clean and comfortable but a bit dated. Staff were friendly and helpful during our stay.

The pool was heated, but it was still cold in my opinion. They ran out of towels when I had arrived to the pool so I had to wait until I was ready to leave and they had just restocked the towels. The playground was small, but nice. The basketball court was also nice. The table tennis could have been maintained better, the net was broken so was the 1 paddle that was at the table. While I was there the restaurant was closed for renovations. So were unable to get room service despite the front desk telling me the other restaurant was opened, but I was unable to get connected to that restaurant.

"We stayed for an overnight stay this past weekend and had a wonderful time! We were in a poolside room which had a door right into the indoor pool. This was so nice to be able to walk right out, swim, and head right back into our room. The room was clean and comfortable and had plenty of space. The outdoor pool is a good size and has plenty of seating available. We used the mobile app for check-in, check-out, and the key to our room which worked great and it was so nice to not have to go to the front desk for anything.

We explored the hotel and the event rooms were so beautiful. The location isn't directly near much, but it is pretty close to downtown Lancaster which had some great restaurants and shopping.

The main issue I think worth noting is that the wifi in the hotel, at least in our room, was basically unusable. We had to use mobile data to use the internet and the app for our room key.

"We came to Lancaster to enjoy the New Year. We stayed in the King Villas. The room itself was beautiful. The bathroom could have used some updating. Also the  kitchenware needed better cleaning, but nice nonetheless. The real issue with my stay and why I would never decide to visit again was the customer service and my personal property. I stayed overnight on New Year‚Äôs Eve. I woke up in the morning to find my white car parked in the lot COVERED with confetti. My car was the only one within that lot covered. I was understandably upset, and wanted to rectify the situation. I called the front desk and explained the issue. I understand it was not the hotel, but rather other guests and my personal property is not the responsibility of the resort. Where is the accountability for the guests they house? They offered minimal help or care. The most they could offer to assist was windex and paper towels or filing a police report.

Absolutely loved our experience! Our daughter had requested a night at a hotel with a swimming pool for her birthday. We had made mention of this to staff when booking and asked for a ballon in the room as something special. Staff went above and beyond by including some snacks for her as well as a card in addition to the ballon. Needless to say our 4 yr old freaked out when she saw it. Thank you so much to the staff that made our night special for our girl! We got a poolside room and so we were able to make the most of our time swimming. Our room was spacious and clean.

"Been coming here for years, beautiful hotel, great salt water indoor pool & spa. Heated outdoor pool open until end of October. Also outside has small playground, basketball, pool table, ping pong table, shuffle board & bocce. Reasons for 3 stars, 1. had absolutely no WiFi the entire 4 days their in our room. It was located poolside by the indoor pool. WiFi worked outside of room & in lobby though. Spoke to front desk twice, & they said they didn‚Äôt need to come to the b/c router was outside of room. Was texting with someone & they gave me the password to another WiFi, but that didn‚Äôt work in the room. 2. Weddings all weekend so very hard to get a parking spot at night. Rooms lack USB ports to charge devices. No more free coffee in lobby. Gave a card now for towels, 1 towel per card, if you don‚Äôt turn card back in $25 charge, see pic.

"We checked in today and so far this place has exceeded our expectations. Staff has been incredibly friendly and helpful. We checked into on of the suites snd recived a text from. The concierges to help us with anything we needed. We texted them a few times to get some information and they were very prompt, helpful and really nice. The room is wonderful, very clean  and modern. See pics. Were going to us the heated pool , hot tub and will try the on site restaurant, will update our review post.
Update, we did goto the indoor pool and it was enchanting. Indoor heated pool was great. You get cards for towel service when you check in and get a fresh towel when you arrive to the pool. The jacuzzi was corded off due to maintenance. While that was dissapointing for our evening I greatly appreciated thier concern for guests safety.
We also had dinner at the restaurant and that was incredible. They have this seafood dish with a tomato broth that was divine. Everyone in our party raved about thier food.
Breakfast, we would advise to skip the buffet, it was not up to the rest of the standards. Pastries were days old, the hot fares were mediocre.  The fruit was nice but that was not worth the price. So I would suggest breakfast offsite and there close places to choose from.

"We stayed here over the Thanksgiving weekend to visit family.  We had a room right off the pool so our grandchildren could come visit and spend time swimming. It has a tropical atmosphere and a hot tub. The door to the pool is locked from the outside at night and there is an alarm that alerts you if someone opens the door from the room. This is great for safety for families with small children. The room we had was spacious with 2 queen beds. The room was clean.  I liked the vanity make up area outside the bathroom but the lighting should be more conducive to being able to see better. This hotel has a bar off the dining room and the dining room had certain hours of operation...which is ok as I like the option to eat in the dining room instead of going out.There was a convenience store which carried lots of goodies including great coffee from Lancaster County. I really like the classic charm throughout this whole resort and the  service of the staff was
superior throughout.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is the comfort of the bed. We woke up each morning with backaches. Maybe mattresses should be upgraded ü§î.

"This place doesn‚Äôt look like much when you pull up, but once inside you can tell that they take pride in this hotel.
Everything in the lobby was very clean, neat and orderly. It looked like this place had been remodeled recently.
The breakfast and sitting area are located right off of the main entrance across from the lobby.
It too was very clean and neat.
I stopped here for one night on my return trip home from Florida.
I always choose a Best Western because the rooms are very clean, they give you complimentary toiletries, blow dryer, iron and ironing board, a coffee pot and free coffee in your room. You also get a refrigerator and microwave in your room and free WiFi.
I always try to get a king size bedroom. The beds are super comfortable, and I‚Äôm able to get a good nights sleep.
With my room came with a complimentary breakfast. This is standard with most Best Westerns.
This Smithville Best Western has an indoor pool which is permanently closed and a gym. I did not use them.
For breakfast they serve scrambled eggs, ham or bacon, grits, homemade waffles, that you make yourself. Cold cereal, oatmeal, fresh fruit, yogurt, biscuits and sausage gravy, bagels, toast, muffins, pastries, coffee, tea, juices, or milk. You can have as much as you want. The breakfast is constantly replenished by a sweet older lady.
Checkin was very easy. The front desk staff was extremely nice, and made some recommendations when we asked. They have a free parking lot.

"For as much money as I paid, and how high scale they make the hotel look/seem, im very disappointed and will not be booking here again. Upon walking in and inspecting my room, there were crumbs and dirt everywhere. Nice to know they dont sweep or vacuum in between guests. I stayed two nights, and found myself having to go to the restaurants in the casino for more to drink than the two complimentary mini bottles of water they give you, and one bottle of ginger ale was 5 dollars. I guess i should‚Äôve expected nothing less, but the food and restaurants all seemed the same. The food they offer at luckies you can find at orchid kitchen which is also the envivo restaurant in one. I expected since the restaurants are listed as separate entities that they would be separate but its not. I was looking forward to staying here but I am extremely disappointed. Imagine cutting into a beautiful extravagant looking cake just to find out its made out of rice krispie treats. That‚Äôs exactly what staying here was like, i‚Äôve stayed at cleaner hotels that were cheaper than this. Even the complimentary toiletries were dirty looking.

"This review is about the hotel itself. Big pluses it's location (less than 40 minutes drive from DC) and direct connection to the casino and just 3 minutes walk to the center of the shopping mall. The room decor is pretty nice, they are clean and have ample of amenities (supplemental coffee, towels and so on). The staff is attentive (some reviews mentioned that staff were rude - nothing like that here). Check in and check out was a breeze. So, why 4 stars? I get used to having minibar - here a fridge but no drinks. Also a little bit late check in time - past 3PM. Overall it was a darn good time. And finally couple technical details - hotel charges around $15 resort fee (worth it - the spa is nice) and it's $150 hold for accidental fee (some people counted it as ""erroneous charge"".",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvcXZTMGNBEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Live!+Casino+%26+Hotel+Maryland/@35.8076728,-90.2479862,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89b7e3e744d116a9:0xa87434c1ecc1bc43!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.1577546!4d-76.7268883!16s%2Fm%2F0gmdn3v?hl=en",ChIJqRbRROfjt4kRQ7zB7ME0dKg,Casino,4.0,Live!

"We were visiting from out of town and we wanted to try out a new restaurant and check out a casino for the first time so we went here (we also ended up checking out Horseshoe Casino on another night and I would prefer Live! over Horseshoe if I gambled since it was more crowded and more tables going on at Live!). The main reason we visited was I have seen Bobby Flay on the cooking channel so wanted to try out his burger palace.
We did not gamble but we walked around the casino before and after dinner at BBP. This casino is also a hotel. A 4-star hotel. It is located in Hanover which really worked out for us since it is right next to the largest mall in Maryland - Arundel Mills. Quick walk from the mall to the casino.
We saw hundreds of slot machines and some table games going on like blackjack, poker, roulette, craps, etc. and playing the slots and table games range from 1 cent to a couple hundred dollars as far as what you can bet per slot or table. They did have a high betting area as well. I think it was at least $50 each bet but not 100% sure; we did not walk in there. In the main casino area, I saw video themed slots from dragons, anime, Simpsons, etc. Musicians and bands come here to perform such as Gladys Knight and Dwight Yoakam so check it out if you are in the area and want to go to a special event.
The bathrooms in the casino were clean. Everything was stocked with toilet paper, soap, paper towels, etc.
There are other restaurants/places to eat at that have American, Asian, seafood, and Italian dishes. There are a lot of casual places and a fine dining option. Go to the casino website to check out those options. There are TVs in this casino to watch sports on such as Sportscenter, baseball games, football games, etc. They had a Live! Casino gift shop as well. We didn't walk in there but it was big enough to get a souvenir with their logo on it, cigarettes, snacks, or whatever you wanted from there.
There was plenty of free parking. They also offer valet parking.
It was cool to go to a casino and have that experience but I am not sure we will be back again unless we were with a group of people who wanted to go or we chose to try out one of the other restaurants.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwOGJMMV9RRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Live!+Casino+%26+Hotel+Maryland/@35.8076728,-90.2479862,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89b7e3e744d116a9:0xa87434c1ecc1bc43!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.1577546!4d-76.7268883!16s%2Fm%2F0gmdn3v?hl=en",ChIJqRbRROfjt4kRQ7zB7ME0dKg,Casino,4.0,Live!

Hotel staff was very nice. The bathrooms were staffed with people for the conference area and were kept exceptionally clean‚Ä¶ I mean SPOTLESS! Overall, it‚Äôs an OK hotel but needed more staff. We were there for 6 days and wasn‚Äôt able to get a cart for the luggage when we arrived or left.
The location of the hotel seems good considering the proximity to BWI airport. You have to walk through the Casino to get to more food and the choices are slim. Vegetarian options were a negative. Some of the casino staff wouldn‚Äôt let you bring outside food back through the casino. You go up 3 floors, through the garage, and back down on the other side.

"The newly open LIVE! Casino & Hotel. I booked this for a one night staycation and wanted to give it a shot.

We knew construction was still ongoing, so finding the entrance from the garage was a bit confusing but the best level to park on was P1 on the far side away from the Casino itself because this took you to the backside of the Casino which is where they have the new entrance for the Hotel. The moment you walk in to the hallway, you see the Gelato place and the gift shop all next to David's (the hotel restaurant). You honestly forget you were in the Live! Casino itself just a few seconds ago. The check-in staff was very attentive and helpful in finding our reservations and getting us on our way; the only bad part was I expected a $20 free play but because I had already gotten this credit a few years ago, they didn't give it to me.

We had our unit on the 8th floor for a King Suite with a bathtub and shower. It was a very spacious master suite, with a huge bathroom. The toilet and shower each had a separate glass door unit with a double vanity. The room had huge fantastic glass windows with a view to the Costco, still cool overall. The downside was the sound-proof of the room; we heard the planes outside since we were on the BWI runway side and also housekeeping having large conversations in the hallway sounded like they were inside our own room. I also was disappointed that they did not give hand soap (at least the little bars) for you to use. Also, the pillows were not what I expected in a luxury suite, not that comfortable.

The Keurig coffee machine was a nice plus to have in the room, along with an iron and ironing board. The attention to detail in having robes was also nice; the large screen TV was great (w/ plenty of channels and ability to link with your streaming apps). The nice touch of having a touch pad with your name was cool; it also has a built-in app for white noise which was helpful. Finally, having a couch (not that comfy), coffee table and office desk were nice pluses.

In regard to the Spa and Fitness center, we went down to see the Fitness center and overall were impressed with the equipment (mainly aerobics, but nice smith machines, kettle and dumbbells). We didn't see inside the Spa area but it looked very spacious. Otherwise, we went down to the Casino itself and played.

For the price we paid for a King suite, we expected a bit more (ie. some extras included).

"La Creme is a chic creperie located on Main St in Zeeland. The space is bright and airy which makes for the absolute cutest place to have brunch!!

The wonderful thing about La Creme is that they have both sweet AND savory crepes!! If you wouldn‚Äôt call yourself a sweet tooth, then you are in luck because their menu includes some crazy amazing savory crepe options!

Their savory crepes are also naturally gluten-free: BONUS!

And it is SO FUN to watch them make the crepes as they add in all of the yum that it‚Äôs filled with and then fold it into a delicious MASTERPIECE üí´

Because I meannnn do you SEE how beautiful those are?! ü§©

While their main focus is crepes, La Creme also offers everything from yogurt bowls to smoothies to coffee to boba to macaroons to pastries and EVEN MORE!!

"You can consider LA CREME your go-to spot for small batch, organic artisan crepes. The Canela and Citron crepes are our favorites. Make sure to order them with strawberries.

The difference, as with most great restaurants, starts with using excellent ingredients. When we spoke to Kim, the owner of LA CREME, she explained that their toppings are either made in-house or sourced from high quality bakers and such is the whipped cream ‚Äî a delicious level of thickness with the right amount of sweet.

You can feel the attention to details in the decor. It‚Äôs down to earth with an elegant use of black and white with splashes of rose gold among the perfectly socially-distanced tables.

The staff is young, precise, and welcoming.

Overall a great experience that can rival those in Napa, where we‚Äôve been going for years.

The waitress clearly saw that I only took one small bite of my burger and never even questioned whether I liked it or not or if they could remake it. Still charged me full price & that was truly disappointing. Basic customer service adequate, would be to ask the customer if they enjoyed their food or how things were? But she clearly she did not.

"My wife and I stopped here for lunch following a trip to Chriskindlemart.

We were quickly greeted by the hostess and or waitress Kim came over to us to take our order relatively quickly. She greeted us with a smile in a very friendly manner.

We both ordered the strawberry lemonade which is a great thirst quencher. For appetizers,  we shared the crab dip and brown butter buffalo wings which were delicious.

For meals, my wife had the crab cakes with brussel sprouts and the bacon twice baked potato. She said the crab cakes were very good but said the brussel sprouts,  although extremely tasty and flavorful,  were not fully cooked and were somewhat hard. She also said the twice baked potato filling was very good, but the skin of the potato was very hard and overcooked.

I had the butter garlic strip steak medium well with the broccoli, potato wedges and the stuffed potato.

The steak was served already sliced, and although not a huge problem, not something that I prefer. It was slightly over cooked. To me, medium well it's slightly pink in the center (serving temp around 160*) but it was cooked well done. Also, the menu says roasted garlic and herb butter. I didn't sense any butter on it and it came with quartered garlic on top. The wedges were very tasty and seasoned nicely as was the stuffed potato.

For dessert we had the funnel cake fried Oreo's which was delicious!

The presentation of all the food was exceptional. The cleanliness of the restaurant was superb. There wasn't a time when we didn't see someone cleaning.

Lastly, the food was not very expensive for the portions.

"After passing this restaurant numerous times my hubby and I   decided it was finally time to give it a try.  Well...we were not disappointed! We began our meal with the fried mozzarella which was highly recommended by both the hostess and our server.  Excellent and not your typical...these were huge and there were five of them..more like logs as they're referred to by staff! And marinara dipping sauce was really good...just a slight kick to it.  Hubby then had  a crabcake and shrimp and chicken fajitas (he couldn't decide between the two as entr√©es so getting the crabcake as an add on worked out great!)...and I had the yummy strawberry apple walnut salad with chicken.

"We stayed here last week in the King Suite. The room was 5 stars without a doubt. The hotel itself wasn't too bad either. The only complaint I have is the smell of cigarette smoke right when you walk in which is coming from the casino. The restaurants are overpriced and aren't that great. However, the food from room service is extremely good and reasonably priced. We ended up getting snowed in which was a bit of a bummer for our trip. Unfortunately due to the storm the tvs weren't working either. Luckily we were leaving the next day so it wasn't too bad.

I'm not a fan of casinos but went to visit one of the restaurants and play a few dollars in the slots.  We always set an amount that we're willing to pay for a few hours of entertainment and that's all we spend.  It's our own game of how long will it take to lose this amount to the house.  In this case it was not nearly as much fun as it use to be.  The slots are 100% video games and everyone in our group felt like we were just spectators watching the games play themselves with our money.  Give me a handle to pull or something that makes me feel like I'm more involved otherwise I might as well just stay home and watch TV.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcDlQWXZ3RRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mount+Airy+Casino+Resort/@37.5346621,-86.6444706,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89c48d2f05e529b1:0x7f37e8a22bad11cb!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d41.113512!4d-75.321688!16s%2Fm%2F05215w6?hl=en",ChIJsSnlBS-NxIkRyxGtK6LoN38,Casino,3.0,Mount Airy Casino Resort,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_6YVJg1zw3broZ2xTCULMDounznz2VFdwn_Ig=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

It's an adventure, and the table games are second to none.

"Place is very nice. Rooms are all updated and very clean. Would have given it 5 stars but....

Took forever to get our rooms.

Food selections are very limited. Food staff seems very disorganized and it takes a long time to get served even when it is empty. But food was very good once it arrived, a half hour later.

No live music or bar/entertainment venues. Not like the Hard Rock Casinos.  It is basically just a Casino.

Pool is very crowded and open to outside guests, non-hotel guests, therefore they take all the seats and nothing is left for hotel guests. Very strange policy, and they yell at you if you sit in the coach area. What are you to do when there are no other seats available. Very odd.

"Absolutely recommend this resort! Beautiful decor and VERY friendly staff. Our room, a suite, was appropriately sized and fun to be in, also was able to check in 1.5 hours early so that was also very sweet to the price deal. The pool i recommend going early if enjoying adults only type of time, by 2-3pm lots of kiddos around. Bistecca was SUPER delicious and wait staff was very friendly and attentive. The live band playing last night 8/12 was jamming pretty well, i didnt stick around to give a full listen though. The cabanas were amazing to utilize, you also get to use the pool before/after checkout so thats a plus. Only gripes would be: unless you valet, theres no separate parking for the hotel, so you either walk thru the casino(which is probably designed on purpose) or walk around the outside, about a 5 min walk. Also, be prepared if going/leaving during peak times as your mixed in with regular casino goers so you may end up in the back of the lot. Secondly, theres not a lot of communication; in terms of staff to staff and promoting. Know before you go, the ONLY place to ACTUALLY get breakfast is Fieri's kitchen (other pption is a starbucks) unless you pay attention to the changing directory sign, you have no indication thats it for breakfast. Thirdly, the buffet opens an hour AFTER checkout, again, breakfast is the cheapest meal to execute so dropping the ball there too.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cE92Ql9nRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mount+Airy+Casino+Resort/@37.5346621,-86.6444706,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89c48d2f05e529b1:0x7f37e8a22bad11cb!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d41.113512!4d-75.321688!16s%2Fm%2F05215w6?hl=en",ChIJsSnlBS-NxIkRyxGtK6LoN38,Casino,4.0,Mount Airy Casino Resort,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIhaPOVH5-c94OAgasZ0aoXCVQj1GlbsLpwGeB=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel
"This place is great, they are top notch clean and professional.  Very attentive and polite. The beds are comfortable and you cant get excess to the hotel rooms from the elevator without a key. You will need it for the elevator to move. The pool was nice and big with options to go outside or stay inside. The only thing is there is no hot tub which is what I was looking for.  They have about 4 restaurants onsite and a casino all in the same location. We went to the buffet which h coat about 16.99 a person. Food and desert was really good. Drinks are included in that price. They have a guys burger which was really good.we got to the hotel early and there no hesitation to allow us to have our room early.  It was cleaned amd ready. They dont really have a walking trail which is what I was looking for giving the location and the beautiful views here. This hotel has high glass decorations all over bery detailed amd beautiful I really enjoyed. They had a bar are at the pool which is were you would get your towels.

"Got an awesome deal from Groupon for 1 night. We arrived at 6pm, free valet, were quickly checked in, and down enjoying the pool by 7pm where we wound down with a drink and a swim. Afterwards we showered, had some delicious appetizers at Guy Fieri‚Äôs then hit the casino floor  for a few hours before calling it a night. The beds are so comfy I didn‚Äôt feel my partner move all night. We just woke up and had an amazing breakfast at GF‚Äôs and are packing up before heading back down to enjoy the pool for a couple more hours before we hit the road for our next destination.
Few complaints: the parking. Your options are valet and waiting or self-parking outside the casino and making the trek up to your room. It is a bit slow moving process if you choose valet. Also, the mini fridges are packed with items that will get charged to your room if removed. They don‚Äôt leave you any space for you own items that need to be refrigerated.

"Peaceful place to stay, rooms are a little stuffy no matter how much you adjust the thermostat, it does not work. Gorgeous scenery. The rooms are nice and clean, and the staff is friendly however, for the amount of money charged for the stay the in room amenities could be much better. There's a wet bar as well as snacks such as nuts, pretzels, etc. DO NOT TOUCH them because you will be charged significantly! Don't even accidentally knock over a can of pretzels or you will be charged as it is weight sensitive. There is no microwave or refrigerator for personal use. You can rent a refrigerator for $26.50 per day. I believe that there is an option to rent the microwave as well. When checking out there are several additional charges such as a $12 food charge, $27.75 beverage charge, a $75 service charge, and another charge for $75 that says other. None of these charges were discussed prior to or during check in. It's evident that this place is about getting their money but, my husband and I enjoyed ourselves.

"Valet free. Shout out to Lisa. Super friendly and helpful upon arrival and departure.
Stayed at hotel. Room was very nice and clean. Bed and pillows comfortable.
Small casino, but it has all the games- slot and table.
Guy Fieri was good for lunch and breakfast. No reservations. Servers friendly. Food was good.
Bisteka restaurant was nice. Need reservations. People dressed nice.. Make sure to tell server 1/2 or full plate. The half was enough. The calamari was excellent! Lightly breaded. Two free small glasses of champagne for my daughter's birthday!
Noodle place was awesome as well. No reservations. See bento box photo. Server was very nice.

"Small casino compared to other ones I‚Äôve been to (Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods). We stayed for a night in the Center Suite as a mini getaway from home.

They allowed us to check-in early, which was nice, especially since my husband wanted to take my toddler to the pool. Toddler had fun in the pool, but besides that there wasn‚Äôt much to do for the little one.
Ate dinner at one of the restaurants on the casino floor and then spent rest of the evening in the room watching tv (not much option). Ordered room service for breakfast the next day before we went home. There was nothing special about it and coffee had a horrible cleaning supply taste to it. Pretty expensive especially since 18% gratuity was included in the room service bill

"After a few years of renting boats from a local competitor that always had issues (non existent bimini, broken gas gauge, engine that was leaking gas, dirty and old boats, etc), i decided to try a new rental place.

I rented the 18 foot 150hp Bowrider.  There were no massive issues like before.  The boat was clean, fast, and fun.  The stereo didn't work but we had a wireless water proof speaker for this anyways.  We rented for 3 days and came back once for a fuel up in between.

The only downside was that we hit an underwater log in the middle of the lake.  They showed me the damage to the skeg and as I had taken a pic of the prop/skeg before the rental, it was undeniable.  Got hit with a $350 charge for repair, but I can't blame Yankee as this is part of the risk of boating.

"I was so impressed with Perdido Beach Resort at our recent conference. All of the staff went above and beyond to meet our needs and facilitate the conference. Front desk staff,  catering/restaurant staff, maid service staff were all excellent.  My hotel room was beautiful, clean and comfortable.  The complimentary valet parking was so appreciated upon arrival! The food at all meals was wonderful.  The lobby, with live music in the evenings, was such a pleasure.
Looking forward to returning.
One suggestion I would make is to get rid of the plastic table attached to the balcony railing in the ocean-front rooms. It obscures the view - not so much when you're standing in the doorway, but when you're seated in the room, it really blocks the view. And, while I see the benefit of the bar-height stools on the balcony, for enhanced viewing while on the balcony, they are very uncomfortable after about 5 minutes.  I have a bad back.  I called the desk to request a regular height chair for the balcony, but none were available.  I ended up buying a chair to use on the balcony - left it in the room, as I didn't have room to take it with me.  If you're planning to replace the rest of the balcony chairs with the plastic bar table and bar stool chairs, please reconsider - maybe offer both, or have some regular chairs available, upon request. If you've already committed to installing the balcony bar table, please consider moving it to the edge of the balcony so it doesn't obstruct the view so much from within the room. One small suggestion in a wonderful stay.
There was a very long wait (45 minutes) on the phone to make a reservation. We had to phone in to get the conference rate. Once I reached a reservationist, everything was great.

"As a local from Baldwin County, the Perdido Beach Resort is a great option for anyone wanting to spend some time at the beach! It could be challenging to someone not familiar with Orange Beach to decide where to stay, but this place will not disappoint!

Situated just west of Alabama Point at the bridge, the PB Resort is located near The Gulf, a great casual dining option, plus other dining options across the street and nearby. The famous Flora-Bama is just a short drive east!

The PB Resort offers ample parking, but it does fill up quickly. On-site valet is also available. To enter the hotel, you can walk up the side-facing stairs leading from the parking below or remain on the lower level and follow the sidewalk around beneath the upper level.

Upon checking in, we received elastic wristbands that were our room key. Definitely an easy way to keep up with your key instead of always fumbling around in pockets, etc.

Our room was very clean! There was no carpet in our room, just vinyl plank style flooring. A nice upgrade from gross hotel carpet you often find nowadays. We had a small balcony with a bar height table & chairs, that offered a great side view, West facing both the Gulf & the adjacent cove area/ Robinson Island across the street.

The outside bar/patio offers great drinks & food! I thought it was interesting that each time I ordered a Mango Margarita, I got something different but still tasty lol. Bartenders were friendly and quick! Food was also good.

The pool & surrounding grounds are great & create a nice relaxing atmosphere. There was also live music on the days we were there.

Voyagers, one of the many restaurants inside is great! Perfect for date night, or any other celebration.

Really love this hotel! Great for families and everyone visiting Orange Beach!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc3J1MU13EAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Perdido+Beach+Resort/@31.9788356,-97.5429081,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x889a070af414aab9:0x44d9126e8d835330!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d30.273649!4d-87.561467!16s%2Fg%2F1tj2p783?hl=en",ChIJuaoU9AoHmogRMFODjW4S2UQ,Hotel,5.0,Perdido Beach Resort,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlGKI3k_rd4Ha4Izi6jArgc8D23Nw3sNpv0HCz=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"When I called to make arrangements with them. I told them what I wanted/expected and they delivered. I believe that we had the best room in the whole resort. I love the fact that everything is right there. We drove in instead of flying so after 12 hours we didn't want to be in the car any longer. They have everything. Your food, alchohol, and if u forgot anything from home, there is a good chance the gift shop has it.

The restaurants available had some amazing food. Not a huge pizza fan but the pizzeria is really good.

Oh and did I mention you can take your alchohol anywhere?  We loved that. You can bring your own or choose from a couple of different bars on site. One of the staff told us only rule was no glass outside. So if you choose to bring your own, make sure u buy cans or aluminum bottles. Also allow coolers on the beach but not in the pool area.

Special thank you to Don and Kadine who cleaned our room prior to our visit and left their card. The room has plenty of charging stations even one if you forgot to bring the wall block and wire. Wifi and valet are complementary. Additionally, it is maintained well as we constantly saw the friendly staff working. Voyagers (the fine dining restaurant), Latitude 30, a pizza place ? Name with Icees and Hershey‚Äôs ice cream, and an outdoor bar and grill are all on site. They were all delicious (and great service). The rooms are not cleaned until after checkout unless a guest requests cleaning. Any extra towels or other necessities are available upon request.

"Perdido Beach Resort starts first with the wonderful people who run the hotel like Susan Newsom who made sure our stay for our 38th anniversary was PERFECT.  The rooms are clean and quiet and the breakfast this morning was fast and the omelet chef made a creation that Wolfgang Puck would be proud to share.   If you want a great place to enjoy the beach with wonderful people to take care of you book now.

Update.

The last night we decided to dine at Voyager's.  Eddie got us the perfect window table and the cuisine is the best on the coast from Pensacola to Orange beach you won't find a better view or better service or better steaks.  Save room for dessert.  I do recommend reservations.

"It's a pretty nice place. Very convenient to have shops and restaurants on site. Beach access right off the pool is great. The beach is very well taken care of.

The chairs and umbrellas on the beach are for rent. We got out there early and we weren't away of that so we were told nicely to move our stuff. We didn't rent from them as we had our own things but the option is great.

The pool is a pretty big size. It was too cold for us enjoy it though but so was the beach. We went 5/23-5/27. It's not a heated pool. Wish it was and we could have enjoyed it. The temperature when we went was high 70s, 14mph winds and felt amazing outside of the water. If the pool was heated, it would have been amazing. The kiddie pool is also nice but also not heated.

We stayed in room 601 and Our room was nice, room service and house keeping were great. We didn't have enough towels or know how to turn on the shower on but we called house keeping and they were there in seconds with more towels and shower us the shower. (You just pull down on a fixture directly under faucet lol and to turn it off, you just shut the water off. I felt a little dumb haha) Our room had a fridge but no microwave. Beds are super comfy. But oh!!! The sliding door had me about to rip it out. The sliding balcony door has a frame that is above the floor. I stubbed my toe on that frame at least 15 times while I was there and by the last time I did it I wanted to rip out that door. My daughter also stubbed her toe a few times and cried every time. It hurts! So beware of that door. Not sure if all the rooms are like that but 601, yes. I warned you.

Breakfast buffet was super good! Definitely give it a go. Priced well too. The pizza downstairs is also really... Really good!

This was our first time to Orange Beach/Gulf shores and it was nice. If you plan on chilling on the beach of resort the whole time, I would recommend this place. We didn't find much else to do here. Yeah there's a park and The Track is pretty cool but I was expecting to see a bunch of restaurants and activities. None of that here. It's nothing compared to Destin which is just 90 min away but if I go back, and the price is right, I'll stay at this resort again.

Staff was super friendly and helpful.

"I stayed here for the NENA conference last year, and I'd heard only negative things about the hotel.  I'm happy to say they were wrong!

The hotel underwent a renovation at some point in the last few years so the rooms are more modern.  From what my co-worker said it ""used to look like a dump"".  There are some issues with quality of the rooms where it looks like a flipper did them.  An example is the shower doors where they will slide open on their own.  My room as well as my co-worker had this issue.

The pool is very large with a nice bar and a window to order food and drinks from while outside.  There is also a clear walking path to the beach.  There is an inside and outside pool area.  The inside area has a hot tub and a little area for swimming inside (it's connected to the main pool, so if it storms - you'll need to get out).  The inside area is slippery, so watch your footing and DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS RUN.  The main large pool has a walk over bridge and a gazebo where live music was played every day I was there.

If you want food, they have two restaurants that serve dinner (one casual and one fancy), but they are a little pricey.  The fancier option you'll need to make a reservation for as they are small and don't have space for walk ins.  There is also a little cafe that is open in the mornings with coffee and muffins.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aGFlZlhREAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Perdido+Beach+Resort/@31.9788356,-97.5429081,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x889a070af414aab9:0x44d9126e8d835330!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d30.273649!4d-87.561467!16s%2Fg%2F1tj2p783?hl=en",ChIJuaoU9AoHmogRMFODjW4S2UQ,Hotel,5.0,Perdido Beach Resort,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxh6GNdN_9RrghyVOEex5lKO2MeYagacVC_Elj=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"My mother in law, sister in law, and I took a short girls trip (my 3yr old son also tagged along) & spent 2 nights here and LOVED it. Everyone was extremely friendly. We enjoyed the pier that led to the private beach. It lit up at night, which was nice. I had wished that for the amount of money we were spending on the room, at least breakfast would be included. That and the fact that the separate 2ft kiddie pool was not well lit at night, no lights around it at all, are the only reasons I am giving less than 5 stars. However, although a bit pricy, I can say that the breakfast buffet was VERY good. The servers were great. I would definitely recommend having dinner at Cotton's up the road also!

Our stay was primo at this resort. Nothing outrageously fancy but everything we could ask for in a weekend impromptu beach visit.

"Very economical. This sampler I got had 4 different things on it using a big plate. For $3 more, you get a salad and drink. All said and done, about $12 for everything, and it was a ton of food. Service was great. Food was prepared quickly, very friendly people, and attentive to check up on you. Bread sticks (when dining in) are unlimited, and they come hot and fresh, buttered and seasoned with garlic. They are super soft and fluffy. Honestly, I rate their breadsticks above Olive Gardens. They are wonderful. Reasons why I‚Äôm not going with 5 stars, is nothing that this location has control over. It‚Äôs not a complaint of the individual location itself. First issue is, I felt the Alfredo sauce was very bland. I‚Äôve had stuff out of a jar at home that beats it. Secondly, the amount of sauce (all 3 pastas had the same issue) they put on is very little compared to the noodles you get. My feeling is, I can buy a pound of uncooked noodles for $1 at the store. After they absorb the water, you‚Äôve got 2lbs of noodles for $1. Commercially, they buy them much cheaper than that even. Noodles are incredibly cheap. Yet, you‚Äôre not really given enough sauce for them. Since pasta is so cheap, you‚Äôd think they could afford another 50 cents of sauce. The picture makes it look ok because it‚Äôs all on the top. It certainly looks like a decent amount of sauce. But you can‚Äôt see the noodle to sauce ratio. Also, I assume they have a pre-specified ladle size they are told to use. However, mix things up (or eat the top portion), and you‚Äôll quickly find yourself eating plain noodles. Again, I‚Äôm sure this is a corporate thing, and not location specific, but you‚Äôre reading my review because you want an honest review, right? So, I‚Äôm going to tell my experience as it was.

"I've eaten there, and now I work there. So I get to see the food ""behind the scenes"". Most, if not all, is homemade in the sense that whoever the cook is, they will cook it their own way with their own ingredients like they would in their own home. So you get to try the same food about 4 to 5 different ways which I think is pretty awesome. The cooks take allergy warnings very seriously. The owners come in pretty much every day to make sure we dont stray off of the path that they made to build this restaurant and its food upon. We have SO many return customers that when they're off work they will hang out with us from open to close. We strive to be extra friendly and helpful! And our MANY return customers can verify.  We have 2 flat screens to watch your sports on or for your child to watch cartoons so you can eat with some peace (lol). Our food is great tasting. Certain waitresses will buy 4 to 5 bowls of homemade cream of crab soup to take home for the night. As an example. So if we trust the food enough to eat it AND buy it in bulk, I'm sure you will love your dinner! Since I started working 1 month ago, I have yet to hear not even one complaint. If I work somewhere that's not all that good, I'm not afraid to say so. So I promise I'm not on here because anyone told me to, or to try to gain more customers etc. I simply rated it because my phone noticed how often I come here and asked me to review it LOL. Dont be afraid to give it a try. The portions range from ""good size for the money"" to ""Massive""! We are located inside the Laurel De Truck Stop/gas station with the Hardees hooked to it.

"Pretty decent little sandwich shop. They have hoagies, cheesesteaks, burgers, wings, and almost any other American type food. Tonight, I saw they had a great deal on Uber Eats offering buy 1 get one 1 free on select items. I decided to try the classic Philly cheesesteak, which also came with their hand cut fries (you also have the option of substituting chicken for steak).

The cheesesteak was about $12.50 each, which I think is an okay price. Portion size is decent too, not too big nor too small. I will say that there was quite a lot of bread in comparison to the meat, cheese, and vegetables. I believe the bun was too thick. The steak itself was pretty flavorful and had a good texture. They use an adequate amount of cheese. Good amount of mushrooms, and each mushroom is quite big, but they do have a slight canned flavor.

The fries were just okay. Quality probably declined due to them being in the car for delivery. Still, they were not bad, and definitely nice to get fries for free. As usual, I would have wanted a bit more salt or pepper, and they were a bit limp.

All in all, not a bad spot for a sandwich, wings, or other classic American fare. The cheesesteak was still enjoyable, just nothing special.

I'm only going to give the burgers a 2 out of 5.  The bun was double the size of the burger. The burger was dry, and the bottom of the burger was hard as if it was precooked and sitting. They didn't even ask or include any veggies for the burger.  No lettuce. No tomatoes.  No onions, and I paid 13 bux for this burger.
