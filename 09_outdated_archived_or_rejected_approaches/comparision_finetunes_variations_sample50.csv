 We went as a date night and our first breakout room experience.  Will definitely do this again!  Justin was our host and he did a great job of making sure we were all engaged and involved in figuring out the clues and breaking out of the room! Overall a great experience and great fun! , It's a great place to work your team game for fun times , Auntie was awesome. I would go again. , Very fun and challenging ,The staff were so great and my daughter and her friends had a great time!  Highly recommend!,Escape room center
 Convenient and clean! ," Movie with a girl you like, see the movie late then take her out on the executive suite and make out if you can.. "," Driving down the interstate to the Mall to get some last-minute Christmas shopping accomplished, we discovered a quaint movie theatre with TWO digital projection screens and 3 outdoor heaters. All I could think of was how much I love going to a Movie Theater! This is my ""must get-a-card-for"" situation every year.

We were pleasantly surprised to see that they offer alcohol also! On the day we went, they had bottled beer behind the ticket counter.

I highly recommend making time to check out this cinema! It was a great experience. "," Great movie theater with very comfy seating. Their food is more expensive than other places in the area, but their food is always really good and comes out hot. Ice cream is right outside the theater neat the wall windows. ",the guy at the main entrance was racist and rude he had a attitude and was looking down my shirt i am young teen and this made me very uncomfortable as a person i'm not coming back EVER!!!!,Movie theater
 this looks like an old hotel. It's not clean. it' smells like smoke in the room even it says nonsmoking! , Great place but people are super rude and obnoxious in the casino. The restaurant sucks and the outside seating sucks. ," Really great campground. The camp site was well kept, in a very pretty setting. [The RV park site is at river level]. We arrived in the late morning and  didn‚Äôt see life until late afternoon so if you need the conveniences, get there early in the day. The Tub-o-Royale on the Marketplace location is amazing. They also have a really good restaurant right on site. The only con about this campground is that it is for RVs only.  Restricted camping at an RV park.

We can say definitely a ‚Äúgo there‚Äù recommendation. Overall, a good experience at an average campground. Not sure why the price was up another $10 from what I saw online.

Kids went rock climbing‚Äìare you kidding? ", Beautiful anniversary suite! ,"If I could give negative stars, I would.  The room itself was a little sketchy with something growing on the wall, the ceiling was pealing in the corner and was breaking away along the exterior wall. The tub had serious rust stains, and the phone didn't work. That's relevant because I needed to call the front desk when I woke up and found that my car had been broken into.

I had to call on my phone and the front desk just asked what room I was in. They didn't even apologize that this crime had been committed, didn't offer to send someone to clean up the glass, call the cops, anything. And when I checked out they didn't say anything. I received more sympathy from the cops (just filed a report, they didn't send anyone out) and the glass repair company Safelite. They apologized that this had happened and helped me find a repair location that can get me in tomorrow in a different state. Quality Inn isn't quality at all. They don't care about your stay at all.",Hotel

The ambiance and decor was a delight, great service and the lemonade made it all even better. As good as life was, we had a nice dessert. ", Visiting family in Detroit. REALLY GREAT that this restaurant exists here. Our multiple orders of pitas and various dips were gone like breadcrumbs in seconds. Or placed on the table for others to eat. So glad we made the 30minute drive there to get a few minutes to enjoy it and then continue enjoying conversation with family together. , Food is great and people are nice. Will be back soon. ,Love love love the food. What an incredible price for all you can eat food. Lamb shank was just perfect. Fish was fall off the bone. Spices were just incredible.

It got pretty busy with people, and they have a great food and drink menu. Sign up for their newsletter on their website so they can send you coupons for discounts on games. That's what I did, so we saved money. I didn't order pizza, but saw someone order it, and it looks so amazingly delicious. The space you share with another group is pretty snug, though.

 Nice establishment. Lots of amenities. ," We had a really nice time for Valentine‚Äôs weekend. Warm cozy fireplace room was perfect for our little one. Also her favorite part of room was the bathroom. Bigger than other rooms we have stayed in. An even bigger plus side to this is she LOVED the floor to ceiling mirror!
We had room 729 the older kind with remodeled bath and it was well decorated and had everything we needed. Will definitely be back next year. Room remodel was done 4 years ago.
The town has now taken away the old car jumps and lowered barriers to pass over the hump. Very nice changes. We really like that there is much better lighting now for the town and walking around is much safer now.

" Comfortable shoes are a must. The lanes are well kept and there are a variety of amazing scoring options. I also like the automated ball return, it keeps things moving quickly.

absolutely wonderful experience. "," Lovely atmosphere and fantasic food!! I had the samplera and it was delicious!!
Lots of vegetarian options on menu including the sampler plate. I would certainly recommend Haadya!! "," Warm, welcoming, delicious food "," Got the stews without lamb, both were amazing.  I accidentally said it came with melon, but they didn't include any.  The only complaint is that an order of spicy extra spicy was only slightly spicy by American standards.

" This is a very nice property. The staff, steak and SERVICE was outstanding! I was concerned with not being on the ocean that it would not be a nice property. I was pleasantly surprised. It is on a nice part of the hotel, basically on the same floor as the pool/beach area with covered and open air seating, 1 story above the tiki bar and 2 stories from the main pool area.

Our view was great. The room was excellent. I was traveling with my 12 and 8 year old daughters so the access to the pool area was perfect. They loved it too. Everything was very clean and they did a lot of upgrades. The elevators are a little slow but just a minor due to so much traffic"," The best part is it's NOT a Hilton or Marriott. They have a CLUB GYM inside, a few restaurants on property and have a pool. I choose to visit Kaysville, so this was as important as the picture in my book. The breakfast was awful - terrible waffles and the bacon spongy or burned. I visited in January and the breakfasts options were limited but there was fruit, cereal and yogurt. No eggs to order or bacon. It was over $40 for breakfast - unless you want the small breakfast. The hotel staff did nothing to improve this lack of choices. I think the breakfast manager does not know what the menus is and the managers do not read their boards. All the exchanges and complants were dropped off to the manager. Any friendly repeated question would never be answered. I made 500 pm through text from my bedroom in December 2017. A $40 TEXT and no response by end of day,

They have an awesome lounge area with a TV to check our your travel apps and a piano player at the end of the night to get you all the way down. They have an indoor pool and river level jacuzzi tubs. The indoor pool has a zero entry area like dip-a-loo, if you like that fun for the kids and adults. They have laundry facilities and free WiFi throughout.

As I recall it was taken away because they couldn't handle the foot traffic it brought and it wasn't as popular anymore.  At least at the Berkeley one I knew.  Considering that, I've ordered their Blue Nile (bread, white garlic chicken with soro wat, vegetables) several times, usually 2-4 times per week for 30-45 dollars for 2 people.  At this rate, it easily would cost me $180 to feed a family of 4.  I've decided to use the extra money the club brings in to pay for this with my quarterly 5% discount rate payment.

My 8 year old daughter can tell you that a man did take my daughter's coat but as mommy my heart goes out to the young lady who I'm sure loved her coat but having to have her coat stolen it very sad for her. I'm sure she is not happy about it. Her coat is not just any coat so she might have thought something is amiss with it. I'm relaying this to put awareness that most leave their bags unattended or sometimes under their seat behind the driver.

" My friends and I had a great time here! We all are experienced players, and we were disappointed with the ratio of experienced to inexperienced players, but it was still a lot of fun.
Our favorite part was the giant swing, but we also enjoyed the jail break, secret rooms, and the large hallway. The wide variety of props and backgrounds really make for unique pictures.
If you come as an inexperienced player, be prepared to sweat a lot and to do a lot of crawling. You are also required to wear closed toed shoes, which is good because it keeps the shelter from getting too messy.
If you a veteran like us, I would recommend bringing some snacks, water, and bug spray. The only complaints we have is", Sweet place to play smoke free , Visited on a group trip.

You could barely tell what was what, but it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Definitely going to be stopping by again after the visit! "," First off the Atmosphere here is Awesome. It has a fun, funky and laid back vibe. The food is  authentic Mexican and the prices are really really competetive for what you are eating. The wait staff is outstanding and the service is quick and professional. There are always a major crowd of big folks (workers or out of towners) eating by the bar and on the benches by the window. A slight turn off is the lack of clear wait time information. But if you know what wait time you are looking for there are row of buttons and a hand writing machine by the counter in front of the wall of vending machines. But I will say whoever set up the tables and benches had some awesome matching chairs and a dive bar feel to the whole front part of the restaurant. I'll say 20 beers on the wall, huge & fancy light bulbs and a very beat up piano in the back with some kind of acoustic music playing was totally worthy. ", Rolled tortas and chicken nachos. ,"This place seems to have a loyal cult following. Many of the folks sitting in there seem to be friends and family. In fact, one person visiting said he's brought his kid there since she was two. And they live in Smithville which isn't close by.

The chorizo was very tasty. The refried beans are chunky in a good way. We will have to come here again and try their tacos",Mexican restaurant
 Very nice! All the amenities. Even had a keurig in the room. A water pump in the bath to pump water out of the tub to keep it clean. Im glad I stayed here. ," We had a diner banquet. We ordered the full rack of ribs sliders and shrimp scampi. The scampi was the best than any restaurant i have ordered before and the sectioned scampi was perfectly seasoned.
Unforgettable! I had 3 helpings and was stuffed! The atmosphere was great, VERY clean and well kept! Staff was very very friendly and kept our table cleaned! Will be coming back! "," We stayed to have an event and stayed in the penthrua. Its an indoor mini zoo! Bears, monkeys, snakes, many birds and peacocks. Large glass walls so you could walk around and watch the animals. So fun! We had an event there on Friday. Lots of room inside and outside. Everything was clean and fresh. I like that the hotel has a mini mde but even it had been 100 degrees in Reno and no AC, the mini Market thing has fans and cold water. Service from staff was spot on! I would definitely go back. "," We made it through the snow, so the plow could come through in front of the hotel. Great Room and dining. ","I had a great experience here this week! The views are beautiful from every angle. The rooms are a little outdated and bathroom is small, however I didn't mind because I spent minimal time in the actual room during my stay. You're close to many restaurant options and activities. The pool was heated which was nice during the cool nights! Every employee I interacted with were so friendly and helpful. I'll definitely be back!",Hotel

You don't see that often so they are always changing it up!! My family and I ate here tonight and was happy with everything we got. The garlic knots are always a favorite of mine even if I split it with someone else. This time we got the Caprese salad and I don't think I have ever seen a salad more well done then that was. It was very good and tasted fresh! My husband had the Manicotti and carrot cake I was very surprised at how big the manicotti was. Everything was just delicious!!

In the hall there are staircases to each floor, including a small room with shower, deposit slot and bidet on the same floor! Big plus is the classic deco architecture and city views from many rooms. ", So beautiful from the stroll outside// to our room the view was so breath taking.. the food in the restaurant was good.. old style cooking for the southern country.. and lovely ambiance!! Thank you so much‚ò∫Ô∏è ,Definitely not up to dorchester standards. The hotel is nice. I got really disappointed because we booked a suite for 10 days then left and booked the same suite when I came back for another few days. The first suite was extremely tiny it would even be considered small for a room. On the other hand when I came back and booked the same variety they gave me what was supposed to be a suite. Which is triple the size of the first one. The first one was also very far from the lobby a good 10 minute walk on the other hand the second suite we got was very close to the lobby. Extremely disappointing for a dorchester hotel,Hotel

The lobby has lots of outlets and refrigerators, which is a plus. There are lockers and free kitchen use to, which is again another plus. The dorms have AC and if not the two twin beds were very comfy, the queen sized bed on one of the 5 beddings per room was full but had to turn all five pillows down and comfy.

" It was a very nice hotel, clean and friendly.  That's all. Nothing spectacular. No, that's not right. The hotel was spectacular. Me, not so much. "," Nice place, walls need to be painted, close to the casino "," Stayed there for the first time on a recent trip. My husband and I are platinum and had a great time, the customer service at the hotel is great and everyone there is always willing to help you out. We stayed on a lower level and the rooms were clean, decorated nicely and very modern. Maybe I'm just easy but I had no issues with the room, I slept well every night. It was perfect for what we needed on our trip. "," I hadn't visited this casino for about 8 years! I was in for the night and decided to try their buffet. I could confidently say that it's the best buffet some I ever experienced from a casino venue. Everything from Russian food mackerel to the traditional American lays they covered it. Lots of salads and fruits, and it wasn't a wasted buffet that you always have to question who the hell ate the scalloped potatoes. EVERYTHING looks like it just came out of the oven! I hope they don't close down, employee or not I will be back in the summer season to enjoy a buffet until they close! ",Beautiful grounds and great food. The Palm room is a great spot for an intimate family gathering for up to 46 people.,Hotel
" Absolutely loved the experience, employee was very friendly and nice, snacks unlimited which is a plus, tickets are a little bit expensive but it's expected, the theater is very clean, definitely will be going back "," We liked the theatre for a date night. It was quiet, seats were comfortable and very clean. Ended up watching a movie that even my 5yr old liked. Only con was there wasn't much in the way of concessions if you wanted popcorn or a drink. We stopped by the gift shop before headed out because the concession shop didn't have popcorn or candies. "," Maumelle may get some of the best theater seats in town, but they‚Äôre also the most expensive. And of course, it feels like everything at Target Gin in Fayetteville is much more reasonable. Movie theaters may be the cheapest option for old fashioned fun, but if we‚Äôre being honest, if we‚Äôre spending money on a date night, most of us are probably refreshing our Facebook feeds and entertaining ourselves at home with a movie at our own comfortable couch. That‚Äôs why we love to see Maumelle keep it classy, maintaining that classic retro charm from the 30s and 40s even into the modern era. It‚Äôs slightly out of the way for many in Fayetteville, which may kill the excitement for this pristine Arkansas gem, but those who see it, especially on 5050, will be the most impressed audience in the whole of Northwest Arkansas‚Ä¶unless, of course, you‚Äôre at Cinemark Fayetteville"," Movie theater was great, is aged a little and I guess following remodel has stripped even the better quality seats but the sound and sound system overall was top rate. The place was very clean and pretty spacious for a theater tucked away in a shopping center. The  concessions were stellar and variety of items large. Walmart and Radio tile are all around you and plenty of parking. I will definitely be back soon, just not ear buddies on the seats they were rough and had holes in them :-( ","Seeing John Wick 4.

" First off.. this is one of the cleanest hotels I have been to in a LONG time. The rooms are big, the bed was super comfortable, the bath tub had no signs of any sort of wear, even the hallways and entrance look great.

The staff was very friendly and helpful.

The breakfast had a lot of options, wasn‚Äôt just cereal, waffles, and toast like most other hotels.

The only thing that would of made this experience come up one star was if they were next to have the pool open. That‚Äôs it.

I recommend this highly if you are traveling in the area and are looking for a nice place to stay!! "," Loved our stay at the Sundance Hotel! Our rooms were clean, food at restaurants (Breakfast and Dinner) were great, and there was plenty of hot water, toiletries, etc. We enjoy staying there. "," Spa was great. Place was constantly busy, however with that I thought that proved how hot the LPG room was. There was a sour odor of bodies or deoderant or something to that effect mixed across the casino which was bad & unpleasant. "," We attended a wedding here, and the experience was excellent! The grounds are gorgeous, but the service and (the view) facilities really make a stay wonderful. Every staff member we encountered treated us kindly, noticeably went above and beyond in their duties, and truthfully made every effort to ensure our experience was stress free and wonderful. I have plenty of family scattered across the world and I can‚Äôt wait to bring my daughter back to stroll the grounds with them.

Cute shops are on West Ave, plus the beautiful beaches are literally outside of your hotel door! We spent an afternoon at Tops‚Äôl Beach Club, which was fantastic (swim area, floaties and materials to use, plenty of seating, music options, etc). It‚Äôs a short 5 minute walk or 2 minute drive.

I loved staying at this hotel and will be sure to bring my family back again in the near future. I wish I could attach photos to this written review",Very nice facilities.  Staff in friendly and helpful throughout hotel and casino. Casino is full of plenty of games to play. Food court is nice with lots of different choices. Game areas are clean and sanitized after each use. Hotel rooms are clean and sanitized very well. Rooms are nice and comfortable and I had a nice view of the mountains.,Hotel
 Thanks to the Denver Spice Grills we were able to enjoy this museum. The collection is simply amazing. It feels like you‚Äôve walked back in time. Breathtaking. , Our electricity was off due to a passing storm which was really nice to come and see. We got the audio tour which was really interesting and educational which was great after a day of skiing. My children loved the duck train. I would recommend getting the tour and getting the train ride. ," The stroller was far more enjoyable than pushing baby in an elevator! It was a fun experience for all three generations! And baby was fascinated! I walked in ready for stroller observation, but baby was more interested in crawling through pink dinosaurs.

As a working mom, highlighting the unique pushchair experience was definitely a plus! "," Excellent place for little kids. No Netflix, no video games.  Actual information & exploring. Friendly staff.  Lots of cool activities for the young, & teens too for pretty cheap. ",Must see. Definitely check out the Escape Room. That's an experience and it comes with admission to the museum.,Museum
" We had a questionable double room that was not at all presentable; toilet dirty, tub grout missing tile, upper part of room covered with dust and obvious signs of inhabitation by a rodent-riddled TV. It was only redeeming quality was an excellent location. We  called ahead to ask for a non-smoking room and the risk of encountering a rodent(s) was agreed to. Management has agreed to look into this room and get it back to its status as presented online. Other rooms and the public areas were presentable and satisfactory. "," Came back to Red Lion as a special trip. Situated perfectly at interchange,  room was perfect, staff is fantastic and the pool is a great place to be in the heat. Landscape is beautiful,  rooms feel more updated and looks more like a resort type property in front of pool and restaurant.  Went back here 5 years later,  still the same great experience.

There is no view from the room if you are in the east end block  instead u face the maintenance area of the resort
The resort is dated and not enough staff for something this size and with only 425 rooms.  i sent a toddler down and came back to a room full of used paper towels.  The staff on duty while i stayed was pretty nice although my room would not stay locked. "," Clean, nice, good rooms and awesome room amenities, friendly staff ","Minutes after we walked into our room, I started having severe dust allergies, and the place was filthy. I was shocked because we expect so much more from a Marriott. I called and asked for the room to be cleaned while we were gone for a few hours, telling them that the floor was really dirty and the phone had so much dust on it it appeared it hadn't been cleaned in a very long time (just to give them some examples of the problems.) When we came back, it was clear someone had wiped down the phone briefly and swept the tile floor in the doorway, but the room was still filthy. I called again and let them know, and to their credit, they upgraded us to a much nicer much cleaner room. And I wasn't allergic to this room which was visibly less dusty and dirty.
We were thankful for the upgrade, but it should have never been necessary. I shouldn't walk into a room in a Marriott property to find it so dirty.

I have attached pictures of the floor in the bathroom, the floor in the entryway, the phone, and the shower curtain, which had grime and very questionable hairs crusted onto it...",Hotel

Will definitely try the Coconut Sticky rice "," i was not too impressed after having eaten here a few years back. The baked crab dip was flavorful but the portions were very small for the price.

" Love the close canopy walkways & that many animals have water areas to swim in. They have great food carts throughout the zoo too. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. We came on a Saturday afternoon and it was pretty busy, but we found enough open seating. Parking is $20, so just be aware. Also, if you‚Äôre able, try to get there right when it opens. You‚Äôll encounter less crowds and can see more animals waking up for the day. We‚Äôll be back! "," A very nice wooden and iron detail in the layout looks amazing.

Ducks and swans very nice. Some Acrylic animals are trick since you could them as real on taking a look at them closer.  I mean...a big smile on a big cat's heading face?

We managed to make it into the right room, though the end mashup was challenging. The owners were informed and helped us continue on. "," Locally owned and operated. Down to earth, genuine people run a fun place. Lots of quests to try and a variety of themed rooms. Make sure to put $$$ in the envelope before you get bounced in for being claustrophobic. ", Love this place very fun experience with friends to try and figure out individual puzzles & find the items with other people.  Not as easy as it sounds and you don't have much time! Will be returning when I can! ,"I went to this place for the first time ever for my birthday and I made the comment that an insatiable, escape-room monster has been made of me. A little over a month later I‚Äôve already gone through most of the rooms available, with plans to then move to the other location and start tackling the rooms available there as well. The amount of work that must have gone in to these rooms baffles me. There are some puzzles that, when solved, result in things to happen in the room that I‚Äôm not sure whether is through the work of intricate wiring or the diligence of the room attendant person. Speaking of room attendant person, I‚Äôve had my party overseen by Alex most of the times I‚Äôve been there and he is a treasure. Super helpful and personable, and so quick to observe when we‚Äôve done something slightly wrong to nudge us a tad and tell us to hey maybe try that thing again. Of course his nudges are always warranted and never ruin any puzzle or sense of achievement we feel when we hear the lock click. He‚Äôs also very quick to deliver clues when we do ask for them, and the clues are always exactly what we need. I could go on forever about how much I enjoy this place, and recommend it to everyone, so I‚Äôll just end this review here.",Escape room center

 We stopped here for a night in our travels.  It is a typical Hilton Resort hotel. Nothing out of the ordinary. Actually it was a little run down compared to most others that I have been too. The pools close at 6:00 pm. Needless to say my children were disappointed in that. They enjoyed the water park but it closed at 5:00 pm. There was a entertainment schedule at the pool every day but it quit early. The food at the grill was reasonably priced which was wonderful.  My only complaint there was there was no chicken tenders for my picky eater. The servers were exceptional there!!! The staff were all friendly. The rooms were nice and clean. The beds were so comfortable. I would stay here again," Came here with my family today to go zip lining, only here to sightseeing.

The chef love the but I suggest you buy fresh cloved from whole foods or organic grocer that have the authentic flavors. ," Great pizza and wings. My grandma used to live above the shop so we have been customers for decades. Their beef and cheese is house made, sweet & sticky and it just melts in your mouth. And if you're not in the mood for pizza, don't knock it until you try it. You'll be back! I usually just get a slice when I stop in for the football games so this pic doesn't do the slice size justice. Douse it in garlic butter and order some of their wings.

They have a planetarium, hiking trails, they'll pick you up when you get lost, a cafe, and the history of dinosaurs is so well put together. I was genuinely impressed. If you like dinosaurs, you'll love this place. It'd be really cool if they had some airplanes hanging from the ceiling like some other museums have. The collection could use an update as well- I'd love to see some new baby dinosaurs (no parasaurs tho ü§¶‚ÄΩü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and some government issued models of the creatures too.

The restaurant had great food, but since it was Christmas Eve the service was really really slow at dinner. This is the back patio facing the Rock Rd.
