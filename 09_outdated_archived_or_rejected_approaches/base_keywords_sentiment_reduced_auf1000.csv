Very niche complaint here, I know, but this is so frustrating. Aside from some of the games being broken (some for several months now), new games like Music Diver end up lagging.

But one thing that could easily be fixed is removing the acrylic plates keeping people from scanning their cards or putting in their PIN numbers on the touch screen.

3.0,2022-04-04T08:06:09.427Z,Muneera Abdulmohsen,Definitely not up to dorchester standards. The hotel is nice. I got really disappointed because we booked a suite for 10 days then left and booked the same suite when I came back for another few days. The first suite was extremely tiny it would even be considered small for a room. On the other hand when I came back and booked the same variety they gave me what was supposed to be a suite. Which is triple the size of the first one. The first one was also very far from the lobby a good 10 minute walk on the other hand the second suite we got was very close to the lobby.

Their tacos are prepared ""pinned"" and are awesome!!  The salsa and chips came out still warm!!  They have an extensive menu but I always seem to stick with the pinned tacos.

The salsa was not good...either one. Mild is too sweet and hot just taste like tomato soup. I ordered chicken flautas. I couldn't even eat it they were so dry. It was tortilla fried like the chips filled with a hard lump of dry chicken. The sauce and sour cream didn't make it edible. My partner got the pork burritos. Not allowed to get different meat choices for each burrito without a crazy upcharge so he got all pork. They were pretty bland and the pork was dry but had enough sauce to be edible. The kids were not happy with their food either (hotdog and kids enchilada). To top it all off we paid $50 for two adult and two kid meals that basically no one liked at all.

2.0,2022-08-20T00:41:29.717Z,Courtney M,"The waitstaff is amazing!! Angela is fantastic! And I'll admit the hand pinched taco was tasty! (Beef with parm)  The house frozen margarita was incredibly sweet. Which I like, but the alcohol is very light. And from here on out, just NO.

The waitstaff and busser is the only reason they got 2 stars!

Do not walk, run!  The salsa was interesting. It was okay and had carrot bits in it. Odd, but I like to try new things. I got the spinach dip. The large. The most disgusting dip I've ever had. It tastes like the cheese was the cheapest they could find and I couldn't tell if the spinach was from a can or a cheap frozen brick. Other than that it was beyond bland. There was an odd taste I've had before but I couldn't even eat 1/8 without the margarita. (And sadly I will gorge on cheese dip.) So, no to the salsa, no to the spinach cheese dip, and the chips are eh. The frozen margarita, was really weak, definitely not worth $6, but sweet if that's how you like it. I do. 😊 The pinched taco... okay, I really enjoyed that! The waitstaff - someone needs to poach them!!! This place doesn't deserve them.

Edit:
The frozen margarita,  I still stand by that it is sweet, but I have more of a buzz than I realized. So the alcohol's just kind of hidden.  I will say I would indulge in another frozen Margarita here.

The ""busser"" I referred to, come to find out, is the manager. Not expected, but he was a hard worker, great personality, friendly, and very welcoming.

I will admit, he said several people commented on the dip saying it tasted weird and took it off no issues or real questions.

I personally don't plan on coming back. But if they were slow and I was bored and wanted to chat with the staff, I would eat a taco and have a margarita. If you live close by, and love to support Mom and Pop places as I do, I say give it a try and leave your experience on here. Maybe I just caught them on a really off day. Or maybe I'm a little spoiled. 🤷‍♀️",El Sombrero Mexican Restaurant,,"No-nonsense Mexican spot serving tacos, fajitas & other staples, along with margaritas.",$,4.3,1.0,True,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bHJUSV9RRRAB,Mexican restaurant,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM72AmD5OqeldlbLH42IE29K9ydn28fngCmEGQd=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bHJUSV9RRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x7a83ab0f7396465d!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDulrTI_QE%7CCgwIuduAmAYQuPiZ1gI%7C?hl=en-US,113384112273678267486,28.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5Qd3FDG3a0JitqoDGnLujoXkHiASltjcW-yxMntZDc=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113384112273678267486?hl=en-US,1192,2023-03-26T09:36:34.159Z,Missouri,79 US-69,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/El+Sombrero+Mexican+Restaurant/@39.1558178,-94.6226482,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x87c0f8e14c6778e5:0x7a83ab0f7396465d!8m2!3d39.1970678!4d-94.5048943!16s%2Fg%2F1td0y_d5?hl=en",https://www.elsombrerokcmo.com/,Mexican restaurant,Latin American restaurant,Restaurant,Mexican restaurant,restaurant,"[('waitstaff', 0.3272), ('taco', 0.2952), ('tasted', 0.27), ('tastes', 0.2439), ('margarita', 0.2216)]","['waitstaff', 'taco', 'tasted', 'tastes', 'margarita']",,,real,ChIJ5XhnTOH4wIcRXUaWcw-rg3o

Never heard about or used it before but it seemed it had got nice reviews and ratings on several travel websites. The price was also very good, especially compared to those resorts and cabins inside RMNP (Riding Mountain National Park). These are attractive enough so I decided to give it a try.

I have to tell you that I was not disappointed at all even though I  set my expectation very high. This B&B is right out of the town of Onanole, on a small hill right beside Hwy 10. Only 7km from the entrance of RMNP, you have easy and quick access to the park while still enjoy the quiet and beautiful setting of the B&B. The historic building has been beautifully restored and tastefully decorated. The room feels cozy and the bed is comfortable and supportive. The full breakfast (with bacon, egg/omelette, toasts, fruits, and coffee) was delicious. There are lots of other amenities for the gusts to enjoy, like the huge deck, the lounge room with TV, etc. Too bad I stayed for two nights only and was too busy to fully enjoy them.

We enjoyed the back deck immensely and found ourselves out there every night. While we were there the owners, Cindy and Earl began another project on the grounds, preparing an area for wedding ceremonies to be held. I am certain that is going to be a great addition to the property and well received in the area.

The breakfast service was excellent. As someone that loves to cook, I could easily see the passion that went into the morning meal.

The beds are amazingly comfortable and the sheets are out of this world comfortable. The great news is that you can buy the same sheets and bring home a brand new set for yourself.

We loved the ""Space Invaders"", ""air hockey""  and ""breakout"" like games.

However, some of the games were maybe to smart for me.

The food was surprisingly good!
As well as the mixed drinks, when you need a break from the activities.

So you enter a brightly lit room to pay for entry….and then you go into a tunnel of neon lights and immediately are submerged into a neon maze of fun! There are several different activities to enjoy along with a drink station and bar. My son and I went and paid $18 a ticket for a pass for a few hours. Some of the games where really fun and interactive well others where kind of meh. The dodgeball space invader game and the larger than life breakout game where are favorites. The only downsides are it does get crowded and kind of smelly…I mean there’s lots of kids running around sweating 😅 also there isn’t that much to do considering majority of the main events get completed fairly quickly. We where kind of over it after an hour due to all the screaming kids but the initial wow factor is great. We decided to hit the snack bar and I was hoping for an adult beverage but no one would help us. The staff was in the kitchen dancing and the bartender only seemed interested in helping a certain group of people at the bar.

Food is good. Sad they never brought the banana tempura back. My issue is the rise in price over the years. I remember when the plates were a little over $2 each. Now, its almost $4. The ramen used to be about $5, now it's $10. Ridiculous price for a little bowl! We used to spend around $50, but now our total is $80, for less food! It's just not worth eating here anymore.

For starters it's way expensive: $375 for a tiny room with no desk, no useable coffee table (it had stacks of glued together wooden blocks in varying heights) only 1 chair and a tough squeeze to get into my side of the bed. Parking was $55 for 1 night! Room service breakfast (everything else was closed) cost $75! (Oatmeal, toast, eggs, pancakes, coffee for 2  and it was cold). The bathroom has no space for a bag or anything. The sink is non standard height (too low), the lamps are all crooked (about 45 degrees), the walls are unfinished concrete, and electrical outlets are gang boxes fed by 1"" and 1/2"" conduits. And for $20 you get to take a plain looking river pebble - they sell it as a memento.",The LINE LA,,"Adjacent to the Wilshire / Normandie subway station, this hip hotel in a midcentury building in Koreatown is 4 miles from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

절대로 비싼방 예약하지 말고 제일 저렴한 king room 으로 예약후 호텔가서 hollywood hills view로 30불 내고 업그레이드 하세요!!

호텔의 기본이 안되어 있다.
방음 전혀 안되어있다. (바깥 소리가 있는 그대로 정말 그대로 다 들림) 호텔에서 ear plugs를 하고 잘 줄이야!!
히터는 소음이 심하고 계속 고장이 난다.(고쳐주고 갔으나 새벽에 또 고장이 났다. 밤새 세게 틀어도 실내온도 18도)
뜬금없이 새벽에 TV가 켜진다 그것도 두 번 씩이나.
(TV 세팅 요청했으나 수정되지 않음)
드라이어 찬바람만 나와서 교체요청했으나 깔끔하게 무시함. (메이드가 멕시코 사람이라 영어를 못읽는거라고 생각하며 화를 가라앉힘)
2명으로 예약했으나 항상 1명분으로 세팅이 되어있어 요청을 해야 갖다준다. (슬리퍼, 가운 등)
기본으로 제공되는 물이 없다.
5불짜리 피지워터를 먹었으나 10불짜리로  결제되어 있고 끝까지 내가 10불짜리를 먹었다며 환불을 안해주었다. (한국돌아오는 길에 핸드폰 결재내역 떠서 바로 따지지 못하고 에이전시(티몬) 통해서 이의제기 했더니 내가 10불짜리 피지워터를 먹었다고 수차례 주장했다고 한다. 당연히 나도 “수차례” 5불짜리 피지워터를 먹었다고 말할 수 밖에... 귀찮게스리)
어메니티피가 1박당 15불+tax 있다. 체크인 할 때 알려주지 않아 당황스럽다.

더 최악은 따로 있다
Hollywood hills view로 예약했으나 일반 킹룸으로 예약되어 있다며 본인들의 “선의”로 헐리우드 방향의 ’앞집 지붕 view’의 방을 주었다.
3일 내내 일반 킹룸으로 예약된게 맞다고 우기더니 마지막날 매니저 Susie가 방으로 전화하더니
“당신들은 헐리우드힐뷰로 예약된게 맞으며 지금 있는 그 방이 헐리우드힐뷰가 맞다.” 라고 얘기했다.
Alex라는 직원(우리가 일반킹룸이 맞다며 재차 확인해줬던 사람)과 3자대면을 하자고 요청하여 만났더니 감정없이 미안하다는 말 한마디 하면서 1박당 30불을 환불해주겠다고 한다. 벽에 대고 얘기하는 느낌.
뭐라고? 난 180불을 더 냈는데 90불을 환불을 해준다고? 담당자는 30불이라는 말만 끊임없이 반복함.

Номера не большие, но все очень чисто, постельное бельё и полотенца белоснежные. Кровать удобная. В номере есть холодильник, кофейные принадлежности. Нам не хватило микроволновки. Поскольку мы знали, что приедем поздно и все магазины и кафе будут закрыты, мы купили еду по дороге, думали подогреть в номере и поужинать. Но не получилось. В номере есть компактный душ, все необходимые туалетные принадлежности . Цена для отеля конечно дороговата. Но это видимо обусловлено близостью к Гранд каньону и очень высокими ценами на отели, расположенные более близко к национальному парку. Да, от этого отеля дорога до южного входа в Гранд каньон занимает 1 час 40 минут. И это конечно не очень здорово. Но в более близких отелях цены просто зашкаливают.В целом остались довольны мотелем.

4.0,2022-04-05T03:44:32.388Z,Dean Krapf,"A whole lot to say about our visit.

It was opening day so things were bound to go a bit sideways.

Pros:

Kammi our ref - absolutely amazing! She was attentive to the group, very friendly but had no problem calling out safety items the instant someone's mask wasn't all the way down or an uncovered barrell. She was great and I highly recommend you request her if you are taking a group.

The different games fields were fun and challenging. Our group had seasoned vets and first time adults and teens so it was well balanced. Kammi started us out easy and then introduced respawns and play until you're out of paint which everyone loved.

The field paint quality was really good in my opinion. Very consistent and I wish I had a marker that could really sling it.

The whole staff was friendly and went above and beyond to ensure everyone was safe and having fun.

Cons:

The hiccups of opening day with any business, but the owner and his team took it in stride and powered through.

Ran out of air so they were transporting tanks back and forth. Also ran out of cases of paint but that too was resolved with a trip the their warehouse.  These two items didn't affect our play or the amount of fun we had.

The rental markers were all over the place. Different models, broken detents, etc.  Once again - opening day, but it's on the calendar - clean and check everything weeks in advance. We replaced a few tank o-rings ourselves from our parts kits to save time.

No chronographing of walk on players. The rentals were slow and hot and some walk on teens were definitely pushing 300 fps. That's a safety thing especially with rental masks/lenses and horrible experience for young teens playing for the first time.

2.0,2022-10-07T21:00:00.970Z,Randy M,"Here’s the good and the bad and the very bad.

The good: The front desk staff who checked us in was very nice, the front office is very nice, and the shower was very nice. Get the picture?

The bad: this is an old motel that needs updating. The carpets are ripped, the sofa is ripped and covered up with a coverlet rather than replacing it, there is a mirror in front of the sofa rather than a TV to look at, and the bed is old and sagging in the middle. And this is an executive suite!Figure that out. Just look at the pictures.

The very bad: we booked a King executive suite. We were told that someone had already taken that suite and extended their stay. Instead of telling them that we had a reservation and that the motel could move them to another room, we were told that we would be moved to another room. We were given a queen executive suite. No discount. No offer of points. Just a “sorry, we can’t guarantee a room.”  When we complained, the manager was quite generous (please note that is sarcasm) by giving  us a whole 500 points. Wow-wee!

The very very bad: And they have the nerve to charge over $200 for the room.

PS The microwave was unplugged and that was because it didn’t work, which I reported to the morning clerk. They don’t serve breakfast in the motel. You have to go next door to the restaurant and the tip is not included. But honestly, we wished we had skipped breakfast because the cook must’ve had a bad morning and most of the food was not cooked enough - runny eggs although ordered fried hard, hash browns hard on one side/soft on the other, the same with the English muffin.

No worries,  it's not like I'm a slob. Went to the housekeeping cart & called out into a room I assumed was being cleaned & nobody answered or was in the room. I put my dirty towels in the bag hanging off the cart & grabbed clean ones & was good to go. No worries.  Put a do not disturb on my door & all was well. My complaint is that there were so many flies in my room when I arrived on the day before. I used a hand towel & killed them all. The a/c filters were filled with lint, like a clothes dryer filter. (The pictures I'm showing here are AFTER I cleaned them). I pulled them out & banged them together outside my door & the lint flew off into the wind. Then I rinsed them off in the shower & dried them & put them back. No worries 👍 sneezing problem solved. Also had to use a hand towl in room 114 to slam in the bottom of the entry door where critters could crawl in from outside.  The insulation on the bottom right corner of the door was missing.  Showerhead had bad water pressure due to corrosion as well & several outlets in the room didn't work. Other than that the place isn't that bad. I'll return for work but bring a flyswatter & clean the a/c filters in the room with each visit.",Best Western Colorado River Inn,,"Located just off Historic Route 66, this laid-back hotel is a mile from both Rivers Edge Golf Course and Needles Marina Park.

I am paranoid about travelling due to the current pandemic, but I didn’t have a worry in the world with how spotless and clean this room was. Felt comfortable, and like home. No dirt, dust bunnies ANYWHERE.

Check in was fast an efficient. This motel could be charging way more than they are for the quality of rooms they provide.

The rooms had pots, pans, dishes, utensils, and whatever else you could need to make yourself a quick meal if you didn’t feel like going out to a nearby restaurant.

The bed was comfy, which is a rare find in most motels. They also has 3 different mattress protectors on the mattress itself, all extremely clean. They provide an additional blanket on top of the shelf as well.

I was also extremely grateful for the working air conditioner, another rare find in motels.

If you are making a cross country drive like I was, I highly recommend planning to stop here for a good nights rest.

(Also I greatly appreciated the little cat feet socks on the chair legs, just adorable.)",Quest Motel,,,,4.7,4.0,True,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4b29EZ093EAE,Motel,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGF5Hja7wiMw_WCXCSMqbLvOwMYqDw_LJQodl1=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2K7bL9eys09Wco5DPmA_4x4Try54WzmQdjGk-=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMYlNcrC1bN1eEVkvXikhEYSiRRQTPwnbt7Nra=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4b29EZ093EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x4fb2d158d60e0e1!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC8ooDgOw%7CCgsIktTi9wUQuJPyEg%7C?hl=en-US,110547249124063660614,34.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5S8BpoE4CZcqLEPe7aR2d1ylovsNd-K-hee3IfX8Q=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110547249124063660614?hl=en-US,209,2023-03-26T11:30:40.830Z,Saskatchewan,913 Service Rd,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Quest+Motel/@49.4677703,-107.8952702,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x52e1a18770802d25:0x4fb2d158d60e0e1!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d50.3355339!4d-102.2634103!16s%2Fg%2F1tcw383_?hl=en",https://instagram.com/questmotel?igshid=ZDdkNTZiNTM=,Motel,,,Motel,hotel,"[('motel', 0.5168), ('motels', 0.4298), ('rooms', 0.3664), ('bed', 0.3278), ('room', 0.3238)]","['motel', 'motels', 'rooms', 'bed', 'room']","[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.38295137882232666}]",,real,ChIJJS2AcIeh4VIR4eBgjRUt-wQ

Probably one the best buffet deals you can find in MN. Piles of aromatic rice pilafs. Really fresh and tasty desserts. Not quite traditional pistachio baklava, but baklava-shaped with creamy gooey ness inside.

There were tons of stews but I really like okra so I downed the okra stew. Also the giant potatoes with sauce was great.

Service was great - down to earth and friendly. The decor is as it should be: diner-like without the fru fru extras. Mostly tables and standard stackable chairs.

5.0,2021-06-29T05:41:41.457Z,Jason Pederson,"I come to LA for the Vanderpump experience.  I visit all of her restaurants, TomTom, SUR, and of course PUMP.   PUMP is by far, my favorite, though they are all great.   It's the ambiance of the large olive trees and lighting designed by Lisa herself.   It's the music which is at just the right level so you can have a great connection with everyone you are with, and even make a new friend.  The food never disappoints.  It's also the staff.  We had exceptional service from servers and server assistants, but the one person, other than getting to see and chat with LVP herself, that makes this special for me is Logan, who is a server here.   He's warm and genuine.  You feel like you have known him forever.   He makes me feel like special VIP, and then I look around and he is treating everyone this way!  Now I might be slightly jealous of this ;) but he is just that amazing and is an all around good guy.    He is not just my Server, but I consider him my friend.

The issue I had were with front desk.  Did not have my room reservation when I checked in.  At one point I had over $1200 in temporary authorizations.  Went to front desk multiple times and was assured those temp charges would be removed at checkout.

Day of check out I ask for itemized list of charges which was at zero.  Couple hours later I receive a revised bill with me owing $259.  Call the resort and literally no one picks up the phone on multiple attempts to try and resolve this issue.

Have to send it to our company event coordinator to see if this will get fixed.

My advice is to watch your bill closely at this hotel.

1.0,2021-08-06T20:55:33.544Z,Omar & Brandon Troutbaugh,"This was our second stay at the property, so we had expectations that it would match our previous one. That was not the case at all.

Our room was somewhat clean on arrival even though there were sunflower seed shells scattered at the entrance that remained during our stay even with multiple housekeeping visits. On our first morning, we noticed that we had not been given washcloths. Instead, there was a wet one hanging from the shower rod. Disgusting. I contacted the front desk three times and it took an hour to receive them. That’s a bit extreme. Not to mention they seemed to be surprised/bothered by the request. I know I was by the third call. There was also trash underneath the bed that we were in no way going to retrieve and neither did the housekeeping staff feel it necessary.

What happened next will go in my book of the most disgusting hotel experiences ever. While completing some emails, I noticed there was a weird yellow stain on the partially exposed mattress pad. I didn’t want to think it was what I immediately thought it was, but then I took a whiff. It was unmistakably urine. I immediately called the front desk and asked for the manager after telling them what I found. I received a call about ten minutes later saying that the manager was unavailable and that a supervisor from housekeeping would be up to check out the situation. After the call, I did a little more inspecting and actually lifted the mattress pad. That when I discovered a large urine stain directly on the mattress. Took pictures as well. I called back and informed the front desk, and while they were surprised, communicated no sense of urgency as I demanded to see the manager again to have the mattress replaced. I became tired of waiting and went to the beach for the last few hours that our rented space was available. It was my expectation that the mattress would be replaced by the time I returned. Nope! So, I called again demanding the manager and a fresh mattress. Instead, I was offered to switch rooms, to which I replied, “You want us to pack up the entire room to go to another room with a potential whole different set of problems?” Needless to say, that didn’t sit well. So, I waited some more until about 30 minutes later someone from housekeeping finally showed up to assess the situation. Again, she offered to move us and again I declined and expressly told them to change the mattress and replace the linens. After some huffing and puffing of disbelief by the housekeeping representative, a new mattress finally arrived. Then she proceeded to put the same linens that were on the soiled mattress back on the new mattress to which we had to emphatically correct that behavior, to which also was accompanied by disbelief on her part. The rest of our time in the room we just felt dirty and never really clean. Not to mention a daily vacuuming of a hotel room beachfront would have been a nice touch. Plus, I couldn’t believe that an oceanfront room was smaller than the suite we had on the previous stay, but I digress.

There were a few occasions that we ate in the Carolina Room and while the service was excellent, the space wasn’t maintained well at all. During a breakfast visit, we were seated at a table where it appeared that the remnants of the previous diner’s meal was scattered all over the floor. I’m not sure why the hostess thought that was appropriate and we were hoping that someone would notice and it at least clean up the debris. That didn’t happen. The breakfast buffet was underwhelming and we about got severely burned by the chafing dish containing the grits. The food was edible, but needless to say, we didn’t return for breakfast going forward. Dinner on the other hand was pretty good and we had particularly attentive service.

In the end, we won’t be back and will advise our friends of the same. Perhaps assuming that our expectations would be met based on our previous stay was a mistake. We definitely didn’t get what we paid for.",The Westin Hilton Head Island Resort & Spa,,"This upscale beachfront resort is 0.5 miles from Port Royal Golf & Racquet Club and 1.3 miles from the Adventure Cove entertainment center.

4.0,2022-07-23T03:24:41.114Z,Alisa J Lor,"This is our first time staying at this location. I hope to give some thorough information as I read many mixed reviews before staying here ....
The hotel itself is slightly outdated. This can be seen on many reviews. Now, even though it is outdated, it is still VERY well kept overall. The rooms were very clean, the food areas were great and the common areas inside the hotel were beautiful. The pool areas did need attention. There were frequently plastic cups floating in one of the pools. A waterfall feature of the pool was not in use anymore and instead had many trash pieces and was starting to grow fungus looking things.
The restaurants were very yummy and service there was great. Drinks were tasty and priced well.
The biggest frustration of the hotel was the communication and activity calendar. They hand you an activity calendar and I spent much time preparing my kids for the great activities. However, most workers didn't know what was going on, some events didn't even occur. Kids crafts were free one day and then the next they were $17 to paint a canvas and make a pinwheel. The movie stated on the calendar was not the movie playing one night. It was just sad to see so many great events planned but yet, no communication and no great follow through.
Overall, I would definitely stay at this hotel many times again. I do hope that somehow they can get better communication between the workers and the events calendar. They set themselves apart having fun activities, now they just need to follow through!",The Westin Hilton Head Island Resort & Spa,,"This upscale beachfront resort is 0.5 miles from Port Royal Golf & Racquet Club and 1.3 miles from the Adventure Cove entertainment center.

So I requested the refund. The employee didn't believe me because he said they opened a new box & it is not expired. I told him the package is sticky & the expiration is July 19 ,2021. So posting the review to show that mistakes can be made and everyone is not scamming for money. I would rather eat my salad than recieve a refund.

5.0,2021-12-18T21:11:51.358Z,Leah Michelle,"We are here last night, December 17th 2021, for my my husband's 28th birthday.

We have lived in Baldwin for 2 years and those years have been pretty rough, we were so lucky to find an apartment in sweet and quiet Baldwin City. We love it here and plan on buying a home. We've experienced quite a few events here but this was our first local restaurant. We were finally able to come to The Wooden Spoke after hearing so much about it and we brought friends from out of town.

What a charming, down-home, relaxed place. The parking lot felt like you were pulling into a old-time drive in, but you get out of your car and reach the door and it feels like you are standing outside of someone's well-loved home. The tables reminded me of my own kitchen tables in my childhood home. I felt comfortable as soon as I sat down. The waitress was extremely attentive, her energy was calm and sincere. Our drink orders were taken immediately, our appetizers came out quickly and the entrees were the best home cooking we all have had in many years.

We ordered the KC strip, the ribeye, the bourban steak and the spoke burger, spoke fries, mash potatoes, the chilli, mozzarella sticks, potato skins, and the wings in this beautiful honey brown sauce that was sweet, spicy, smoky and honestly it was incredible. I love WINGS and these took the trophy from me and my friends!

Our food and plates were hot, the food was fast. All the steaks were cooked as asked, all steaks were medium rare, juicy, delicious and quite big. Burger was done just well and had a classic burger taste.

The alcoholic beverages were delicious and made strong.

My daughter ordered the kids chicken strips and she said they were very good, we loved the fries. The spoke burger was amazing and the mustard tasted homemade. My husband especially loved the chilli. Overall, the food was spectacular. The service was fast and friendly, the environment was clean and comfy. We will definitely be back.

Thank you wooden spoke staff and mad respect and kudos to the Chef who made an unforgettable night full of nostalgic decor, warm and friendly interaction and phenomenal home-cooking! See you again soon!!

We stopped here so we didn’t have to continue to drive on our long trip. All we wanted was a clean hotel where we could sleep and shower with our two children! The shower even has black hairs! Black hairs were all over the first room and we asked to switch to find the same thing. The floors are not vacuumed at all. It’s unreal. I have never stayed at a Wyndham hotel but it looked VERY nice in the photos and I never imagined it would be this dirty. The cleaning in this hotel... well there obviously wasn’t any real cleaning done. There should never be leftovers from other strangers in a hotel I paid for. I would have rather drove three more hours then not have a nice place to sleep and shower at. I am very upset and I have NEVER in my life wrote a review. I am not hard to please! The Wi-Fi code does not work. The phone does not work. The phone plug keeps falling out every time I pick up the phone. The top layer of the sheet had dirt on it or food. Looks like cake. I stay at many hotel. This is unacceptable. Also On top of this. I was told you guys price match. There was a deal online that was $20 cheaper than the right here and they said they could not do it. So even more annoyed right now that I came here because I thought I was getting a deal. After having heart issues with my bank it took a little longer than necessary which is totally my fault. My car got blocked because were out of town. I would have paid the extra money to stay in a clean hotel but after carrying all of her bags and everything up for four people, me and my husband have to work tomorrow. And both of our kids are ready for bed. None of us will be showering in the bathroom and we are all disgusted to the point we don’t want to get off our beds u less we have our shoes on.
Livid to say the least. The cleaning lady left a envelope for a tip???? She has to be joking. She needs to be fired. Oh!!! and the what class that my daughter went to use had a big black hair in it. Look close at pics! Gross!!!!

Staff is very friendly. I will say. They were nice. Although a guy followed us up to make sure the second room was clean. It wasn’t.. and he walked away and did nothing.

We called the front desk and one of the staff members came immediately and defused the situation and had the man move. She stayed there until we were done.

When we woke up, I could see oily fingerprints on the headboard, something sneezed or splashed onto the TV, someone's grocery store card they accidentally left behind, and some rather dirty looking blood stains on one of the pillow cases.

The tiles and grout near the tub were a bit in disrepair, but overall things appeared tolerably clean and satisfactory unless you looked closely. I feel like the cleaning job is one of the biggest customer services a hotel can offer, because you don't want to feel like you're constantly touching other people's left behind germs, lube residue, etc. It was a major detraction.

The breakfast was okay but the lady behind the counter (responsible for cooking the eggs and everything) seemed spread very thin in her duties.

3.0,2022-11-07T11:29:27.016Z,Jacqueline Hartman,"We stopped at a quick one night stop to get some sleep, shower, and back get on the road. It was on the way to where we were headed, so it worked perfectly. Things that need improvement: 1. The thermostat. It was not accurate and as you can see my thermostat said it was 65% humidity, because theirs wasn’t working and wouldn’t trigger air on its own. My husband continued to smell mildew every time he walked into the room, I must have missed it the 2 times I walked in. 2. The vent, it could use some cleaning. I am not sure how clean the air we manually forced out of it was.
Good things on why I scored it high: 1. Price was great. 2. Location for us was awesome. 3. It did the job provide a nice firm mattress for us to get some good shut eye. The pillows could have been comfier, but for the price I will not complain! 4. The one person we interacted with at the desk was great. 5. Had a pool, we didn’t use it but I heard kids were enjoying it when I was checking in. 6. Overall thought things were relatively clean! 7. The bathroom was super cute and had a cool mirror/light. 8. There was a tv, but we didn’t use it. It was small for some standards, but I didn’t care as we were actually just using it for sleep.

If you are looking for a quick stop to get some good sleep and this is on the way, would 100% recommend. If you are looking for a fancier vacation hotel I would probably look elsewhere, but I’m not sure if that’s the area for fancier hotels.",Wyndham Garden Cross Lanes Charleston,,"This roadside hotel next to I-64 is a 12-mile drive from Downtown Charleston and 3.5 miles from the West Virginia State University.

2.0,2022-08-12T23:21:45.984Z,Ulyana K,"Not a great experience overall. The only redeeming factors about the hotel are the price and the friendly employees. I stayed here while doing business in the area. I figured that swimming in one of 2 pools would be a great way to relax afterwards, especially for the price. Well, it could have definitely been better.

The first thing I noticed about the hotel is the smell of marijuana in the elevator. Then, when I got up to the hotel room, I tried to get in with the key cards they gave me. It took me no less than 10 tries to successfully use this card. I swiped it almost the same way 10 times, and it magically opened on the 10th.

The room itself was somewhat chilly when I got in. I changed the temperature and it started to heat up quickly. But, there was another odd burnt smell coming from the conditioner. It was dirty, too. Breakfast was decent. Food was nothing special, but the guy serving breakfast was awesome. Very friendly, even though I just had some coffee he offered me some freshly cooked food.

The pools were nice. Not too many people at night or during the day. Expect it to be more crowded at 9 pm than at 11 am, though. There were loads of what seemed to be pool algae all around the pool (dark green in color) but the water itself was clean. Good ambiance with the rocks and faux plants. Not too cold or too warm. Decent fitness center, too. Treadmill worked fine, they had dumbbells and a few other strength training machines. Pretty basic and small.

It's a bit tough to sleep during the night. They didn't give any pillows or blankets for the 2nd room with the pull out bed. You can hear everything and I was a bit concerned about a door near my room. People walking in and out all the time and you will surely hear some of that.

All in all, if you want a cheap hotel with 2 pools, this may be the place. The location is pretty convenient and the employees were very friendly. There are some cleanliness, room entrance, and sleeping issues, though.",Wyndham Garden Cross Lanes Charleston,,"This roadside hotel next to I-64 is a 12-mile drive from Downtown Charleston and 3.5 miles from the West Virginia State University.

There's a sign around hot tub saying it's closed so we go ask what the deal is since that was a deciding factor of where we stayed since the nephew was with us. The guy gets kinda rude and says the pool is closed too, but nobody seems to know why. He goes to the pool and puts makeshift sign on the door and tells everyone they need to leave. We go to room, change back into regular clothes, and head downstairs. Upon speaking to the manager apparently the pool is fine but hot tub has a leaking pipe (not what sign says) so it'll remain closed. I'm giving 2 stars rather than 1 because the refund process was pretty seamless.

Plenty of lounge seating and common space in lobby since they kept the check-in area/front desk small and minimal to make way for more room for amenities. Very nice patio and firepit with views of downtown KC. Decent saltwater pool and hot tub. Asked for corner room since they generally have more space, they were nice enough to oblige upon checkin. Very friendly helpful staff. On the smaller side, family-friendly and near nicer lifestyle shopping centers with dining. The only gripes I had were that walls and floors were very thin and I could hear every footstep and stomps of the family above me at all hours, and every toilet flush. Note that they don't have microwaves in the room (not even for extra deposit) which is understandable and fine for a higher-end hotel, but this was more budget-friendly and family friendly and sometimes that is a godsend if you are traveling with kids.",Courtyard by Marriott Kansas City at Briarcliff,,"Connected to The View at Briarcliff Event Space, this modern hotel is 6 miles from the Sprint Center and 7 miles from the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.

The place in dingy, so be prepared for that; the sign is in disrepair, badly needs paint, the patio section desperately needs to be remodeled, broken down cars out front (as well as a broken down boat). Now, as to the food: pretty good. I got the Rancocas Burger and was generally pretty impressed other than it being overcooked (ordered medium, came out well. I still ate it cause I'm not that annoying about my food). While I could be way off base, it had a sort of lack of flavor that's reminiscent of cheapish frozen beef. Not trying to spread lies if maybe it was just a bit under seasoned but that's what it reminded me of.

3.0,2022-08-23T12:05:58.318Z,Ameer Robinson,So this place overall gets three stars because even though the service was exemplary inside the service outside with subpar and left nothing to be desired and ultimately they have the judged on the entire experience so that's why it's getting three stars. CRoom was awesome. Pool was awesome again. Service desk concierge all awesome but the beach service simply stated sucks.  The customer service skills are lacking.  Maybe it's because they just get paid on tips. Who knows. We bought a total of three umbrellas with chairs and didn't have a server come to us until we were about to leave and ask us if we wanted anything as we were actively packing up.

1.0,2022-05-29T21:57:46.025Z,Jonathan Friedopfer,"Quick drive from Atlanta. Fun place with table games and slots which pay out well!

Update- returned and absolutely did not enjoy. After visiting many random casinos around the country and then returning I realized that the slots are outdated as well as very tight. I never expect to win however I do expect to be entertained and have fun. Additionally, all the tables had minimum $25 bets with some at $100 min. I'll happily bet $25-$100 when I'm feeling it however mandatory on every bet can drain your stack fairly quick.

The atmosphere is also dull. I enjoy the other location in cherokee a lot more.

Back to slots. Many make you hit max bet for chance to get progressive. 90% don't have any cool bonus features. The few which  have features like spin wheel or free games rarely hit. Even if a bonus feature only wins $1 at at least gives some excitement.  This place is supposed to be fun and exciting. Additionally, most times the slots are full so very few options to even pick from to play.
Why do random casinos like in Iowa, wendover- NV, FL, CT, etc  all have new fun exciting games with bonuses, freeplay, bonus side games, etc and not here. Why do all these other places allow to hit progressives on any bet? Why do they have better music, comps, atmosphere, etc?

1.0,2023-03-01T17:38:56.946Z,Derek Fernandez,What an absolutely awful experience. We go to a 10 cent slot machine and end up spinning 3 times. We cashed out after 3 spins just to go and play a little bit in other areas and got $2.50 back. We asked for help because we assumed machine error as we had only spun 3 times. It’s advertised on the machine that it is a 10 cent machine but somehow we had made the first two spins cost 37$ and the 3rd another $22. We were pointed to the credits area on the screen and told that credits were stacks of 10 cents and that we had selected it on our own…. Wildly unethical and very specifically designed to trick people and steal their money. No attempt to resolve or regain confidence once all was explained.

The room itself was a little sketchy with something growing on the wall, the ceiling was pealing in the corner and was breaking away along the exterior wall. The tub had serious rust stains, and the phone didn't work. That's relevant because I needed to call the front desk when I woke up and found that my car had been broken into.

I had to call on my phone and the front desk just asked what room I was in. They didn't even apologize that this crime had been committed, didn't offer to send someone to clean up the glass, call the cops, anything. And when I checked out they didn't say anything. I received more sympathy from the cops (just filed a report, they didn't send anyone out) and the glass repair company Safelite.

Got a bedbug bites in a room and went to reception at 7am and reception said they will check, but nothing happened and we had to spend one more night  with bed bugs. Went to reception again at 7am next day and had to argue a lot to make them actually come to our room for inspection. Even though hotel saw my bites they didn’t take it serious and told us they have to check and it turns out there are lots of bed bugs. They also didn’t treat out cloth properly and lots of cloths are ruined. Also when we moved to new room, they didn’t follow procedure and bring our suitcase to new room( it has to go to dryer before moving into new room), so we have to change our room again while our luggage went to dry.
The most disappointed part is irresponsibility of their staff. Hotel Manager told us to go to the hospital and he said he will take care of taxi, medicine, and hospital cost. When we came back from the hospital, he disappear and we haven’t got our reimburse yet. Whenever we went to reception to get reimburse hotel staff said their insurance company will reach out to me within 3-4 days but there is no single contact from insurance company after 10days.
Hotel supervisor Joe also told us that they will arrange meeting with their GM (Jim Berkley) as he is only able to make a decision on reimbursement of our medical/transportation and we scheduled the meeting at 12pm. When we arrived at appointment on time, we only hear meeting is canceled after 20mins of waiting. They said they will rearrange the meeting at 2:30pm, so we waited again but GM eventually didn’t appear and we had to spend out time just waiting their GM. This is one of the worst experience of customer support and symbol of irresponsibility of employee.

However, league doesn’t end until 9pm and about 3/4 of the lanes are dedicated to league games. We ended up waiting over and hour to bowl.

Also multiple lanes (many next to each other) were completely open but they wouldn’t allow anyone to bowl next to league games.

It feels like it was a little steep for the price compared to some places we have gone to. But it was still worth it. Had a small issue when we went to get a prize.

The trap museum itself was cool featuring a sizable amount of info, visuals and few facts regarding trap music and a few various artists. The bar area and host/attendant cld definitely use some work as it was clear the gentleman was a little preoccupied. All in all the trap museum itself we enjoyed and wld recommend to those seeking very minimal exposure to trap.

However..

The escape room experience was by far subpar and disappointing!! This was particularly due to its host Johanna! She’s highly unprofessional and rude. I understand she was supposed to be immersive within the trap experience however, she was very rude and offensive on a personal tone. Several of the members within my party felt this way and for this reason we will not visit the escape room again.

Sometimes we didn't even ask.  I really liked the feedback he gave US at the end and how we worked together!  The air quality was accommodating as was everything else.

We did the Gambler room. It was an 8/10 for toughness. It was tough. We did not breakout but were minutes away from doing so.
The clues are great! The staff is helpful.
I feel it's hard for everyone to have a chance at solving when there are that many. It kind of ends up being a few solving everything while the rest stand back feeling like they are in the way.

They will give as many hints as you would like. Only the first requested 3 hints are free though. Anything beyond those 3 result in a 3-minute penalty each. You still get a full hour to break out, no matter how many hints you use. You're time will just look longer than one hour. This is how people get scores of 64 minutes, even though you only have an hour max.

The do give free hints if they see that you're stuck. These do not count against your 3 free requested hints, nor do they penalize your time.

My advice for the uninitiated is to not be afraid to use the hints! Especially if you're not going to try again at a later date. Enjoy the puzzles, but don't let them frustrate you. Make sure someone is keeping track of time so that you can pace the free hints.

The parking was a bit confusing. The building is close to some apartments and there's a few signs that explicitly say ""no parking"" for break out KC. Parking directly in front of the entrance says ""for tenants and patrons only"", which we had no idea what that meant.

Pro: Many fun sites to see and there are a few shows to watch.

The ambient is lousy (loud rock music) but I didn’t feel overwhelmed. Their staff is friendly and courteous. And now with the good stuff.

The staff are super wonderful and do their best to fit the millions of people that want to eat here everyday morning. The food is awesome which explains the wait time if you arrive after 8:30am. The wait is honestly not so bad, especially because you can start sipping your coffee right when you enter and it will just be added to your tab.
There is art for sale hanging all throughout the restaurant from local artists and it changes constantly which provides a fun vibe and a good I Spy game.
This is the first place that I have ever enjoyed Fried Green Tomatoes despite my mother making me try them every year since birth so be sure to order that, you won’t be sorry.
I try to order something different each time I go and I have liked everything!

Whether you want to go to the bar with great local/ regional selections and a chill atmosphere, you want to take the kids someplace affordable to play games (not having to worry about the dreaded prize cabinet) or you just want to take time and REALLY work on your pinball or battle game skills... This place is for you! We love to bring guests or friends here for a night out or just kill some time affordably.

The only things we'd probably improve is the appetizer/ snack offerings to be more kid friendly on weekends, to have an awesome loyalty / membership or 'reserve a machine' type of program (members only early opening or play time would be sweet) and a better window covering near the pinball machines to reduce glare during the day (or move them in the back again/ get a bigger place)...

You are not allowed to bring in your own cooking items or even a hotplate. I could probably fit one can of chunky soup into three of the paper bowls provided. fridge size is what you would expect in a dorm room. previous reviews mention coupons everyday to the restaurant at the casino, I was not informed of this upon checking in and was never offered a coupon my whole stay. I stayed almost a full week before I caved and had my boss switch me hotels... I will never be back!! I honestly do not understand what makes this the second most expensive place to stay in Swift Current, would probably have a better/similar time in a dingy $50 motel. Most furniture in the room was damaged but that was the least of my issues ~!!

 Straightforward rooms come with flat-screen TVs and desks, plus stereos, minifridges and coffeemakers.

The museum is dedicated to the Steamboat Arabia that sunk in the Missouri River during the 1850's. This boat was stocked and loaded with supplies ready to populate a growing town across the river in Nebraska. After the ship sank, it was lost for more than a hundred years until found by a group of family members and their friends who now run the museum. Today, you can view all unblemished materials of the ship ranging from boots, hats and farm tools to European Jewlry, Perfumes and bottles of whisky that are still drinkable.

The outside and interior is in good condition.

My non-smoking room was on the third floor, was in good condition and didn't smell. However, the elevator and the entire 3rd floor smelled like cigarette smoke. The closet was tiny, but there were plenty of drawers in the dresser.

The room had plenty of room to walk around in and for a couple of people to sit comfortably. I had a king size bed and it was very comfortable.

Breakfast was alright. I had sausage patties, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy and a waffle with coffee and oj. Coffee tasted like flavored water. They also had apple juice, toast, bagels, cereal and oatmeal.

We did not feel comfortable there not knowing if they even changed the sheets.  Instead of relaxing, we had to leave shortly after for our concert.  After we complained in the morning, the front desk lady asked us ""What kind of crust spot was it?"" in lieu of an apology.  I asked her how we were to know and why it mattered.

I was un easy the remainder of my stay and had to do alot of mental conditioning to get past what i seen even after switching rooms... I'm a super visual person and once i see something its difficult to un see. I will not be back and wish like hell I could atleast get half of my money back for the major inconvenience. For this to not have been discovered tells me someone is not doing their job or fair share here. Thanks but no thanks Days Inn. When I visit it's for weeks to a month at a time so I take my booking seriously for the safety and comfort of my family above all else. This was unacceptable. And it was kinda just brushed over as if this was a normal complaint.

Cons: EXPENSIVE! Understand before you go that tickets for just outside activities are $30 per person... For 2 hours. That's $120 for a family of 4. Want to play a doubt of mini golf? That's not included... That's another $18... Per person. So now you're up to $200. Wanna try laser tag?it's very fun, but also not included.

Your kids will want to play the arcade games to win tickets, you can buy game passes for a time limit.

During fully open operation and during the summer it is *crowded* so lines are long so be prepared to wait.

Bottom line - kids will have a blast, go on off-peak days if you can, look online or ask about packages for activities and games, and be prepared to shell out a lot of money for the afternoon; if you're not ready to either drop a couple hundred bucks or disappoint the kids by telling them ""no"" then maybe come back a different time.",Hinkle Fun Center,,"Family recreation spot featuring bumper cars, laser tag, paintball & more along with an arcade.",,4.4,11.0,True,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaEppWGpBRRAB,Amusement center,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCltabjNCyLvbb3_9NILsQYFXghdXfJlUSJLfw=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuzGWmvQohHP8cPa4yYabmBAQNflVbvLqFtbX4=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaEppWGpBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x412edc9effd42a9e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDqhJiXjAE%7CCgwIyfrnhgYQsMbajQE%7C?hl=en-US,107238146596747514590,93.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5QfMXh1ck3MWoxsiJnLCWk2U3XBnUejCRT3VvVZgQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107238146596747514590?hl=en-US,2249,2023-03-26T11:04:01.183Z,New Mexico,12931 Indian School Rd NE,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hinkle+Fun+Center/@35.0821683,-106.8165631,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8718a04616bd7ba3:0x412edc9effd42a9e!8m2!3d35.0955452!4d-106.4982381!16s%2Fg%2F1tyt5tdn?hl=en",https://www.hinklefuncenter.com/,Amusement center,,,Amusement center,activity,"[('cons', 0.448), ('pros', 0.3603), ('arcade', 0.2601), ('fun', 0.2242), ('activities', 0.218)]","['cons', 'pros', 'arcade', 'fun', 'activities']","[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4339221715927124}]",,real,ChIJo3u9FkagGIcRnirU_57cLkE

I brought 8, and was told this special must be purchased in advance, and used between 5/1 & 6/1/19, no exceptions. The male employee ails started, he'd had a few customers the day before who wanted the discount as well, and he had to figure out how to get to the page that states it's online only! Having a large family, attending these establishments is difficult, not affordable, and discouraging when these discounts are misrepresenting the company without clicking farther into the website. Purchased the packs this time, but will not be doing this again in the future!

Chill out with this sweet deal available 4/25-4/29/19 only.

4.0,2019-06-02T16:49:13.134Z,ayden stacy,"I liked Hinkle because of the Go-Karts and the Lazer Tag. Basically, those are the two main attractions. As for price, it is a bit expensive for the limited variety of stuff to do, and the all day ride pass doesn't include any of the arcade games that make up half of each facility. It really peeves me how much they govern the Go-Karts, they are great and full of potential, but nobody is allowed to use that full potential. The track is more than big enough to allow the riders to go a bit faster, and honestly it is kinda boring unless you are in a grouped up few cars and it is a true race. I think it would be good for business if you guys implimented an 8 car race of ungoverned Karts, only for people over 16 with a valid license, every hour or so. It would also be good to have a more competitive style of Lazer Tag, rather than the typical ""everyone goes to their team, then when it starts we all basically go to each other's base and destroy it and its pretty much whoever kills it the most wins, very sub par.""",Hinkle Fun Center,,"Family recreation spot featuring bumper cars, laser tag, paintball & more along with an arcade.",,4.4,0.0,True,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0eE42MWdBRRAB,Amusement center,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUR2Db56tjzxjJIibT1BMaUC4NiPq7QGHmbjM5=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpuKpSNMyyFQ4PTIknYYKPloZM4uP3mdipj0Vs=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWOUtagHY7Dhs0gyj715pXv5oab7MANKkr622Q=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0eE42MWdBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x412edc9effd42a9e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC4xN61gAE%7CCgsIifzP5wUQyJCDQA%7C?hl=en-US,105793795032808785282,5.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5Sa4SS1_TbUrf-gULFm9yqKuVYf8Gm20YyGI-meMA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105793795032808785282?hl=en-US,2249,2023-03-26T11:04:01.183Z,New Mexico,12931 Indian School Rd NE,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hinkle+Fun+Center/@35.0821683,-106.8165631,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8718a04616bd7ba3:0x412edc9effd42a9e!8m2!3d35.0955452!4d-106.4982381!16s%2Fg%2F1tyt5tdn?hl=en",https://www.hinklefuncenter.com/,Amusement center,,,Amusement center,activity,"[('hinkle', 0.4124), ('attractions', 0.3968), ('karts', 0.372), ('ride', 0.2584), ('arcade', 0.2325)]","['hinkle', 'attractions', 'karts', 'ride', 'arcade']","[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4851750135421753}]",,real,ChIJo3u9FkagGIcRnirU_57cLkE

The patio furniture is run down and the fire ants bite- don’t take your shoes off !!

Nothing huge but worth mentioning.  The private beach is directly behind the hotel and easy to get back and forth. Multiple places to eat and all were on par with the resort.  Several other upscale amenities, activities and services are available consistent with other Hilton resorts. Another bonus is they provide shuttle service to Baytown Wharf which is close to the resort, among other places.

We have been together for 4 and a half years and now engaged and have a beautiful 9 month old baby girl. At this place I met friends and made family the connections you make just by visiting this place are amazing even if it is just to watch a movie because the employees are always happy the theaters are always clean and you are guaranteed to make memories so don’t forget to capture them.😌,Cinemark 20 and XD,,"Chain of movie theaters, some with multiple screens, stadium seats & self-service ticketing kiosks.",,4.4,12.0,True,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxeHEteHpnRRAB,Movie theater,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOH54W83rRC3WUrW93lRmF90DXVwo7U7tAFVDer=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNY4fo7xlJzqIRZlusj0PKdK9p-JOU84fO0VFPr=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNchT4GPPisR1NgPNF82zPy7T2JCMbM_XquQo7z=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMETssFybkU2zCPeYucxzk0kt70jrEAqEhnbbDh=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuhnSfUk8gF-grBdEeyaZYRfjH-SiSXxKyuVpo=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7VS7Hu1EWow1VdwjnW8r5epPwhQ6pnrgU02Pa=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFfHsX8f8o9enDWRCEFtvOFTMzoEE3YCWOdqfy=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPA4Js_JaBz4WpZiepIvGqItdF8batdktZPAaTx=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPutwkZ_N0quWkIrLw2zTDebMKwZm7fK7VUf5h=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTrYfmlOpYvFiQYmyUmcQMUqZfJ1ixRnhKdWA0=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxeHEteHpnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x3a2ef4996d777502!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDqxq-xzgE%7CCgwI1p2UhwYQkITV0gM%7C?hl=en-US,105630764307482087811,103.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SkKXWbvFD0qKx12aS1bpcdHqdsLj7rucMadCgabQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105630764307482087811?hl=en-US,3954,2023-03-26T11:01:01.874Z,Kansas,5500 Antioch Dr,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Cinemark+20+and+XD/@39.0236396,-94.753853,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x87a17ea7f88622a3:0x3a2ef4996d777502!8m2!3d39.0290037!4d-94.6879504!16s%2Fg%2F11b708kjw8?hl=en",https://www.cinemark.com/theatres/ks-merriam/cinemark-20-and-xd?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=gmb&utm_campaign=local_listing_theater&utm_content=GMB_listing&y_source=1_MTc0OTMxNDYtNzE1LWxvY2F0aW9uLndlYnNpdGU%3D,Movie theater,Snack bar,,Movie theater,activity,"[('theaters', 0.3763), ('theater', 0.3356), ('place', 0.2951), ('visiting', 0.2924), ('employees', 0.2243)]","['theaters', 'theater', 'place', 'visiting', 'employees']","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6120910048484802}]",,real,ChIJoyKG-Kd-oYcRAnV3bZn0Ljo

3.0,2022-08-01T01:56:37.314Z,Lauren Stewart,The ambiance was very romantic for our wedding anniversary. The server was also very nice and helpful with the menu. I got the fillet 4oz combo with 3 bourbon maple shrimp. I was underwhelmed when I saw how small the steak looked and it was well done not medium. It was also dry and needed a sauce. The shrimp was flavorful and tasty. The sides were good but nothing to rave about. My husband got the cajan spiced pan roasted fillet which was seasoned nicely but was very clean..small portions all around. The au gratin was lukewarm and the mushroom was on top of the steak and not really a side. The dessert of the 7 layer coconut cake was very moist and good but I don't care for the passion fruit coulis.,J.

We ordered the chicken tenders as an appetizer, with the delicious plum BBQ sauce, made in-house.  As much as I wanted prime rib, I settled for steak tacos and my partner ordered crabcakes.  We watched the food going out to the tables, every item seemed to be on a large plate and looked amazing.

Our service was paced perfectly, and we were happy with all items. So much flavor, very tender, and plenty of it.  Even the lemonade was fresh and delish.

We will be back. Loved it!  Although we are staying at a hotel, I included a pic of the foil wrapped taco and bag of ice from the hotel, since we are in a room without a fridge.

1.0,2018-10-02T12:36:21.928Z,Ash C,"1 star for a subpar/gross experience at Chicago Getaway Hostel. I rented a private room for 3 nights looking for a clean/decent place to sleep and shower while I was in the city for a work project. Chicago Getaway Hostel did not fit the bill.

The Hostel is in a beautiful Lincoln Park neighborhood with tons of giant trees and you really can't find a better location to get the LP vibe but then walk a block to hop on trains/buses. The cost for a private room is comparable to a hotel room, but I chose this place because it's location was within walking distance to where I was going to be working. After looking at reviews and photos of the hostel, it seemed like a very modern and clean place that I would be comfortable staying at... unfortunately the photos were deceiving and the reviews did not represent my experience.

When I walked up to the building, I had to walk through a crowd of people gathering on the sidewalk outside the hostel smoking (great for my asthma) to enter the building. This happened every time I entered/exited the building over the next few days, which was a real turn off to me. The check in process was quick - the person checking me in rushed through all of the instructions and gave me no written document that verified what he went over, so that was fun.

My room looked nice at first glance - 2 bunk beds, a desk, shower/toilet/sink. All the essentials. Upon further investigation here's what I found (some photos attached)... the bathroom was absolutely disgusting. I don't know when it was last cleaned, but it had to have been a long time. The amount of dirt/grime built up in that shower made me feel dirtier than I was when I walked in. One shouldn't have to buy flip flops to shower in a private room bathroom they rented. There was buildup ON THE SHOWER HEAD where the clean water is supposed to come out of but there was nastiness caked on so it passed through that first.

The beds were pretty uncomfortable. The mattress was very thin and I could feel the bars through it, so it was rough sleeping. A majority of the linens had a ton of stains/loose hairs on them (especially the pillows) and they were very rough in texture. All of this combined made me feel very gross and like the room hadn't been cleaned at all. For the price of a hotel room I'd expect a much higher level of cleanliness from this place.

Needless to say, I will not be back.",Chicago Getaway Hostel,,"Vibrant, modern hostel with dormitory & private rooms, plus a guest kitchen, free breakfast & WiFi.",1-star hotel,4.1,0.0,True,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBX0pyaTNnRRAB,Hostel,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVHBocKpYgIfkuqQocbpequ1nmlV_aHoNMgctm=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGBZ4KoSDjWafS2AP9umOC-Qa5WC4QtakyClYi=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCgVIkgklQss-62dfcA-J6L5MNxOrWbyv4jBO3=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtt-HTpcJ5g0WuvVyCS95oLGj-knaK2pkqL1XJ=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBX0pyaTNnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xe7048c084e9305f!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICA_Jri3gE%7CCgwIxczN3QUQqO_NugM%7C?hl=en-US,104433012677603482894,60.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5QCvkQfOxKksKcyUrOK8_ra32a9EwsDeIlR_euFvg=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104433012677603482894?hl=en-US,1980,2023-03-26T11:27:46.614Z,Illinois,616 W Arlington Pl,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Chicago+Getaway+Hostel/@41.9268713,-87.6796144,14z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x880fd30e41afb9ab:0xe7048c084e9305f!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d41.9268713!4d-87.6445955!16s%2Fg%2F1tg2l7zx?hl=en",http://www.getawayhostel.com/,Hostel,Extended stay hotel,Guest house,Hostel,hotel,"[('hostel', 0.4692), ('hotel', 0.411), ('cleanliness', 0.3681), ('clean', 0.3169), ('room', 0.3168)]","['hostel', 'hotel', 'cleanliness', 'clean', 'room']",,,real,ChIJq7mvQQ7TD4gRXzDphMBIcA4

First time staying at a hostel and I was a bit disappointed. The room was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, it was for three people and it got a bit cramped. It was the private one and almost costed $400.

The parking was a big issue for us since we didn’t get a chance to pay for the parking at the hostel. Eventually we found a lot to park in a few minutes away.

The bathrooms were okay, they were clean which was nice.

My sister got the breakfast and did not enjoy it.

The person at the front counter was nice.

I was shocked because we expect so much more from a Marriott. I called and asked for the room to be cleaned while we were gone for a few hours, telling them that the floor was really dirty and the phone had so much dust on it it appeared it hadn't been cleaned in a very long time (just to give them some examples of the problems.) When we came back, it was clear someone had wiped down the phone briefly and swept the tile floor in the doorway, but the room was still filthy. I called again and let them know, and to their credit, they upgraded us to a much nicer much cleaner room. And I wasn't allergic to this room which was visibly less dusty and dirty.
We were thankful for the upgrade, but it should have never been necessary. I shouldn't walk into a room in a Marriott property to find it so dirty.

When we got in the room we noticed there was a cabinet for a refrigerator, but no refrigerator. I called the desk and was asked if I requested one. I told her no, that I didn't think I had to since EVERY hotel I've stayed in for the last 25 or more years had one in the room. I take prescription medication that must be refrigerated. I explained that to her. She said she would notify housekeeping. Several hours later I went to the desk and asked again, stressing my need for a refrigerator, again explaining my situation. We stayed for 2 nights and never got a refrigerator. I guess i should be grateful there was an ice bucket. Hopefully it didn't compromise the effectiveness of my prescription.
In addition, there was no microwave.
When we returned to our room the housekeeper was at the end of the hall.
There was a pile of dirty towels outside our room. We went out and when we returned hours later the housekeeper was gone but the pile of towels were still there.

Checked in easily. But the key card stopped working when we left the room the first time and had to come back twice to get a replacement.
We weren't told to keep our phones away from the card until the third replacement.
We left for 3 hours and turned the AC down while gone.  Came back and the room was so hot we almost threw up packing up our stuff.
They then gave us a different room after we had to carry everything which took us 2 trips the first time down to the lobby back to the 5th floor. They did give us free breakfast for the inconvenience but would of been nice if they could of met us on the floor instead of 2 trips down to get the room and 1 trip with the luggage cart up.
Breakfast was so so half of the buffet was kinda cold. Wouldn't pay for it so for a free breakfast it's decent.
They also didn't explain any charges so I had a mini panic attacks that they charged me an extra 100 for my room only to go down and have the free explained

This facility far exceeded my expectations. The dressing rooms and facility itself was clean and updated. It was $35 for all three of us (out of city residents) to swim/play all day which isn't even one ticket at other water parks. We have been to our fair share of water parks, splash pads, etc. and I have never experienced lifeguards and staff remain so continuously attentive and alert in their positions. Not once did I see a lifeguard distracted by their cell phones, talking to each other, nothing of the sort. I noticed the staff rotated positions frequently, took safety checks in their zones, and were quick to act in situations to prevent accidents or injury. As a parent, I value and appreciate these proactive practices so much. I would definitely recommend this place and will return in the future.",Ray’s Splash Planet,,,,4.3,26.0,False,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMXNLdVl3EAE,Water park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHrw1NRtTTeMVvsFB90S_giMt-8vy6s4iU62Wt=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMXNLdVl3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xc0d259f4f4d01197!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICm1sKuYw%7CCgwIo7WmkgYQkJK9lgI%7C?hl=en-US,101951939857270341091,4.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5TKDr8_qiPaQeCO1K5gJzosoSuSzfuqkZEdofwhCA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101951939857270341091?hl=en-US,164,2023-03-26T11:05:37.184Z,North Carolina,215 N Sycamore St,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Ray%E2%80%99s+Splash+Planet/@35.2366041,-80.9576989,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8856a1095a1f7daf:0xc0d259f4f4d01197!8m2!3d35.2381165!4d-80.8513028!16s%2Fm%2F0j63rx6?hl=en",https://www.mecknc.gov/ParkandRec/Aquatics/RaysSplashPlanet/Pages/default.aspx,Water park,,,Water park,activity,"[('lifeguards', 0.4902), ('lifeguard', 0.4179), ('swim', 0.3517), ('splash', 0.3478), ('parks', 0.2992)]","['lifeguards', 'lifeguard', 'swim', 'splash', 'parks']","[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4300609827041626}]",,real,ChIJr30fWgmhVogRlxHQ9PRZ0sA

My wife and I shared the deviled eggs and they were pretty good. We enjoyed a Moscow Mule and a Mojito. I had prime rib and it was cooked perfectly.

Our waiter did a great job taking care of us and giving recommendations. We started with appetizers of meatballs, Pear Bruschetta and Salmon Crudo. It was a great way to start off our meal. For entrees we had Rigatoni Bolognese, Tuscan Chicken and Salmon. We shared bites and I would order any of  the other items next time I come here. I enjoyed the hand made pasta and you could tell they paid attention to details. The dessert was Tiramisu and it was ok, nothing special. Their wine and beer selection is decent. Overall, a great dinner and I recommend  to come with some friends and the night will be memorable.

This is definitely the new hot place to have your reception and ceremony!  They have the perfect ceremony area outside with an altar ready to go.  A perfect view of the lake right from the ballroom caps off the evening.  The staff is excellent, friendly, and very attentive.  A special thanks to Nicole who took care of us all night and made sure we had everything we needed from load in to load out.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS NEW AWESOME VENUE!

TECH TIPS FOR ENTERTAINERS... Make sure you leave extra time for a load in... There is some distance from the front door to the ballroom.  Also bring extension cords in case you need to split your power requirements between two breakers.  There is only one main outlet behind the staging area.  I ran the other cord outside to the outlet where I set up to do the ceremony.  You're going to need a 100-footer to get you back to the main setup inside.  The acoustics in the room are great, and they have full control over dimming the can lights in the ceiling and also the chandeliers over each section.   - Joey",Bridges Bay Resort,,Simple rooms & condos in a laid-back resort with a restaurant & an indoor water park.,3-star hotel,4.2,0.0,True,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjN2Q3cXlRRRAB,Resort hotel,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPixLvsH59ljXdbua-KGaNh-V9u4zm1ZTz-fgp=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjN2Q3cXlRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x4491ecda9765844c!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDc7d7qyQE%7CCgwIho2m9wUQsMH-xAI%7C?hl=en-US,108569797938341275147,323.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5TKjY79UVuBXTUjkowTtPTInrIFKiShzKTaGoRWdL4=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108569797938341275147?hl=en-US,1321,2023-03-26T11:31:08.445Z,Iowa,630 Linden Dr,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Bridges+Bay+Resort/@44.9761288,-97.7578315,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x878cb58ab7c398b1:0x4491ecda9765844c!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d43.3722187!4d-95.114175!16s%2Fg%2F1tf7smth?hl=en",http://www.bridgesbayresort.com/?utm_source=GMBlisting&utm_medium=organic,Resort hotel,Hotel,Indoor lodging,Resort hotel,hotel,"[('ballroom', 0.4259), ('venue', 0.424), ('ceremony', 0.3759), ('brides', 0.3561), ('lake', 0.2873)]","['ballroom', 'venue', 'ceremony', 'brides', 'lake']","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.34966278076171875}]",,real,ChIJsZjDt4q1jIcRTIRll9rskUQ

Quiet, relaxing, with an incredible television. Large king size bed was extremely easy to snuggle in and get awesome sleep. Water park passes (located in the other resort building) were included with our room price, but we did not have a need for those. There is no price adjustment if you do not need or use water park passes.  Also be aware: the water views are most definitely disappointing due to the building structures built between the hotel and the lake, obstructing the quality of the vacationer's view (and the roof air conditioning units constantly running in front of our rooms) but we adjusted.

4.0,2022-06-18T20:04:55.477Z,Kim Taylor,"I'm visiting here from Delaware, and I wasn't sure what to expect since the existing reviews are nowhere near consistent. I booked the hotel room through Agoda based solely on the fact that it was a very short (and safe) walk to Oven's Auditorium where my granddaughter's graduation from Hawthorne Academy was scheduled to take place. Overall, I am happy with the room. While it's far from the best place I've ever stayed, and the main elevator has been out of order the entire time I've been here, it has still been an enjoyable stay. The two photos that accompany my review are my photos taken with my Moto phone, not stock photos. My room was very clean upon my arrival. While the furniture was a little dated with a scuff here and there, everything was functional. A little Old English Scratch Cover would definitely make a huge difference in the existing furniture. That said, would I stay here again? Absolutely. The staff was very friendly. They offered me the use of their service elevator to go back and forth to my third floor room, which I thought was really nice since I'm almost 67 years old, and I don't particularly like flights of stairs. The only real disappointment was the fact that the hotel restaurant was permanently closed. Perhaps it was a victim of Covid. I'm not sure. There is a circa 1955 burger establishment almost directly across the highway, but you cannot walk there unless you want to take your life in your hands crossing the very busy highway. I wouldn't try it even if I were Usain Bolt in his prime. But I did drive there, and it only took me about 5 minutes using Google Go directions. (Their Ribeye sandwich was the best I've ever eaten.)  So yeah, I would definitely stay here again. It is ranked as a 3-star hotel, and I give it 4 stars myself because I felt very safe here, and they went out of their way to accommodate me. I will say that if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. Like any other hotel or motel on a busy highway, there is traffic noise at night. The sound of the running AC unit helps, but the foam earplugs really shut it out. ⭐⭐⭐⭐",Golden Green Hotel Daily & Extended Stay - Loving Hut Vegan Restaurant,,"Set off Route 74 and Highway 27, this modest hotel is a block from Bojangles Coliseum and 4.4 miles from Bank of America Stadium.

First I was told when I booked I can have a early check in with a confirmation that it would not be a problem. I get there and I'm told I can't check in until 3. Why not contact me ahead of time so I could made arrangements at the another hotel. I had to be in lake norman by 3 which is why the early check in was needed. They only had a double available and charged me $10 extra didn't even offer the same price due to the inconvenience. SMH. On top of that the elevator didn't work and my room was on the 6th floor. Complete bs. And the room..omg look at the pics. Pub hair on the folded towel. So you know what that means 🤮 the only decent thing was the TV they need to revamp that hotel by the pics you see it needs a major major upgrade.  The area wasn't bad. I seen a couple shady lookin characters but nothing to say the area was bad. I want my money back for real.

The evening staff was super friendly! Every time I went past the lobby, they greeted me like old friends. When I was in the gift shoppe area, we chatted and laughed. They were super accommodating.

The room was great! The furniture was really cool and unique in the King Studio. The side view room shows the parking garage of the hotel next door, but if you stand on the balcony and look left, you have a great view of the beach. To the right, trees everywhere past the shopping center.

The hotel was really clean everywhere, including the public restrooms by the lobby. The breakfast area has a beautiful view of the Gulf.

My only con: I've just now noticed that at all different Hamptons I've stayed in, they all seem to have really bad pillows. Like, you can ball them up, or drape them over your arm almost like a towel. They go flat as soon as you lay your head down. Now, I just bring a small but firm travel pillow to put under the 2 already on the bed.

Well tasting the Mahbarawi is the first time that I cried from food being that good. I generally don't trust restaurants that only have five reviews, where all five are four or five stars, and most of them come from reviewers with little to no reviews. Well, I'm glad that I took the risk. For less than $20 I enjoyed one of the best meals of my life, with a lovely cup of tea, and service as good as one could hope for. They customized the spice level for me, and the cabbage, potatoes, beets, lentils, and greens perfectly balanced the spiciness of the meat. The flavors, the texture, the presentation, were all a symphony to the senses. If I lived in the area, I would eat here at least once a week.

The food was absolutely delicious, and the price was very fair, especially considering that we ordered a platter for four people and couldn't even finish it! My friend really enjoyed the mango smoothie, but I found it a bit too sweet and heavy. The one downside was that the restaurant was very busy, and they occasionally forgot to bring our additional orders. Also, they charged us the wrong amount, so it's important to double-check your tab during checkout.
