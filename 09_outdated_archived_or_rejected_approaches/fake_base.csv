Very niche complaint here, I know, but this is so frustrating. Aside from some of the games being broken (some for several months now), new games like Music Diver end up lagging.

But one thing that could easily be fixed is removing the acrylic plates keeping people from scanning their cards or putting in their PIN numbers on the touch screen. Part of the appeal of these games is the ability to save progress (that's what keeps me coming back), but these silly shields protecting the cabinets are in the way.

If possible, go during the WEEKDAY for Unlimited bowl until 5pm for $11.99. I've hurt my arms & shoulders from bowling way too many games during this inexpensive time and improved my bowling scores.  (Thank you Round 1).

I've enjoyed going to Round 1 to relax and enjoy the oversized Pac-man game and bowl some stress away.  I have not tried the food nor drinks there because I just go in to play games.

Mostly clean, spacious and social distancing  protocols are  in effect.  Team members were constantly cleaning.  My only negative comment is that no one has cleaned the escalator entrance and it looks unwelcoming/unsightly.

The sauce and sour cream didn't make it edible. My partner got the pork burritos. Not allowed to get different meat choices for each burrito without a crazy upcharge so he got all pork. They were pretty bland and the pork was dry but had enough sauce to be edible. The kids were not happy with their food either (hotdog and kids enchilada).

It was opening day so things were bound to go a bit sideways.

Pros:

Kammi our ref - absolutely amazing! She was attentive to the group, very friendly but had no problem calling out safety items the instant someone's mask wasn't all the way down or an uncovered barrell. She was great and I highly recommend you request her if you are taking a group.

The different games fields were fun and challenging. Our group had seasoned vets and first time adults and teens so it was well balanced. Kammi started us out easy and then introduced respawns and play until you're out of paint which everyone loved.

The field paint quality was really good in my opinion. Very consistent and I wish I had a marker that could really sling it.

The whole staff was friendly and went above and beyond to ensure everyone was safe and having fun.

Cons:

The hiccups of opening day with any business, but the owner and his team took it in stride and powered through.

Ran out of air so they were transporting tanks back and forth. Also ran out of cases of paint but that too was resolved with a trip the their warehouse.  These two items didn't affect our play or the amount of fun we had.

The rental markers were all over the place. Different models, broken detents, etc.  Once again - opening day, but it's on the calendar - clean and check everything weeks in advance. We replaced a few tank o-rings ourselves from our parts kits to save time.

No chronographing of walk on players. The rentals were slow and hot and some walk on teens were definitely pushing 300 fps. That's a safety thing especially with rental masks/lenses and horrible experience for young teens playing for the first time.

I am very glad our group made it down and even with said hiccups we had a blast and will be back in the future.",The Edge Paintball Experience,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMjd5VVZnEAE,Paintball center,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FAKE,ChIJHdE1hIMeBogR8LNOcMnA1wE,

The good: The front desk staff who checked us in was very nice, the front office is very nice, and the shower was very nice. Get the picture?

The bad: this is an old motel that needs updating. The carpets are ripped, the sofa is ripped and covered up with a coverlet rather than replacing it, there is a mirror in front of the sofa rather than a TV to look at, and the bed is old and sagging in the middle. And this is an executive suite!Figure that out. Just look at the pictures.

The very bad: we booked a King executive suite. We were told that someone had already taken that suite and extended their stay. Instead of telling them that we had a reservation and that the motel could move them to another room, we were told that we would be moved to another room. We were given a queen executive suite. No discount. No offer of points. Just a ‚Äúsorry, we can‚Äôt guarantee a room.‚Äù  When we complained, the manager was quite generous (please note that is sarcasm) by giving  us a whole 500 points. Wow-wee!

The very very bad: And they have the nerve to charge over $200 for the room.

PS The microwave was unplugged and that was because it didn‚Äôt work, which I reported to the morning clerk. They don‚Äôt serve breakfast in the motel. You have to go next door to the restaurant and the tip is not included. But honestly, we wished we had skipped breakfast because the cook must‚Äôve had a bad morning and most of the food was not cooked enough - runny eggs although ordered fried hard, hash browns hard on one side/soft on the other, the same with the English muffin.

HOSTS - we came to check in for our reservation at 4:57, we were told that our 5pm table was not ready yet and were asked to wait by the bar. After 10 minutes of no one coming to get us, we went back and asked to be seated.

DRINKS - we got the pink Vanderpump sangria and dirty cowboy, both were good.

FOOD - ordered the Tuna tartare, which was good, but extremely oily. The appetizer came out really fast. For main course we got the Mykonos salad and the Salmon salad, both were average. Brussels sprouts in the Salmon salad tasted burned and unseasoned.

FINAL THOUGHTS - the waiter has asked me to clarify my order three times which was kinda frustrating. I also don‚Äôt understand why we couldn‚Äôt be seated when we were early to a reservation that the restaurant was extremely empty.

Day of check out I ask for itemized list of charges which was at zero.  Couple hours later I receive a revised bill with me owing $259.  Call the resort and literally no one picks up the phone on multiple attempts to try and resolve this issue.

Have to send it to our company event coordinator to see if this will get fixed.

We have lived in Baldwin for 2 years and those years have been pretty rough, we were so lucky to find an apartment in sweet and quiet Baldwin City. We love it here and plan on buying a home. We've experienced quite a few events here but this was our first local restaurant. We were finally able to come to The Wooden Spoke after hearing so much about it and we brought friends from out of town.

What a charming, down-home, relaxed place. The parking lot felt like you were pulling into a old-time drive in, but you get out of your car and reach the door and it feels like you are standing outside of someone's well-loved home. The tables reminded me of my own kitchen tables in my childhood home. I felt comfortable as soon as I sat down. The waitress was extremely attentive, her energy was calm and sincere. Our drink orders were taken immediately, our appetizers came out quickly and the entrees were the best home cooking we all have had in many years.

We ordered the KC strip, the ribeye, the bourban steak and the spoke burger, spoke fries, mash potatoes, the chilli, mozzarella sticks, potato skins, and the wings in this beautiful honey brown sauce that was sweet, spicy, smoky and honestly it was incredible. I love WINGS and these took the trophy from me and my friends!

Our food and plates were hot, the food was fast. All the steaks were cooked as asked, all steaks were medium rare, juicy, delicious and quite big. Burger was done just well and had a classic burger taste.

The alcoholic beverages were delicious and made strong.

My daughter ordered the kids chicken strips and she said they were very good, we loved the fries. The spoke burger was amazing and the mustard tasted homemade. My husband especially loved the chilli. Overall, the food was spectacular. The service was fast and friendly, the environment was clean and comfy. We will definitely be back.

Thank you wooden spoke staff and mad respect and kudos to the Chef who made an unforgettable night full of nostalgic decor, warm and friendly interaction and phenomenal home-cooking! See you again soon!!

,,,"We stopped at a quick one night stop to get some sleep, shower, and back get on the road. It was on the way to where we were headed, so it worked perfectly. Things that need improvement: 1. The thermostat. It was not accurate and as you can see my thermostat said it was 65% humidity, because theirs wasn‚Äôt working and wouldn‚Äôt trigger air on its own. My husband continued to smell mildew every time he walked into the room, I must have missed it the 2 times I walked in. 2. The vent, it could use some cleaning. I am not sure how clean the air we manually forced out of it was.
Good things on why I scored it high: 1. Price was great. 2. Location for us was awesome. 3. It did the job provide a nice firm mattress for us to get some good shut eye. The pillows could have been comfier, but for the price I will not complain! 4. The one person we interacted with at the desk was great. 5. Had a pool, we didn‚Äôt use it but I heard kids were enjoying it when I was checking in. 6. Overall thought things were relatively clean! 7. The bathroom was super cute and had a cool mirror/light. 8. There was a tv, but we didn‚Äôt use it. It was small for some standards, but I didn‚Äôt care as we were actually just using it for sleep.

If you are looking for a quick stop to get some good sleep and this is on the way, would 100% recommend. If you are looking for a fancier vacation hotel I would probably look elsewhere, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the area for fancier hotels.",Wyndham Garden Cross Lanes Charleston,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcnA3SUdREAE,Hotel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FAKE,ChIJNfgnzpjLSIgRqQhRaEHIic4,
,,,"Not a great experience overall. The only redeeming factors about the hotel are the price and the friendly employees. I stayed here while doing business in the area. I figured that swimming in one of 2 pools would be a great way to relax afterwards, especially for the price. Well, it could have definitely been better.

The first thing I noticed about the hotel is the smell of marijuana in the elevator. Then, when I got up to the hotel room, I tried to get in with the key cards they gave me. It took me no less than 10 tries to successfully use this card. I swiped it almost the same way 10 times, and it magically opened on the 10th.

The room itself was somewhat chilly when I got in. I changed the temperature and it started to heat up quickly. But, there was another odd burnt smell coming from the conditioner. It was dirty, too. Breakfast was decent. Food was nothing special, but the guy serving breakfast was awesome. Very friendly, even though I just had some coffee he offered me some freshly cooked food.

The pools were nice. Not too many people at night or during the day. Expect it to be more crowded at 9 pm than at 11 am, though. There were loads of what seemed to be pool algae all around the pool (dark green in color) but the water itself was clean. Good ambiance with the rocks and faux plants. Not too cold or too warm. Decent fitness center, too. Treadmill worked fine, they had dumbbells and a few other strength training machines. Pretty basic and small.

It's a bit tough to sleep during the night. They didn't give any pillows or blankets for the 2nd room with the pull out bed. You can hear everything and I was a bit concerned about a door near my room. People walking in and out all the time and you will surely hear some of that.

All in all, if you want a cheap hotel with 2 pools, this may be the place. The location is pretty convenient and the employees were very friendly. There are some cleanliness, room entrance, and sleeping issues, though.",Wyndham Garden Cross Lanes Charleston,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MlAySVpBEAE,Hotel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FAKE,ChIJNfgnzpjLSIgRqQhRaEHIic4,

We go down to the pool and nephew starts swimming in the pool (there's a women and child there as well.) There's a sign around hot tub saying it's closed so we go ask what the deal is since that was a deciding factor of where we stayed since the nephew was with us. The guy gets kinda rude and says the pool is closed too, but nobody seems to know why. He goes to the pool and puts makeshift sign on the door and tells everyone they need to leave. We go to room, change back into regular clothes, and head downstairs. Upon speaking to the manager apparently the pool is fine but hot tub has a leaking pipe (not what sign says) so it'll remain closed. I'm giving 2 stars rather than 1 because the refund process was pretty seamless.

However, I am extremely disappointed in the manner in which I was charged a $75 late fee checkout from Dawn Lucas. I am an Hilton Honors member and my room was without any heat the entire night. No one checked on the room, despite several inquires. I was freezing and slept for only a few hours. I asked for a late checkout to rest and have never had a problem with late checkouts before, even when hotels are at full occupancy. It wasn't so much the charge that bothered me but rather the manner and attitude I received regarding it. It was unprofessional and came across as extremely rude. Dawn almost seemed to take delight in charging the late fee, something that I felt extremely off putting. For those who see these, I caution you to be aware of their late checkout policies, especially if you are a Hilton Honors member, because I am now less hesitant to book my stay there again. Outside of that, this is a phenomenal hotel. The aforementioned gentleman at the front desk did an excellent job at accommodating all sorts of requests. I cannot say the same for other person mentioned. I hope management takes that into consideration.",Hilton Sandestin Beach Golf Resort & Spa,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZeElpMklnEAE,Resort hotel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FAKE,ChIJV-1X1URZkYgRzpJ29oiz7y4,

Their was not.  It's all one big room.  When you walk in their are bunk beds, (the ceiling was low and the ladder was steep) then a hallway, bathroom ( with no lock on it, by the way) then the bed with a table & sofa ( that turns into a bed) then balcony.   They do have multiple restaurants, but  all of them were pricey.  They did give us a free ice cream, it was pretty good.  Alex who checked us in was very helpful.

They have multiple pools, but if you dont get  out to the lounge chairs by seven your out of luck!  Beachfront was great!  You have to rent chairs & umbrellas for the beach, so we just brought our own.  The hot tub in the indoor pool jets did not work.

The Food court has gotten back into it's groove and the options are plentiful and given a 4 Day 3 night stay we had tried just about everything with no complaints. The main Restaurant was superb, my Steak couldn't have been cooked any better and exactly as I requested. Medium with no seasoning only salt and hint of cracked pepper. This place still has plenty of real table games(it's nice have a real human for a dealer). They still have a mix of virtual table machines but the balance was much better than a lot of other out of the way casino resorts are going. Great selection of slots but still like all the other casinos, they are very tight. The areas for those not able to gamble was open and they had plenty to do to keep them busy. I recommend you check out their website to see all the options and entrainment available to anyone traveling with young people. I seen quite a few on this trip and they seemed quite happy and talkative. In all, we enjoyed this visit but I still miss my Wisconsin favorites. However, this one will definitely grow on you. Enjoy and definitely Good Luck! You'll need it, Lol.

,,,"This post should have been made in March 2021 but the trauma of the night is still a struggle for me.

I had been here once before and had a decent time. We paid extra for VIP and side lot parking. This night that lot was full and we parked on a side lot that was ‚Äúmonitored / guarded.‚Äù We got there and did not do a VIP experience as we had time to kill. It felt like the line did not move and easily an hour after standing in line we made it to the front of the building. We were 4 or 5 groups back and the line completely stopped. Across from us was the VIP line for the front door and they were not permitted to enter either. Several people from both lines would knock and ask questions but were disrespected.

Visitors had purchased tickets online and did not wish to continue to wait. They knocked to see if they could get a date adjustment and still the doors would be slammed in their face. There wasn‚Äôt a special uniform for the workers so when people knocked some would be allowed entry but no one updated the crowd outside. Eventually after a 2 hour wait (from arrival) the security guard shared they were short staffed and had to allow some people to clear out. There was no apology or anything just blatant disrespect to paying customers.

When we arrived and paid to park in the trap museum lot it was early evening and the lot was lit up by sunlight. By the time we finished the museum we came out to night time. The lot we paid to park in was not well lit when we returned to my vehicle. I found my vehicle damaged, articles stolen and when I asked the attendant he radioed a manager as he was too busy and didn‚Äôt know anything happened.

We spoke with the representative or manager who went by the name A1. He did not provide his full name but assured us they would fix my window. This time of evening we could not get anyone out and due to Covid mobile window repairs were limited. Still A1 shared the museum would cover the costs. The police came and took a report along with dusting for fingerprints. The thieves not only broke my window they damaged my glove compartment that had my Glock locked inside of it. They stole work items to include files, electronics and my work laptop. The serial numbers of all of my items were added to the police report.

I am a business owner and could not work for a month as I had to work to replace the electronics, files and missed opportunities to make money as I did not have the tools. I shared this with A1 and a lady named Adlia along with sharing the price point for replacing my window. I submitted all of my receipts for my window, loss work and equipment in hopes they would replace my work electronics as a thank you to a military veteran. It was wishful thinking but they mentioned they were short staffed, they pretended to understand how this interrupted my night and work as well.

They offered to cashapp me $300 for my window and a we are sorry that happened. Window itself was $300 and that did not include emergency installation. This place gave me a real life experience of what it means to support the trap.

They will give as many hints as you would like. Only the first requested 3 hints are free though. Anything beyond those 3 result in a 3-minute penalty each. You still get a full hour to break out, no matter how many hints you use. You're time will just look longer than one hour. This is how people get scores of 64 minutes, even though you only have an hour max.

The do give free hints if they see that you're stuck. These do not count against your 3 free requested hints, nor do they penalize your time.

My advice for the uninitiated is to not be afraid to use the hints! Especially if you're not going to try again at a later date. Enjoy the puzzles, but don't let them frustrate you. Make sure someone is keeping track of time so that you can pace the free hints.

The parking was a bit confusing. The building is close to some apartments and there's a few signs that explicitly say ""no parking"" for break out KC. Parking directly in front of the entrance says ""for tenants and patrons only"", which we had no idea what that meant.

We both wanted something light and landed on the same thing: the Thai Kai Salad ($16) with chicken, mixed greens, and peanuts tossed in a cilantro vinaigrette with Thai peanut sauce, along with a croissant on the side. It was a great salad and we both enjoyed it because the dressing was flavorful and tangy, had nice pieces of cold-yet-grilled chicken, and we left feeling full.

,,,"1 star for a subpar/gross experience at Chicago Getaway Hostel. I rented a private room for 3 nights looking for a clean/decent place to sleep and shower while I was in the city for a work project. Chicago Getaway Hostel did not fit the bill.

The Hostel is in a beautiful Lincoln Park neighborhood with tons of giant trees and you really can't find a better location to get the LP vibe but then walk a block to hop on trains/buses. The cost for a private room is comparable to a hotel room, but I chose this place because it's location was within walking distance to where I was going to be working. After looking at reviews and photos of the hostel, it seemed like a very modern and clean place that I would be comfortable staying at... unfortunately the photos were deceiving and the reviews did not represent my experience.

When I walked up to the building, I had to walk through a crowd of people gathering on the sidewalk outside the hostel smoking (great for my asthma) to enter the building. This happened every time I entered/exited the building over the next few days, which was a real turn off to me. The check in process was quick - the person checking me in rushed through all of the instructions and gave me no written document that verified what he went over, so that was fun.

My room looked nice at first glance - 2 bunk beds, a desk, shower/toilet/sink. All the essentials. Upon further investigation here's what I found (some photos attached)... the bathroom was absolutely disgusting. I don't know when it was last cleaned, but it had to have been a long time. The amount of dirt/grime built up in that shower made me feel dirtier than I was when I walked in. One shouldn't have to buy flip flops to shower in a private room bathroom they rented. There was buildup ON THE SHOWER HEAD where the clean water is supposed to come out of but there was nastiness caked on so it passed through that first.

The beds were pretty uncomfortable. The mattress was very thin and I could feel the bars through it, so it was rough sleeping. A majority of the linens had a ton of stains/loose hairs on them (especially the pillows) and they were very rough in texture. All of this combined made me feel very gross and like the room hadn't been cleaned at all. For the price of a hotel room I'd expect a much higher level of cleanliness from this place.

Needless to say, I will not be back.",Chicago Getaway Hostel,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBX0pyaTNnRRAB,Hostel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FAKE,ChIJq7mvQQ7TD4gRXzDphMBIcA4,

We were thankful for the upgrade, but it should have never been necessary. I shouldn't walk into a room in a Marriott property to find it so dirty.

I take prescription medication that must be refrigerated. I explained that to her. She said she would notify housekeeping. Several hours later I went to the desk and asked again, stressing my need for a refrigerator, again explaining my situation. We stayed for 2 nights and never got a refrigerator. I guess i should be grateful there was an ice bucket. Hopefully it didn't compromise the effectiveness of my prescription.
In addition, there was no microwave.

While the furniture was a little dated with a scuff here and there, everything was functional. A little Old English Scratch Cover would definitely make a huge difference in the existing furniture. That said, would I stay here again? Absolutely. The staff was very friendly. They offered me the use of their service elevator to go back and forth to my third floor room, which I thought was really nice since I'm almost 67 years old, and I don't particularly like flights of stairs. The only real disappointment was the fact that the hotel restaurant was permanently closed. Perhaps it was a victim of Covid. I'm not sure. There is a circa 1955 burger establishment almost directly across the highway, but you cannot walk there unless you want to take your life in your hands crossing the very busy highway. I wouldn't try it even if I were Usain Bolt in his prime. But I did drive there, and it only took me about 5 minutes using Google Go directions. (Their Ribeye sandwich was the best I've ever eaten.)  So yeah, I would definitely stay here again. It is ranked as a 3-star hotel, and I give it 4 stars myself because I felt very safe here, and they went out of their way to accommodate me. I will say that if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. Like any other hotel or motel on a busy highway, there is traffic noise at night. The sound of the running AC unit helps, but the foam earplugs really shut it out. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",Golden Green Hotel Daily & Extended Stay - Loving Hut Vegan Restaurant,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPazlMYUFREAE,Hotel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FAKE,ChIJt5rvZxcgVIgRDlxWnDWKtHs,

It's a true testament to Yelp that I found this establishment, as it's such a tiny, non-descript building, that I would have driven right by it.",Addis Restaurant,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBbnNHZXJRRRAB,Ethiopian restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FAKE,ChIJy3eBN66LOIgRT-T7mufzz08,
,,,I found this place after my boyfriend was telling me about how much he enjoyed this authentic Ethiopian Resturant that was near OSU campus when he was in college in the early 00s. The food here was amazing. This was a 1st for me and it was so good.  My boyfriend loved the food!!! It was even better than  he remembered. We got the beef chicken mix platter and it was more enough to feed both of us. I also go a coffee ( I will go back just to get a cup togo) and he had a tea ( also amazing)!!,Addis Restaurant,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnLTVuNVRBEAE,Ethiopian restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FAKE,ChIJy3eBN66LOIgRT-T7mufzz08,

,,,I haven't got take out from here in years but I did yesterday and was very disappointed with the portion size I received for 13.00$!!! I drove 17 minutes here because I love there tibs and this is what I received. Seriously???? It looks like somebody just ate half of it and gave me the left overs‚Ä¶ if I am a respectful loyal customer then you guys need to respect your customers too!!!!!! This is very dirty of you guys to treat take out customers like this‚Ä¶ to go orders and dine in orders should be the same portion size!!! Because when I dine it I have never received something like this it always a big portion.This happened to me before too by the way I just forgot to write a review. I will never get take out from here again‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs sad because you guys never did this years ago smh.,Addis Restaurant,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcGNud1NBEAE,Ethiopian restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FAKE,ChIJy3eBN66LOIgRT-T7mufzz08,

,,,"Best Ethiopian food in Columbus. It‚Äôs a lot tastier when the owner is in the kitchen herself.
