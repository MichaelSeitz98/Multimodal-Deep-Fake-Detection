There is a good selection of shooting games, classic stuff like skeeball, fighting games etc.

They also have TONS of crane games, karaoke, a small bowling alley and a snack bar.

My biggest issue is their app is a dumpster fire that doesn’t work, causing you to need to go to the game card counter, which often only has one person working.

I love arcades, and this one blew my mind. A lot of the games are the Japanese versions which is amazing to find, especially in The Land of Enchantment.

I love claw machines(the more challenging the better), and this place has TONS of them.

I purchased a $40 card and after a few arcade tries I went to try a claw.

After about 10 tries my card ran out of money, and I went to go re-load it. While I was gone, the progress that I had made on the item in the machine was re-set by a worker, which led me to a mini-freakout.

Luckily, he saw me and apologized, opened the machine and placed the item back where it was and let me continue. After about six more tries, I won! The key with the Japanese claw machines is PATIENCE.

Very niche complaint here, I know, but this is so frustrating. Aside from some of the games being broken (some for several months now), new games like Music Diver end up lagging.

But one thing that could easily be fixed is removing the acrylic plates keeping people from scanning their cards or putting in their PIN numbers on the touch screen. Part of the appeal of these games is the ability to save progress (that's what keeps me coming back), but these silly shields protecting the cabinets are in the way.

3.0,2022-04-04T08:06:09.427Z,Muneera Abdulmohsen,Definitely not up to dorchester standards. The hotel is nice. I got really disappointed because we booked a suite for 10 days then left and booked the same suite when I came back for another few days. The first suite was extremely tiny it would even be considered small for a room. On the other hand when I came back and booked the same variety they gave me what was supposed to be a suite.

It was tortilla fried like the chips filled with a hard lump of dry chicken. The sauce and sour cream didn't make it edible. My partner got the pork burritos. Not allowed to get different meat choices for each burrito without a crazy upcharge so he got all pork. They were pretty bland and the pork was dry but had enough sauce to be edible.

Totally understandable if you’re in a major rush. It seems that the restaurant is family owned and operated which, to me, is a big plus. If you’re looking for fast food, this is the wrong place. If you’re looking for great food, home style vibes, great culture and a meal that will nourish your soul, come here.

Never heard about or used it before but it seemed it had got nice reviews and ratings on several travel websites. The price was also very good, especially compared to those resorts and cabins inside RMNP (Riding Mountain National Park). These are attractive enough so I decided to give it a try.

I have to tell you that I was not disappointed at all even though I  set my expectation very high. This B&B is right out of the town of Onanole, on a small hill right beside Hwy 10. Only 7km from the entrance of RMNP, you have easy and quick access to the park while still enjoy the quiet and beautiful setting of the B&B. The historic building has been beautifully restored and tastefully decorated. The room feels cozy and the bed is comfortable and supportive. The full breakfast (with bacon, egg/omelette, toasts, fruits, and coffee) was delicious. There are lots of other amenities for the gusts to enjoy, like the huge deck, the lounge room with TV, etc. Too bad I stayed for two nights only and was too busy to fully enjoy them.

We enjoyed the back deck immensely and found ourselves out there every night. While we were there the owners, Cindy and Earl began another project on the grounds, preparing an area for wedding ceremonies to be held. I am certain that is going to be a great addition to the property and well received in the area.

The breakfast service was excellent. As someone that loves to cook, I could easily see the passion that went into the morning meal.

The beds are amazingly comfortable and the sheets are out of this world comfortable. The great news is that you can buy the same sheets and bring home a brand new set for yourself.

the kids loved it.
the wedge salad is soooo fricken good.
went for opening night and it was extra fun with the Dj.

so easy off the freeway.
i was a bit worried when i hear it was on the west side but it's easier than most places in ABQ to get to.
excited to see how their space grows and evolves.

would be a rad spot for pop up spin classes or group fitness classes.....for fund raisers or just fun followed but food and cold beverages.

So you enter a brightly lit room to pay for entry….and then you go into a tunnel of neon lights and immediately are submerged into a neon maze of fun! There are several different activities to enjoy along with a drink station and bar. My son and I went and paid $18 a ticket for a pass for a few hours. Some of the games where really fun and interactive well others where kind of meh. The dodgeball space invader game and the larger than life breakout game where are favorites. The only downsides are it does get crowded and kind of smelly…I mean there’s lots of kids running around sweating 😅 also there isn’t that much to do considering majority of the main events get completed fairly quickly. We where kind of over it after an hour due to all the screaming kids but the initial wow factor is great. We decided to hit the snack bar and I was hoping for an adult beverage but no one would help us. The staff was in the kitchen dancing and the bartender only seemed interested in helping a certain group of people at the bar.

Not only is it a revolving conveyor belt sushi spot (which reminds me of Japan), but it has made to order foods on a self-service kiosk! You also insert your plate in a slot to keep track of your bill and total. You win a little toy prize if you get 15 (probably not worth it, but it's fun!) My only gripe is that this place does not serve very fresh ingredients... the fish quality is mediocre, and I DON'T recommend the Uni on ANY of the rolls.

2.0,2022-10-13T02:48:31.643Z,Michelle Berois,"This hotel is all hype and no substance. If you like ridiculously tiny overpriced rooms with concrete walls then this place is for you. We walked into an 80 degree room because their AC was on the fritz. Didn’t cool down till late at night. One entire wall is a floor to ceiling window so by noon you have to use the blackout shade to keep the room cool. So then it feels like you’re in a prison cell.
Location is great but otherwise too many cons:
- mandatory valet parking at $46/night.
- weak AC and water pressure
- room is so tiny with barely a closet and no dressers so you have no place to put your things. Barely have a place to walk.
- the blackout curtains don’t work properly and suddenly go up and down on their own.
- hotel is on Wilshire so tons of street noise (windows are not sound proofed)
- construction going on next door
- plumbing is terrible
- gym is tiny in relation to the size of this hotel (as well as their pool).

It’s just not worth it for what they charge. Definitely not a place you want to stay at for more than a night or two. The tv is so high and can’t be adjusted to tilt down.

4.0,2022-04-05T03:44:32.388Z,Dean Krapf,"A whole lot to say about our visit.

It was opening day so things were bound to go a bit sideways.

Pros:

Kammi our ref - absolutely amazing! She was attentive to the group, very friendly but had no problem calling out safety items the instant someone's mask wasn't all the way down or an uncovered barrell. She was great and I highly recommend you request her if you are taking a group.

The different games fields were fun and challenging. Our group had seasoned vets and first time adults and teens so it was well balanced. Kammi started us out easy and then introduced respawns and play until you're out of paint which everyone loved.

The field paint quality was really good in my opinion. Very consistent and I wish I had a marker that could really sling it.

The whole staff was friendly and went above and beyond to ensure everyone was safe and having fun.

Cons:

The hiccups of opening day with any business, but the owner and his team took it in stride and powered through.

Ran out of air so they were transporting tanks back and forth. Also ran out of cases of paint but that too was resolved with a trip the their warehouse.  These two items didn't affect our play or the amount of fun we had.

The rental markers were all over the place. Different models, broken detents, etc.  Once again - opening day, but it's on the calendar - clean and check everything weeks in advance. We replaced a few tank o-rings ourselves from our parts kits to save time.

No chronographing of walk on players. The rentals were slow and hot and some walk on teens were definitely pushing 300 fps. That's a safety thing especially with rental masks/lenses and horrible experience for young teens playing for the first time.

I am very glad our group made it down and even with said hiccups we had a blast and will be back in the future.",The Edge Paintball Experience,,,,4.6,2.0,True,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMjd5VVZnEAE,Paintball center,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtFHn_w7ekkZ3pQlTwWf5_sHnttv2167G2xLwT=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPH5nVT8OI9fX8y1t4ddoJLzREWivW9iyLk9Uym=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMjd5VVZnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x1d7c0c9704eb3f0!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDW27yUVg%7CCgwIoPaukgYQwLChuQE%7C?hl=en-US,113737575556195080059,296.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SoolYwEt4KS21sSnH3TMTmR8UCIAQKt8arREpnoA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113737575556195080059?hl=en-US,134,2023-03-26T11:02:50.981Z,Wisconsin,5946 US-51,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/The+Edge+Paintball+Experience/@42.5930271,-90.1429939,9z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x88061e838435d11d:0x1d7c0c9704eb3f0!8m2!3d42.5929872!4d-89.0223799!16s%2Fg%2F12hk1kwtj?hl=en",https://www.608pb.com/,Paintball center,,,Paintball center,activity,"[('cons', 0.3085), ('visit', 0.3083), ('pros', 0.2801), ('fun', 0.2559), ('kits', 0.255)]","['cons', 'visit', 'pros', 'fun', 'kits']","[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.42311805486679077}]",,real,ChIJHdE1hIMeBogR8LNOcMnA1wE

No worries,  it's not like I'm a slob. Went to the housekeeping cart & called out into a room I assumed was being cleaned & nobody answered or was in the room. I put my dirty towels in the bag hanging off the cart & grabbed clean ones & was good to go. No worries.  Put a do not disturb on my door & all was well. My complaint is that there were so many flies in my room when I arrived on the day before. I used a hand towel & killed them all. The a/c filters were filled with lint, like a clothes dryer filter. (The pictures I'm showing here are AFTER I cleaned them). I pulled them out & banged them together outside my door & the lint flew off into the wind. Then I rinsed them off in the shower & dried them & put them back. No worries 👍 sneezing problem solved. Also had to use a hand towl in room 114 to slam in the bottom of the entry door where critters could crawl in from outside.  The insulation on the bottom right corner of the door was missing.  Showerhead had bad water pressure due to corrosion as well & several outlets in the room didn't work. Other than that the place isn't that bad. I'll return for work but bring a flyswatter & clean the a/c filters in the room with each visit.",Best Western Colorado River Inn,,"Located just off Historic Route 66, this laid-back hotel is a mile from both Rivers Edge Golf Course and Needles Marina Park.

2.0,2022-10-07T21:00:00.970Z,Randy M,"Here’s the good and the bad and the very bad.

The good: The front desk staff who checked us in was very nice, the front office is very nice, and the shower was very nice. Get the picture?

The bad: this is an old motel that needs updating. The carpets are ripped, the sofa is ripped and covered up with a coverlet rather than replacing it, there is a mirror in front of the sofa rather than a TV to look at, and the bed is old and sagging in the middle. And this is an executive suite!Figure that out. Just look at the pictures.

The very bad: we booked a King executive suite. We were told that someone had already taken that suite and extended their stay. Instead of telling them that we had a reservation and that the motel could move them to another room, we were told that we would be moved to another room. We were given a queen executive suite. No discount. No offer of points. Just a “sorry, we can’t guarantee a room.”  When we complained, the manager was quite generous (please note that is sarcasm) by giving  us a whole 500 points. Wow-wee!

The very very bad: And they have the nerve to charge over $200 for the room.

PS The microwave was unplugged and that was because it didn’t work, which I reported to the morning clerk. They don’t serve breakfast in the motel. You have to go next door to the restaurant and the tip is not included. But honestly, we wished we had skipped breakfast because the cook must’ve had a bad morning and most of the food was not cooked enough - runny eggs although ordered fried hard, hash browns hard on one side/soft on the other, the same with the English muffin.

I am paranoid about travelling due to the current pandemic, but I didn’t have a worry in the world with how spotless and clean this room was. Felt comfortable, and like home. No dirt, dust bunnies ANYWHERE.

Check in was fast an efficient. This motel could be charging way more than they are for the quality of rooms they provide.

The rooms had pots, pans, dishes, utensils, and whatever else you could need to make yourself a quick meal if you didn’t feel like going out to a nearby restaurant.

The bed was comfy, which is a rare find in most motels. They also has 3 different mattress protectors on the mattress itself, all extremely clean. They provide an additional blanket on top of the shelf as well.

I was also extremely grateful for the working air conditioner, another rare find in motels.

If you are making a cross country drive like I was, I highly recommend planning to stop here for a good nights rest.

(Also I greatly appreciated the little cat feet socks on the chair legs, just adorable.)",Quest Motel,,,,4.7,4.0,True,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4b29EZ093EAE,Motel,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGF5Hja7wiMw_WCXCSMqbLvOwMYqDw_LJQodl1=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2K7bL9eys09Wco5DPmA_4x4Try54WzmQdjGk-=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMYlNcrC1bN1eEVkvXikhEYSiRRQTPwnbt7Nra=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4b29EZ093EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x4fb2d158d60e0e1!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC8ooDgOw%7CCgsIktTi9wUQuJPyEg%7C?hl=en-US,110547249124063660614,34.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5S8BpoE4CZcqLEPe7aR2d1ylovsNd-K-hee3IfX8Q=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110547249124063660614?hl=en-US,209,2023-03-26T11:30:40.830Z,Saskatchewan,913 Service Rd,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Quest+Motel/@49.4677703,-107.8952702,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x52e1a18770802d25:0x4fb2d158d60e0e1!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d50.3355339!4d-102.2634103!16s%2Fg%2F1tcw383_?hl=en",https://instagram.com/questmotel?igshid=ZDdkNTZiNTM=,Motel,,,Motel,hotel,"[('motel', 0.5168), ('motels', 0.4298), ('rooms', 0.3664), ('bed', 0.3278), ('room', 0.3238)]","['motel', 'motels', 'rooms', 'bed', 'room']","[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.38295137882232666}]",,real,ChIJJS2AcIeh4VIR4eBgjRUt-wQ

5.0,2022-10-17T14:44:44.249Z,Russell H,"Oh boy, I am sad that I found this place so late in life.

Probably one the best buffet deals you can find in MN. Piles of aromatic rice pilafs. Really fresh and tasty desserts. Not quite traditional pistachio baklava, but baklava-shaped with creamy gooey ness inside.

There were tons of stews but I really like okra so I downed the okra stew. Also the giant potatoes with sauce was great.

Service was great - down to earth and friendly. The decor is as it should be: diner-like without the fru fru extras. Mostly tables and standard stackable chairs.

Also there are western dishes like spaghetti and meatballs and Mac and cheese for the kids. I didn’t try them bc I got to get my fill of middle eastern foods.

Understand one thing about Marhaba and you will fare much better there: don't expect much from their ""American"" food (looking at you, fried chicken wings). Everything else is very, very good. They do a Mediterranean buffet better than The Marina a few miles north. I didn't think that was possible and here I sit full an so very much corrected.

Things I needed seconds of (some of which I had, some of which I was too full to do again): baklava, catfish, lamb Kafka, tabouleh, gyro meat, meat samosa.

$42 for 2 adults and 2 preschoolers on some mysterious pay per year of the child's age system. So probably somewhere around $15/person with a soda. If the quality of the Mediterranean food wasn't so high, I would have dropped a star for the price. In this case , however, I have nothing to complain about: I feel I received an excellent value food:cost.

The servers are lovely presentations and complement the atmospheric beauty that the decor of Pump offers! The food comes out within excellent timing, is art to the eyes, and tastes just as good as the ""vibes"" you feel just from being there.

Note: If you're getting food at a sit-down table please get seated and wait for your server, don't go to the bar for beverages. I was a server once upon a time and this to me is dining etiquette 101.

Overall, I love this place and as a new ""local"" to the area, I would one day love to meet the owners to thank them for the experience and for creating a place for memories to be made.

Best,

Cory!

5.0,2021-12-18T21:11:51.358Z,Leah Michelle,"We are here last night, December 17th 2021, for my my husband's 28th birthday.

We have lived in Baldwin for 2 years and those years have been pretty rough, we were so lucky to find an apartment in sweet and quiet Baldwin City. We love it here and plan on buying a home. We've experienced quite a few events here but this was our first local restaurant. We were finally able to come to The Wooden Spoke after hearing so much about it and we brought friends from out of town.

What a charming, down-home, relaxed place. The parking lot felt like you were pulling into a old-time drive in, but you get out of your car and reach the door and it feels like you are standing outside of someone's well-loved home. The tables reminded me of my own kitchen tables in my childhood home. I felt comfortable as soon as I sat down. The waitress was extremely attentive, her energy was calm and sincere. Our drink orders were taken immediately, our appetizers came out quickly and the entrees were the best home cooking we all have had in many years.

We ordered the KC strip, the ribeye, the bourban steak and the spoke burger, spoke fries, mash potatoes, the chilli, mozzarella sticks, potato skins, and the wings in this beautiful honey brown sauce that was sweet, spicy, smoky and honestly it was incredible. I love WINGS and these took the trophy from me and my friends!

Our food and plates were hot, the food was fast. All the steaks were cooked as asked, all steaks were medium rare, juicy, delicious and quite big. Burger was done just well and had a classic burger taste.

The alcoholic beverages were delicious and made strong.

My daughter ordered the kids chicken strips and she said they were very good, we loved the fries. The spoke burger was amazing and the mustard tasted homemade. My husband especially loved the chilli. Overall, the food was spectacular. The service was fast and friendly, the environment was clean and comfy. We will definitely be back.

Thank you wooden spoke staff and mad respect and kudos to the Chef who made an unforgettable night full of nostalgic decor, warm and friendly interaction and phenomenal home-cooking! See you again soon!!

3.0,2022-11-07T11:29:27.016Z,Jacqueline Hartman,"We stopped at a quick one night stop to get some sleep, shower, and back get on the road. It was on the way to where we were headed, so it worked perfectly. Things that need improvement: 1. The thermostat. It was not accurate and as you can see my thermostat said it was 65% humidity, because theirs wasn’t working and wouldn’t trigger air on its own. My husband continued to smell mildew every time he walked into the room, I must have missed it the 2 times I walked in. 2. The vent, it could use some cleaning. I am not sure how clean the air we manually forced out of it was.
Good things on why I scored it high: 1. Price was great. 2. Location for us was awesome. 3. It did the job provide a nice firm mattress for us to get some good shut eye. The pillows could have been comfier, but for the price I will not complain! 4. The one person we interacted with at the desk was great. 5. Had a pool, we didn’t use it but I heard kids were enjoying it when I was checking in. 6. Overall thought things were relatively clean! 7. The bathroom was super cute and had a cool mirror/light. 8. There was a tv, but we didn’t use it. It was small for some standards, but I didn’t care as we were actually just using it for sleep.

If you are looking for a quick stop to get some good sleep and this is on the way, would 100% recommend. If you are looking for a fancier vacation hotel I would probably look elsewhere, but I’m not sure if that’s the area for fancier hotels.",Wyndham Garden Cross Lanes Charleston,,"This roadside hotel next to I-64 is a 12-mile drive from Downtown Charleston and 3.5 miles from the West Virginia State University.

2.0,2022-08-12T23:21:45.984Z,Ulyana K,"Not a great experience overall. The only redeeming factors about the hotel are the price and the friendly employees. I stayed here while doing business in the area. I figured that swimming in one of 2 pools would be a great way to relax afterwards, especially for the price. Well, it could have definitely been better.

The first thing I noticed about the hotel is the smell of marijuana in the elevator. Then, when I got up to the hotel room, I tried to get in with the key cards they gave me. It took me no less than 10 tries to successfully use this card. I swiped it almost the same way 10 times, and it magically opened on the 10th.

The room itself was somewhat chilly when I got in. I changed the temperature and it started to heat up quickly. But, there was another odd burnt smell coming from the conditioner. It was dirty, too. Breakfast was decent. Food was nothing special, but the guy serving breakfast was awesome. Very friendly, even though I just had some coffee he offered me some freshly cooked food.

The pools were nice. Not too many people at night or during the day. Expect it to be more crowded at 9 pm than at 11 am, though. There were loads of what seemed to be pool algae all around the pool (dark green in color) but the water itself was clean. Good ambiance with the rocks and faux plants. Not too cold or too warm. Decent fitness center, too. Treadmill worked fine, they had dumbbells and a few other strength training machines. Pretty basic and small.

It's a bit tough to sleep during the night. They didn't give any pillows or blankets for the 2nd room with the pull out bed. You can hear everything and I was a bit concerned about a door near my room. People walking in and out all the time and you will surely hear some of that.

All in all, if you want a cheap hotel with 2 pools, this may be the place. The location is pretty convenient and the employees were very friendly. There are some cleanliness, room entrance, and sleeping issues, though.",Wyndham Garden Cross Lanes Charleston,,"This roadside hotel next to I-64 is a 12-mile drive from Downtown Charleston and 3.5 miles from the West Virginia State University.

Drove there arriving about an hour later, booked room, went to room and changed clothes. We go down to the pool and nephew starts swimming in the pool (there's a women and child there as well.) There's a sign around hot tub saying it's closed so we go ask what the deal is since that was a deciding factor of where we stayed since the nephew was with us. The guy gets kinda rude and says the pool is closed too, but nobody seems to know why. He goes to the pool and puts makeshift sign on the door and tells everyone they need to leave. We go to room, change back into regular clothes, and head downstairs. Upon speaking to the manager apparently the pool is fine but hot tub has a leaking pipe (not what sign says) so it'll remain closed. I'm giving 2 stars rather than 1 because the refund process was pretty seamless. The place looks nice, but being told everything is good, driving almost an hour and checking in to realize it's not, then the lack of communication and poor attitude of the desk worker... ehhh.

Plenty of lounge seating and common space in lobby since they kept the check-in area/front desk small and minimal to make way for more room for amenities. Very nice patio and firepit with views of downtown KC. Decent saltwater pool and hot tub. Asked for corner room since they generally have more space, they were nice enough to oblige upon checkin. Very friendly helpful staff. On the smaller side, family-friendly and near nicer lifestyle shopping centers with dining. The only gripes I had were that walls and floors were very thin and I could hear every footstep and stomps of the family above me at all hours, and every toilet flush. Note that they don't have microwaves in the room (not even for extra deposit) which is understandable and fine for a higher-end hotel, but this was more budget-friendly and family friendly and sometimes that is a godsend if you are traveling with kids.",Courtyard by Marriott Kansas City at Briarcliff,,"Connected to The View at Briarcliff Event Space, this modern hotel is 6 miles from the Sprint Center and 7 miles from the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.

The queso was great and the salsa had a different texture but was good. It’s rare to find places that start you off with free queso. They honestly have the best horchata I’ve had. The food had great flavor and the portions were perfect. The rice was a little dry for my liking, but I typically never eat the rice anyways. Service was great and they had refills ready to go. The pricing was around $10-12 per person, which was well worth it.

Everything is perfect, from the Schnitzel to the Wursts to the spaetzle.  The sauerkraut, and the kartoffelsalat were wonderful as well.  At first glance the menu is pricey but well worth it once you receive your meal. I think the Jaeger Schnitzel sandwich is an absolute winner.

The place in dingy, so be prepared for that; the sign is in disrepair, badly needs paint, the patio section desperately needs to be remodeled, broken down cars out front (as well as a broken down boat). Now, as to the food: pretty good. I got the Rancocas Burger and was generally pretty impressed other than it being overcooked (ordered medium, came out well. I still ate it cause I'm not that annoying about my food). While I could be way off base, it had a sort of lack of flavor that's reminiscent of cheapish frozen beef. Not trying to spread lies if maybe it was just a bit under seasoned but that's what it reminded me of.

1.0,2023-03-01T17:38:56.946Z,Derek Fernandez,What an absolutely awful experience. We go to a 10 cent slot machine and end up spinning 3 times. We cashed out after 3 spins just to go and play a little bit in other areas and got $2.50 back. We asked for help because we assumed machine error as we had only spun 3 times. It’s advertised on the machine that it is a 10 cent machine but somehow we had made the first two spins cost 37$ and the 3rd another $22. We were pointed to the credits area on the screen and told that credits were stacks of 10 cents and that we had selected it on our own…. Wildly unethical and very specifically designed to trick people and steal their money. No attempt to resolve or regain confidence once all was explained. I will never visit any Harrahs again.,Harrah's Cherokee Valley River,,"This basic casino resort is 4 miles from the Cherokee Historical Museum and 5 miles from the Cherokee County Courthouse, which dates from 1926.

1.0,2023-02-28T14:23:00.133Z,Lacey Nolting,"My family of 6 just finished a 5 night stay, to say we were underwhelmed is an understatement. We happen to be a hardworking blue-collar family, so when paying $629.00 a night for a suite at the Hilton, we were really excited to experience a stay that's above average to our typical Redroof or Days Inn stay. At arrival I was declined a military discount, not absolutely a deal breaker as I was told I was already receiving good deal by the front desk. Of course we were in town for a work conference and were also denied the block rate supposedly due to the fact that we had a suite (the only Accessible room available at the time of our reservation). Next, we arrived in our suite and had to use the restroom after our 16 hours of travel, only to find that housekeeping has definitely not done a very thorough job cleaning the toilet. Ok, fine. I pulled out some Clorox wipes and took care of it myself. At the same time, we noticed the room was excessively hot, so after settling in we called the front desk and notified them that the ac was not working, she said she would send an engineer up to check it out. At 230am when we still hadn't seen the engineer, we went to bed leaving the door open for a breeze to cool the room off. (The ac automatically turns off when the patio door is open, this was not the reason our ac was not working as we had complied with troubleshooting from the front desk) It wasn't until 2 more calls to the front desk and almost 2 days into our stay that the ac was worked on and worked at least enough to make the room bearable. Next up....showers, nothing like stepping out of a nice warm steamy shower to briefly look up when drying off and seeing black mold.......gross. Room service was not an option during our stay, a bit of a bummer as the kids were looking forward experiencing that. On the flip side we ended up dining down in the Don Ricos. It was a bit pricey at $14.00 for a pb&j sandwich with fries for the kids, needless to say there are lots of other options outside the Hilton for food choices and we made that choice for the remainder of our stay. The kid zone was non existent, the kids were really bummed about that as it was one of the reasons we had chosen to stay at the Hilton. The elevators were in a state of broken or in repair a couple times during our stay leading to extra long wait times to get to the lobby. We made our reservation for 6, had a suite for 6, paid the additional fee to have breakfast included but were informed it only included 4 so we didn't dine as a family for breakfast.

The good: At check in the kids were all given a fun craft to do, which they did and thoroughly enjoyed. Our request for extra towels and blankets was met quickly and our interactions with the staff were pleasant. The location was great as it's was very central for the things we needed to do. The beach was fantastic even though access was very limited due to damaged walk ways.  Last but most important, the unobstructed view of the ocean from our suite was fantastic.

Lesson learned, we won't be returning.

UPDATE: I called the number provided by the Hiltons response to my review. I was quickly forwarded to the manager on duty without any prolonged holding. Brooke I think, (I hope that's how her name is spelled) spoke with me for about 20 min as I recounted our stay with them and the reasons for my review. She was open to hearing what I had to say and did not discount or deny the experience we had, which was refreshing! At the end of the conversation, she let me know I would receive a partial refund (which I have received). She handled my call with complete professionalism and kindness.",Hilton Daytona Beach Oceanfront Resort,,"This modern beachside hotel is a minute's walk from the Ocean Center convention facility and a 2-minute walk from the Daytona Lagoon waterpark.

CONS:  (none of which merit giving this resort less than 5 stars).  The resort itself is quite dated, so don't expect fancy rooms, but -especially for a beachfront resort- the common areas are in good shape.  Expect to pay exorbitant prices for everything within the resort, as goes with any vacation resort.

TIPS:  I definitely recommend spending the money for valet parking because the self-parking is a good distance away and terribly inconvenient (and isn't that much cheaper).  Try and get a room on the upper floors, beachfront, because the view is great!

I would definitely stay here again!",Hilton Daytona Beach Oceanfront Resort,,"This modern beachside hotel is a minute's walk from the Ocean Center convention facility and a 2-minute walk from the Daytona Lagoon waterpark.

1.0,2022-07-23T19:05:16.094Z,Michael Sellers,"This is a sincere review. If you seriously want to stay here read this. For many reasons i have to give this place 1 star. I'm just going to list them below. If you're like me and plan to be on the beach during the day, have fun at night and supply your own food for all but dinner, this isn't the place for you. If you want to just show up with clothes and a wallet full of money than have at it. Because this place is pretty aggressive at gouging prices.

1. Advertised parking $20, real self parking was $30 per night(not garunteed  parking spots after purchase, and it's 2 blocks away) valet $40.

2. If you get valet, check is super early. A line stretched past the hotel for at least 1.5 miles waiting for parking.

3. It took an hour to check in, (kind of my fault since it was right at 4p.m)

4. No microwave in the room (to make you use the resturaunts)

5. This place is super scammy. Plan to spend at a minimum an extra $45 a night for parking + a $15 charge for using amenities like the pool or gym.

6. Resturaunts they have are super pricey

7. The beach in front of the Hilton is taken up by a predatory beach rental company that charges $30 for 2 hours to use 2 chairs and an umbrella. With barely any room for people who don't want to buy.",Hilton Daytona Beach Oceanfront Resort,,"This modern beachside hotel is a minute's walk from the Ocean Center convention facility and a 2-minute walk from the Daytona Lagoon waterpark.

1.0,2021-11-07T01:14:09.894Z,John Stegman,"Came for the Tuesday deal. Was told it would be 20-30min wait for leagues and parties to end. However, league doesn’t end until 9pm and about 3/4 of the lanes are dedicated to league games. We ended up waiting over and hour to bowl. Our issue is they knew league wouldn’t end until 9 and they gave us a complete unrealistic waiting time. Also multiple lanes (many next to each other) were completely open but they wouldn’t allow anyone to bowl next to league games. This is incredibly frustrating for local patrons who want to take advantage of their weekly deals. So disappointing. Also if you plan to have a night with a lot of people at the bar it would be nice to have more then one bartender to serve drinks took forever to get anything

Starting with the Escape Room, its nearly impossible to solve in the 30 minutes of allotted time given on the weekends without the Escape Room rep (who literally sits in the room with you) barking out all the clues that are pretty much dead giveaways. Its annoying & negates the “escape” part of the experience. If it were not for the fact that booking the Escape Room prevents you from standing in the line that quickly wraps around the building, I would probably skip it all together. As for the actual “museum”, its not really. What you’ll find are scenes that play to familiarities of the “trap” world plus a lot of mediocre art of trap artists. What this really is is a chance to post for the Gram & have a couple of good laughs. There is no deep dive into the trap culture or the music that was born from it.

5.0,2019-06-11T01:13:41.633Z,Calvana Cedant (Cal C),The trap museum was a very amazing experience of the history of trap music. The trap music museum was filled with all of our favorite artist and made just for the culture. The staff were very friendly and allowed us to experience the art and music that we call trap music. We were able to take alot of pictures of everything and sit on the infamous pink trap car. The front of the trap house even spelled like a trap house. It was dingy and smelled like old toes and I loved it. There was a recording studio that you could make a song. We really enjoyed the entire self paced tour.

Evidently, Google is not aware of any paths to this hotel that do not utilize the roundabout. That alone is enough to make me wish I booked elsewhere.

Then I arrived. The parking lot smells like a dead animal and the whole place smells like various kinds of smoke. Good luck finding an employee of you need one. And when you do find one, they'll probably give you helpful advice like cutting you off after the word 'Where' to tell you your room number is on your key packet. (Which, incidentally, was given to me separately from my key). Cool! Where's the elevator?

Everything--carpet and sheets, felt damp. We asked to move but were told all rooms were taken. Suspecting water damage, I found peeling wallpaper near the floor and doors in the hallway. Inspecting the room, ceiling paint was cracking, falling away, and stained with water rings. The walls are weak and give under pressure near the floor under the window.

Very drafty during the winter. Breakfast was trash. And there are bed bugs and bettles present in some areas and rooms this was the BIGGEST DISGUST AND TURN OFF. I do not have bugs of any type in my home and NEVER have much less in my bed so with that being said I will not sell myself short in someone else's establishment that's meant to make others feel comfortable.  I was un easy the remainder of my stay and had to do alot of mental conditioning to get past what i seen even after switching rooms... I'm a super visual person and once i see something its difficult to un see. I will not be back and wish like hell I could atleast get half of my money back for the major inconvenience. For this to not have been discovered tells me someone is not doing their job or fair share here. Thanks but no thanks Days Inn. When I visit it's for weeks to a month at a time so I take my booking seriously for the safety and comfort of my family above all else. This was unacceptable.

When my husband and I stayed, we found brown spots on the unwashed sheets and pillowcases, stained flooring, dirty walls, broken door and window locks, many patched holes in the wall, and a broken phone and picture frame.  We have stayed in hotels in third world countries that were cleaner and more kept up.  It took 45 minutes for them to switch us to a new room, where we discovered a crust spot on the bed cover.  Instead of an apology, the owner stated ""Well, I asked the housekeeper to check it for me.""  They brought a new bed cover after another 20 minutes.  We did not feel comfortable there not knowing if they even changed the sheets.  Instead of relaxing, we had to leave shortly after for our concert.  After we complained in the morning, the front desk lady asked us ""What kind of crust spot was it?"" in lieu of an apology.  I asked her how we were to know and why it mattered.  She then offered $10 off, which was not worthy of accepting.  The owner did not offer anything else and obviously does not take pride in her business.

I brought 8, and was told this special must be purchased in advance, and used between 5/1 & 6/1/19, no exceptions. The male employee ails started, he'd had a few customers the day before who wanted the discount as well, and he had to figure out how to get to the page that states it's online only! Having a large family, attending these establishments is difficult, not affordable, and discouraging when these discounts are misrepresenting the company without clicking farther into the website. Purchased the packs this time, but will not be doing this again in the future!

House made lemonade is sour-ly delicious

Fish tacos are perfectly fried and the sauce they have in the tacos really makes it taste better.

Salad is good, but the fried croutons with it is just yum!

Veggie burger is pretty thick, has flavor but isn't too dry.  The fries are like drugs.  Once you start you can't stop.

Dessert
Chocolate bunt cake is lovely.  Perfectly moist and sweet that it doesn't overpower the vanilla ice cream.  Sweet but not super sweet.  If that makes sense.
Pumpkin pie, is really simply done without added surger.  The pie crust is wonderfully done where you can't tell where it ends and the pumpkin moose begins.  The whipped cream on top is airy and goes great with the pumpkin flavor.",J.

The baked potato was delicious and very flavorful, but the strip steak with blue cheese crust was all panko breadcrumbs and very little blue cheese. The steak was also a bit tough for the $39 price tab.

Service was also very slow. 40 minute wait for a table that never came so I sat at the bar instead and then waited another 10 minutes to have my drink request taken.

The glass of red wine I chose was out of stock, so I had to choose something different and waited another 10 minutes for someone to ask if I wanted a drink. Surprisingly, the meal came out quickly, in about 15 minutes, but having to wait nearly 1.5 hours for an okay steak and a delicious baked potato was disappointing.

The restaurant was busy, but the two bartenders (and one additional bartender / waitress that kept floating in and out of the bar) with a devoted barback should be able to handle a dinner crowd.",J.

1.0,2018-10-02T12:36:21.928Z,Ash C,"1 star for a subpar/gross experience at Chicago Getaway Hostel. I rented a private room for 3 nights looking for a clean/decent place to sleep and shower while I was in the city for a work project. Chicago Getaway Hostel did not fit the bill.

The Hostel is in a beautiful Lincoln Park neighborhood with tons of giant trees and you really can't find a better location to get the LP vibe but then walk a block to hop on trains/buses. The cost for a private room is comparable to a hotel room, but I chose this place because it's location was within walking distance to where I was going to be working. After looking at reviews and photos of the hostel, it seemed like a very modern and clean place that I would be comfortable staying at... unfortunately the photos were deceiving and the reviews did not represent my experience.

When I walked up to the building, I had to walk through a crowd of people gathering on the sidewalk outside the hostel smoking (great for my asthma) to enter the building. This happened every time I entered/exited the building over the next few days, which was a real turn off to me. The check in process was quick - the person checking me in rushed through all of the instructions and gave me no written document that verified what he went over, so that was fun.

My room looked nice at first glance - 2 bunk beds, a desk, shower/toilet/sink. All the essentials. Upon further investigation here's what I found (some photos attached)... the bathroom was absolutely disgusting. I don't know when it was last cleaned, but it had to have been a long time. The amount of dirt/grime built up in that shower made me feel dirtier than I was when I walked in. One shouldn't have to buy flip flops to shower in a private room bathroom they rented. There was buildup ON THE SHOWER HEAD where the clean water is supposed to come out of but there was nastiness caked on so it passed through that first.

The beds were pretty uncomfortable. The mattress was very thin and I could feel the bars through it, so it was rough sleeping.

When we got in the room we noticed there was a cabinet for a refrigerator, but no refrigerator. I called the desk and was asked if I requested one. I told her no, that I didn't think I had to since EVERY hotel I've stayed in for the last 25 or more years had one in the room. I take prescription medication that must be refrigerated. I explained that to her. She said she would notify housekeeping. Several hours later I went to the desk and asked again, stressing my need for a refrigerator, again explaining my situation. We stayed for 2 nights and never got a refrigerator. I guess i should be grateful there was an ice bucket. Hopefully it didn't compromise the effectiveness of my prescription.
In addition, there was no microwave.
When we returned to our room the housekeeper was at the end of the hall.
There was a pile of dirty towels outside our room. We went out and when we returned hours later the housekeeper was gone but the pile of towels were still there. My husband called the desk to tell them they forgot to pick them up, they thanked him and assured him it will be taken care of. They were still there this morning when we left.

I was shocked because we expect so much more from a Marriott. I called and asked for the room to be cleaned while we were gone for a few hours, telling them that the floor was really dirty and the phone had so much dust on it it appeared it hadn't been cleaned in a very long time (just to give them some examples of the problems.) When we came back, it was clear someone had wiped down the phone briefly and swept the tile floor in the doorway, but the room was still filthy. I called again and let them know, and to their credit, they upgraded us to a much nicer much cleaner room. And I wasn't allergic to this room which was visibly less dusty and dirty.
We were thankful for the upgrade, but it should have never been necessary. I shouldn't walk into a room in a Marriott property to find it so dirty.

Checked in easily. But the key card stopped working when we left the room the first time and had to come back twice to get a replacement.
We weren't told to keep our phones away from the card until the third replacement.
We left for 3 hours and turned the AC down while gone.  Came back and the room was so hot we almost threw up packing up our stuff.
They then gave us a different room after we had to carry everything which took us 2 trips the first time down to the lobby back to the 5th floor. They did give us free breakfast for the inconvenience but would of been nice if they could of met us on the floor instead of 2 trips down to get the room and 1 trip with the luggage cart up.
Breakfast was so so half of the buffet was kinda cold. Wouldn't pay for it so for a free breakfast it's decent.
They also didn't explain any charges so I had a mini panic attacks that they charged me an extra 100 for my room only to go down and have the free explained

We celebrated my son's birthday poolside and had the best weekend! Room was adequate. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful especially with Covid concerns. Grab and go breakfast was a nice treat. We do staycations often and this is definitely our new go-to local hotel! Lots of great restaurants near by. Only request would be new lounge chairs around the pool as most of them had broken straps.,Marriott St. Louis West,,"Off Interstate 64, this laid-back hotel overlooking a lake is 4 miles from The Butterfly House and 7 miles from the National Museum of Transportation.

This facility far exceeded my expectations. The dressing rooms and facility itself was clean and updated. It was $35 for all three of us (out of city residents) to swim/play all day which isn't even one ticket at other water parks. We have been to our fair share of water parks, splash pads, etc. and I have never experienced lifeguards and staff remain so continuously attentive and alert in their positions. Not once did I see a lifeguard distracted by their cell phones, talking to each other, nothing of the sort. I noticed the staff rotated positions frequently, took safety checks in their zones, and were quick to act in situations to prevent accidents or injury.

My wife and I shared the deviled eggs and they were pretty good. We enjoyed a Moscow Mule and a Mojito. I had prime rib and it was cooked perfectly.  The taste was amazing with the au jus and horseradish sauce. I would prefer a baked potato over the mashed potatoes they served. My wife had the swordfish and she said it was fantastic. The atmosphere was quiet and relaxing.  Another great dining experience at J. Alexander's.,J.

4.0,2022-06-18T20:04:55.477Z,Kim Taylor,"I'm visiting here from Delaware, and I wasn't sure what to expect since the existing reviews are nowhere near consistent. I booked the hotel room through Agoda based solely on the fact that it was a very short (and safe) walk to Oven's Auditorium where my granddaughter's graduation from Hawthorne Academy was scheduled to take place. Overall, I am happy with the room. While it's far from the best place I've ever stayed, and the main elevator has been out of order the entire time I've been here, it has still been an enjoyable stay. The two photos that accompany my review are my photos taken with my Moto phone, not stock photos. My room was very clean upon my arrival. While the furniture was a little dated with a scuff here and there, everything was functional. A little Old English Scratch Cover would definitely make a huge difference in the existing furniture. That said, would I stay here again? Absolutely. The staff was very friendly. They offered me the use of their service elevator to go back and forth to my third floor room, which I thought was really nice since I'm almost 67 years old, and I don't particularly like flights of stairs. The only real disappointment was the fact that the hotel restaurant was permanently closed. Perhaps it was a victim of Covid. I'm not sure. There is a circa 1955 burger establishment almost directly across the highway, but you cannot walk there unless you want to take your life in your hands crossing the very busy highway. I wouldn't try it even if I were Usain Bolt in his prime. But I did drive there, and it only took me about 5 minutes using Google Go directions. (Their Ribeye sandwich was the best I've ever eaten.)  So yeah, I would definitely stay here again. It is ranked as a 3-star hotel, and I give it 4 stars myself because I felt very safe here, and they went out of their way to accommodate me. I will say that if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. Like any other hotel or motel on a busy highway, there is traffic noise at night.
