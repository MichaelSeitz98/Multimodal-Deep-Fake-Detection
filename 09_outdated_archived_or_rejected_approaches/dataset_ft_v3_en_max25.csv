"Hotel rooms are not great. They have not been updated since the early 1900s. The room my family and I stayed in had 2 bedrooms and a kitchen room that had the sink drains covered with a sign saying "" Do not use sink "". The bedrooms didn't have doors. The only bathroom was very small and was in the room with the two beds. The king bedroom used to have a bathroom but the door was locked with a table pushed up against it. In the entry room there was a big closet room where the king bathroom used to be,  which obviously was not useable. The entry door wouldn't lock. I had to stick a folded up card behind the door lock to make it latch properly. I was worried about a fire in the old building. I made sure I knew where the fire escapes were. One was out of a window in the main hallway that led to the fire escape stairway. Room left a lot of room for improvement.
The gambling hall was old but had some new remodeled bathrooms with gold bars and new tile.

Looks like a well maintained​ golf course. It has a nice clubhouse and OK RV park for peaple traveling. I'm not a golfer but I stayed at the RV park.  I saw how well they kept up the golf course.  I stayed in the RV park for two months.  They did not seem good at managing the RV park and at times the management didn't know who was even there.  At times they didn't even dump the trash cans. They sometimes went days without doing this and only dumped them oafter they started overflowing. The golf course was well kept but there was lots of weeds around the RV spaces.  Electrical is included but daily space rates seem high for what they have to offer. This was NOT a dog friendly RV park. They have very poor WiFi service.  They had no laundry facilities.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBbnNMd29BRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Riverside+Golf+Club+%26+Bistro+(Including+The+Rooftop+Bar)/@47.1206069,-125.4140854,8z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x5493e0255dc5e9d7:0xb2c62e38e1f6e65f!8m2!3d46.6744239!4d-122.9895987!16s%2Fg%2F1tdrx0cz?hl=en",ChIJ1-nFXSXgk1QRX-b24TguxrI,Golf course,3.0,Riverside Golf Club & Bistro (Including The Rooftop Bar),https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdCT2iU-tPfGVeA1Ym8Y5-9yfGdfZkPZZPjHNP=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

There are many other small and medium rides like crazy cars, and they also have some shows during weekend afternoons.

"I finally got a chance to check this place out. Most of the barcades are in Charlotte so it's nice to have one close to home. I went on a Thursday night which is ""guys night"" and was welcomed as soon as I walked in, both the owners and the guests were very friendly. For Thursdays, about all games were free (at least for dudes) except for pinball, which were .50 a game. Normally it's $5 a person for unlimited play and pinball is $1.00 a game (ouch to $1.00 pinball!). There were maybe 6 to 12 people rotating in and out while I was there, so not crowded at all. Parking was abundant. It's about a 5 minute walk from Freeman's. Bar can turn cash to quarters or can give you quarters from your bar tab for a 10% surcharge. Bar had food and drinks at fair prices. There are 2 gender neutral restrooms. There are a few TV's playing sports and comic book movies and YouTube videos. Place was open until midnight on a weeknight which was cool. There was one tv hooked up to a Nintendo 64 with a pretty large assortment of games. There were a couple party/board games sitting near a table. There was a fairly large area for outdoor seating as well. I think what made this visit special was how friendly the owners and guests were, felt like you were just visiting old friends instead of strangers.

EDIT: Citycade did a reconfiguration and brought in a racing game, a shooting game, a beer pong game and a couple of pay to win games disguised as games of skill. I believe at this point they've gotten rid of the $5 cover entirely and just made the machines take quarters, which I think was a good move. Pinball is still a buck which is a bummer since there are better options out there for $.50 a game, but it's close to home at least and the price point isn't uncommon. Pinball seems maintained and Citycade has occasionally swapped out for different pins, which is nice. Bathrooms are always clean which is a plus. Only complaint is that sometimes it can get a bit hot in the building.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdmFxUllnEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/CityCade+Classic+Arcade+and+Pinball+Game+Bar,+Gastonia+NC/@35.2341215,-81.0537741,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8856c1b3a8efdad9:0xd240e10ee1ba3f55!8m2!3d35.2632135!4d-81.1797882!16s%2Fg%2F11j7k_xln2?hl=en",ChIJ2drvqLPBVogRVT-64Q7hQNI,Bar,5.0,"CityCade Classic Arcade and Pinball Game Bar, Gastonia NC",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOYNN5y6gNITGaKA6YxbJtiodU2YD_0tsylVxD=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"Challenging course. Gorgeous sweeping views. 1) If you buy the Costco vouchers, call ahead. We were fortunate enough to talk with the Pro to validate ours, but he was very forward that we would not be able to play on a Saturday/holiday again.

"SUPERB AUTHENTIC THAI in the Pittsburgh area, a short 15 min drive from downtown.  Cozy restaurant with no-touch menu, short and sweet. It looks a popular spot to locals of many persuasions. Takeout or sit in (I have done both), it’s simply excellent food. A FOODIE’S GEM.

Start with Fresh Rolls and Fried Eggplant, contrasting but complementary textures and sweet tangy sauces that wake up the palate (very much unlike the cliche peanut sauce in the run of mill Thai-style places.

Any of the curry entrees are very good, smooth well-balanced sauces; none of that pungent sugar-loaded curry so common in so-called Thai restaurants in this town.

My recommendation: Duck Curry, very crispy well seasoned perfectly cooked duck atop the smooth Red curry with bell peppers and cherry tomatoes, carefully balanced with two halves of lychee just enough to brighten the palate: Simply Wow!

Pair the curry with any of the Thai stir fry veggies.  I’m partial to the Hot Basil fry, extra veggies (natural sweetness of the fresh vegetables complemented with their brown sauce).

By the way, enjoy Thai food with a spoon rather than fork/knife. Spoon the curry or veggies on rice, mix, then enjoy. Spoon allows one to taste every drop of the sauce.

Great service!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlODVHZThBRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thai+Tamarind/@40.4840871,-80.119055,13z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8834f4f8d66dcee3:0x9f38b06e37d3f35a!8m2!3d40.4912195!4d-80.047499!16s%2Fg%2F1tgk18xd?hl=en",ChIJ485t1vj0NIgRWvPTN26wOJ8,Thai restaurant,5.0,Thai Tamarind,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBCJ7xZJb2Oc-U2O_F0O66mrgbpsgAXzPo61Wm=w150-h150-k-no-p,restaurant

"I live directly up the street from this place on Washington Ave and I have got to say that I am absolutely disappointed with their quality of food.  Today, I just recently ordered their Pad Kee Mao and it looked like someone chewed up the meal and spit it right back out into the carry out tray.  The noodles were overly soggy and mushed up like mashed potatoes.  The salad that comes with the Lunch looks as if someone cut out a large chunk from a piece of lettuce, threw it into the tray, and then decided to splash a little sauce on top of it.

I don't normally complain about food and most times I simply ignore the mistakes but I've been living in Bellevue for 3 years now and this incident has happened more than once.  A customer can only be patient so many times and then there comes a point where a enough is enough.  This restaurant will never receive my services ever again.  I don't know if it's the cook or the management but the quality of food is poor.  Years ago the food was much better. I'm not sure what happened between then and now.

If you want a quality restaurant for Thai food, go to Niky's Thai Kitchen.  I promise you, Niky's Thai Kitchen is the better choice.  Their food quality is suburb compared to Thai Tamarind, especially for the price you'll pay for it.

"I've stayed at a lot of Marriotts because of business trips in the past 10 years. They usually don't fall below a certain standard, but it seems in this case they did.

The rooms were pricey and we had booked a room with 2 queen beds and they gave us a room with a king and a sofa bed. Now you might think of this as an upgrade if you had a couple booking the room, but this was for 3 people and getting a sofa bed when you have paid for a queen. When i mentioned this in the app, they said they would fix it the next day and they did, and they have us the room right next to ours which made for a very easy transfer through the connecting door, which is what raised my review from 1 star to 2.

I suspect they changed our booking because they were having a convention and needed the room but this isn't an acceptable reason.

Other things that bothered me were the cleanliness of the rooms. I attached a couple of photos showing what our floor was like in the first room and the dirt inside the coffee maker. In both rooms, the coffee makers were terrible with one even having hair in it.

Finally it saddens me to see a sad attempt to look progressive with 3 places to charge an electric car. 2 Tesla spots of which 1 was it of order and 1 for non Tesla electric cars.

If you want to add electric car charging to your hotel add 10 spots not have a token amount and not even functional

I think they rely on the event housing so much they don't really care about their amenities is status of their rooms so much. Because every night we were there they had all least 2 events going on.

For the price and the quality, might as well just stay in mystic close to everything.

It has baby Swiss, cheddar, tomato, red onion, and avocado on parmesan crusted bread. It was amazing. The onion was flavorful and the creamy avocado made the two melted cheeses even better. The parmesan added another layer of crispness to each bite. I upgraded to tater tots instead of chips, and I was surprised at the large portion. My daughter had a pancake and tots.

"Goods. Room was clean, working personnel nice, friendly and helpful from front desk to security and housekeeping, has a fym/fitness center, nice location, staying here pretty much gets you access to 3 casinos with a walking distance to Reno signature sign.
Bad stuff.
LINES ! If you there on the weekend when everyone else is there well let's say this place can't handle it's own capacity. To check in long line, to get to your room at certain  times there is a (no joking) 40 minutes wait line for elevator, now  it's not always but try to get back to your room when you really need something can be frustrating time in line for elevator.
Noise, I am talking hotel room, you can hear a lot from rooms nextdoor and hallway.
Bathroom!  Now that could be subjective but bathtub is very small, shower pipes makes loud noise while waiting for hot water and sink makes loud bubbly noises after use.
That's all major points. You can have great time staying there if you do it on not busy days, but if you have regular schedule and go there when most of people do, you might get frustrated standing in 40 minutes line for elevator when you just need to go to your room little quick.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMHZXUmFnEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Circus+Circus+Reno/@38.1399101,-128.4934264,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x809947369a6d96f1:0x8a35778e09b46c3e!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.5314464!4d-119.8157093!16zL20vMDVnNTAx?hl=en",ChIJ8ZZtmjZHmYARPmy0CY53NYo,Hotel,3.0,Circus Circus Reno,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOV3RPvxn-HupPql21Uni5wTZRo1bzyu0KYFMRk=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

There is something for everything I'm sure you would go and find something that you love since your childhood and you will definitely try to win that game.

They have a kiosk machine on which you can get a new card or load your old card. Machine accepts both card and cash which is really easy to use.

Stuff is friendly and helpful. Overall the place is really good for kids I would strongly recommend to keep this in your visit list whenever you go to Reno with your kids.

"I haven't been to Las  Vegas but if you have limited time and you are heading to San Francisco or  bay area and if casino is in your bucket list then you definitely need to add Reno to your list. We went on Saturday night and all the casinos were filled. We stayed in circus circus, it's one of the casino among the three giants which hosts its own casino. A perfect place to stay and enjoy in a casino.
Easy check-in and check out.Rooms were good, what else one might in need of. One drawback which I thought is number of boards were very less and casinos were all filled with digital ones which seems to be slightly bothering. All the bar and restaurant were good. Even if you want to take a walk , best time is to go after 10PM . You can have a good view of the lights .
The row is all integrated and you can move between all the 3 casinos . They too have play area like arcade games for little kids . Please note children are not allowed inside the casino .  You need to have alternate arrangements for that.

"Our experience here was awesome! My boyfriend and I did 'The Lost Ship' room. It was a Wednesday 7pm booking, so just the two of us took on the challenge without anyone else booking in. And we escaped with 90 seconds to spare!! Our guide, Captain Charles, did a fantastic job introducing the room to us with this whole back story to set us up. If you pay close attention, there are clues in everything he's saying as well.

The room itself was the best part. It was actually several rooms all joined together and from the lobby you had to figure out how to even enter the main room in the first place—super cool! I had never seen anything like that before. The puzzles were also really well thought out and interesting, using logic and problem solving (not at all abstract or random). Of all the escape rooms I have done, I would say that this has been the best experience I have had because of the attention to detail in the room, the quality of the puzzles, and the experience of being able to solve it with just the two of us.

The room is actually designed for at least 6 people, because it would have been helpful for others to take on and simultaneously solve riddles in the room. I'm pretty amazed we were able to do it with just 2 (but it was mostly because we had a few timely hints... big ones, lol). Awesome experience, highly recommend!!!

This has been one of the best sanctuary’s I’ve visited in Awhile. Our experience was amazing. We went on a cool Monday and most to all the animals we out for the public to see. All the big cats have Relatively large enclosures and all seem to be healthy.

"This is truly a hidden gem!

They have a dance group anyone can join; it's been very fun! Wednesdays at 7PM, except for the 2nd Wednesday each month.  I have literally no dance background, but this is folk dancing, so that's fine 😁

Edelweiss is located in German Park at the end of the drive.  The park itself isn't anything major, but the scenery is very nice.
Once at the parking lot, you can go in the main entrance and down the stairs to the restaurant or follow the sidewalk north of the building where it slopes down and around the building to their outdoor seating. You can see a gnome garden along the way!
I've seen comments saying this place isn't handicap accessible, but this sidewalk is the entrance to take if you have a wheelchair or stroller.  Understandably, this will be inconvenient if it is raining.
The outdoor seating is the beer garden area and the doors lead into the restaurant.

On Wednesdays there is a buffet.  I'm writing this review after a stop at their buffet and I'm impressed.
On Fridays they have live music; simply amazing fun!

They have several events through the year and I definitely recommend checking them out! Frühlingsfest, Jägerfest, Octoberfest and more!

Through the year, they have several German events, including an Octoberfest.  From what I hear, it's a blast!

Additionally, a local Duolingo group has started holding language events here and, separately, there is a lady who gives basic German lessons in the fall.

"I want to begin by saying I really love the atmosphere. The tables are spaced out enough that there is not much noise and it’s easy to talk to your table. The interior decoration is also very beautiful. There is not much parking but I live close so I walked. The food was delicious but there were just enough weird things that made me give 4 instead of 5 stars. The bread and butter (which is its own appetizer) is OK but definitely not anything to write home about, the butter pat was cold so not easily spreadable. I ordered the cauliflower main dish with sauce and golden raisins knowing it would be lighter than a meat main. However, with the price of the dish, I was expecting a bit more than 1/4 of a cauliflower head for my main meal. I know inflation and prices are high but cauliflower? Seems they could’ve spared a bit more. Additionally the olive oil cake with rhubarb and strawberry ice cream was good but the ice cream stole the show! The cake itself was just ok and the rhubarb had not been sweetened enough to make it palatable, I ended up taking it off. The service was good but not great, we had a new server and she made a few missteps that ultimately would have cost our party money if we hadn’t spoken up (as opposed to slow service, etc).

I mention all of this because the bar, from the moment you walk in the door, is set very very high. And the food is great. It's just not quite as beautiful as the decor or as perfect as the menu describes.
The tostones are plentiful and the brussel sprouts are crispy. But the sauces leave something to be desired.

Had previously called Bob to inquire about the course due to the mixed reviews.  Wildwood GC provides exceptional value and we put this course on our play again course whenever we're up here in the Portland area. Our foursome consisted of three Waialae Country Club and one Mid-Pacific Country Club members.  Mahalo Bob for taking great care of us.

Returned to play with some other buddies on May 6, 2017 before heading back to Honolulu the next day after a  five day golfing tour in the greater Portland area.  They were impressed Wildwood is on their ""will play again"" list.  Thanks Tom and the rest of the staff for taking care of us and welcoming us back.

"Just played here on Sunday 10/6, about three weeks post-punching. The greens are fantastic. They're rolling very smooth and true..and at a great speed. They're firm, yet they're holding shots the way they should. Also, the traps were all hand raked, and fairways were very playable.

Look for a new expanded green complex and new lower tee on the par three # 6, and new tee locations on # 7. One thing that always impresses me about Wildwood, is the attention to detail, and the constant reinvestment in the course and clubhouse.

Also, the service is always friendly and accommodating. If you've never played Wildwood, be sure to give it a try. It's a real hidden gem of a golf course, with plenty of interesting holes, lots of character and challenges, and spectacular views.

And finally, Wildwood is in such a peaceful, serene setting, that it has an amazing overall calming impact on my game, as you can see in the photo below, taken at the 15th tee.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdlpMcFlBEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wildwood+Golf+Course/@45.6802797,-124.0292931,9z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x54950078a06c4d17:0x288db95b2eead252?hl=en",ChIJF01soHgAlVQRUtLqLlu5jSg,Golf course,5.0,Wildwood Golf Course,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGy_CYiWqgD3Rvr0qeXgqUXEpgnj33gV2oGSsi=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"Their burrito game is STRONG!! Putting chain restaurants to shame since opening their doors, this local gem serves up deliciously grande portions of authentic Mexican grub. I ordered the chorizo burrito which doubled as lunch and dinner due to its gigante status. It came with a side of chips and a tasty jalapeño ranch dressing for dipping. It would have paired beautifully with a cerzeva or two, but I was there for carry out lunch so I laid off the booze until I could come in for a dinner here. Fast service.

"We have been staying at the Tropicana In Atlantic City for over 20 years.  This will be our last stay at the property.  From check in to check out we have never been treated so poorly. The resort is in bad shape. It isn’t ADA compliant as handrails are missing in the elevators and everything was dirty, as seen in the photos we posted.  At check in we were assigned a room that wasn’t clean.  There were potato chips all over the floor and the sheets were stained and gross with shoe prints all over the sheets.  We were assigned a new room, but it wasn’t much better.  There were boogers and blood wiped on the walls, the curtains had holes and the paint was peeling off the walls and headboards.  We had three guests and two towels.  When we requested more towels, housekeeping said we were only allowed two per room.  Two towels for three guests?  Housekeeping never came to our room to empty the trash or make the beds or collect old towels.  The next day we had to call housekeeping to get towels. I called back two hours later, and the gentlemen told me “Yeah, I have your slip right here” and then hung up on me.  The towels never came.  The only time housekeeping came to our room was to rush us to checkout.  By the third day the toilet stopped flushing properly and we had to use the casino restrooms. The hallway during our stay was disgusting and dirty.  The manager on duty couldn’t be reached.

I absolutely agree with other reviews that the road noise is significant and that site #14 is only appropriate for a smaller RV.

It seemed that several of the concrete pads were not level, we noticed an RV with both of its front tires off the ground after being leveled.

Food is a little spend but good, as expected for hotel restaurants. They were short staffed but the waitresses did their best and were very polite and accommodating. We decided to stay an extra night on a holiday weekend and while booked, the manager Joe pulled through for us and got us an extension. All of the staff work hard and are very polite.

"Ummm I probably wouldn’t come here because of the security, they were super strict, couldn’t do much but then again it’s their job, but they made us feel uncomfortable. We booked on Expedia which then brought me to Virbo and I had to create an account and the owners name is Tom. It was a little confusing but figured it out.
The apartment was very spacious and clean,to bedrooms and a set of bunk beds, it had everything you need such as laundry soap, condiments, utensils, plates etc. So we were able to grocery shop for the week.
When you go to the pool, the kiddie pool is not warm and there is an adult pool for night. The beach is beautiful but there is always a low tide so you will have to walk a little to get to the water.
The town is not fully developed, so don’t expect a Cancun experience but you will find authentic Mexican food when you drive into the town.

"This is arguably the best sushi in Easton (maybe even the shore)! I've tried all the others and I keep coming back. The staff is friendly and always asks about my family when I come in alone. The wait for food is never long, even if the place is full. You can dine in at lunch and get back to work quick. The menu items consistently taste amazing and are prepared the same way everytime... there are no surprises, if you order an Olympic roll it's going to be amazing Every Single Time, and that surely can not be said for the other places in town. Some of my favorites are ""Amazing Tuna"" ""Jingle Bell"" ""Olympic"" ""Incredible"" and ""spicey crab"" but all of them are good. If you go between 12 and 4 the special is ""get 1 special roll and get a second at half off"". Oh, and their unsweetened tea is the best in town, I know that's a small thing but it matters to me since I've given up soda.

Save your money, and use the $25 for something that is more than 10 mins long. Also for $75 we could have   had hours worth of fun some where else in the city rather than 10 mins.

"At best, I'm a novice at the aquarium hobby. I've been setting up an aquarium and navigating all the intricacies that comes with setting up a new aquarium. In doing so, a social media aquarium hobby group recommended the Austin Aqua Dome as a solid, local hub for hobbyists. During my visit, I was greeted and invited to ask any questions I might have.

The building calls back to the ""Keep Austin Weird"" idea in both supporting a local business *and* being a wonderfully unique shopping experience in offering an infinite collection of aquarium related materiel to purchase- from fresh water to salt/marine, from ponds, to desktop bowls and extravagant custom aquariums. My overall experience was akin to me being a kid going on a great field trip like a previous visitor mentioned in their review.

Though I am still waiting to introduce fish to my aquarium, I was able to have questions answered about different live plants suitable to my experience and want for the type of fish community I'll eventually be keeping. I was introduced to a myriad of different plant varieties and they had a wonderfully diverse set of options to choose from. I ended up purchasing 5 plants of two different kinds and a wonderful piece of prepared driftwood for my setup. I also bought a plant solution to introduce and maintain for my water that promotes growth. Finally, because I look to continue my business relationship with Austin Aqua Dome, I purchased a one year membership that will likely pay for itself as my odyssey into this passtime grows. High fives all around and I can't wait to go back again and, if my S.O. doesn't kill me, maybe start a 2nd aquarium in the near future!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNnZEbU5nEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Austin+Aqua-Dome/@30.229189,-97.7858588,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x8644b4caed938353:0xd15c7b293e7a71b1?hl=en",ChIJU4OT7cq0RIYRsXF6Pil7XNE,Tropical fish store,5.0,Austin Aqua-Dome,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzvTCZ1dR9jzbJqUaP3jWK9k5QhwuCKQhrCG9j=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"Very nice selection with a few issues: Many of the tanks are mislabeled; the fish are a different species or don't have a label at all. The short woman with the bangs is very rushed and careless when handling fish. She seems to be annoyed with questions and customers overall. All of the other employees, however, are friendly and care about where/how your fish will be living.

Aisles are a bit narrow, and I doubt they're ADA compliant. Salt water tanks are on the second floor, which is only accessible via stairs. Pond area is nice. The parking can be tricky, but it's mostly shaded.

"Excellent service, friendly staff, huge wine list and tasty food. We had a great bottle of Chianti. Then we split the calamari and caprese. The calamari was perfectly cooked, not chewy at all. I saw the guy in the kitchen breading it. The caprese was honestly one of the best I've had. Being winter, the tomato wasn't the best but the mozzarella was perfect. It was topped with a delicious pesto. And the plate was drizzled with the thickest balsamic glaze I've ever had. It was almost like caramel. The balsamic glaze was extremely flavorful. For our main courses, we had the Tuscan Nido and the wild mushroom Tagliatelle. The Tuscan Nido was basically a giant ravioli. The filling had great flavor. I loved the pops of whole peppercorn and the fried sage leaves. The pasta was clearly homemade and perfect. The wild mushroom Tagliatelle was even better. The mushroom flavor was amazing and the smell was just divine. Normally, I would have liked to see the addition of truffle to a dish like this but honestly, I think it was near perfect without. The mushrooms just had such good flavor. To top off our meal, the lady who seated us came around to see how our meal was. Based on our conversation, I assume she was the owner.

It was later on a Saturday night and after we had placed our orders we were pleasantly surprised when our server not only brought some bread, but a nice bruschetta appetizer, as well, and he explained it was on the house since they were low on bread.  I went with the lasagna, as I also do, on my first visit to an Italian restaurant and it did not disappoint.  We had also ordered a beef carpaccio appetizer for the table that was quite excellent.

"Today my family and I arrived at Golden Corral in Sterling Heights Michigan and were extremely disgusted with what we saw.

After paying (over $60) we finally found a table that was clean. When we went to the bar, we saw nothing but food thrown all over the floor, the bar was disgustingly dirty, and completely empty. Servers and the manager were just walking through the food all over the floor, never cleaning anything at all. It was so bad, I decided to take photos as well for you.

After sitting down, it took us 15 minutes to get silverware, and over 25 min to get drinks. Our server never cleared the plates from our table when needed either.

As for at the bar; the woman doing the steaks was more interested in flirting and trying to get a date with a customer than actually helping customers, cleaning anything, or even putting steaks on the grill. The salad bar was basically full of rotting fruit and slimy lettuce.

At the desert bar, there was chicken on the floor, food everywhere. My biggest concern was the fact that there were peanuts all over the bar, mixed into other toppings, on the cookies, on the brownies, etc. As someone with an extreme nut allergy, this type of cross contamination is deadly, let alone disgusting.

For $60 my family and I ate one plate of food that was cold by the time we got our silverware because the bar was empty and never refilled. I understand that places may be short staffed but that is not an excuse for any of this. If the health department would have walked in, the place would have been closed immediately….and honestly should have. When the manager, the staff, the servers, and guests are having to walk through food on the floor and nothing is being cleaned or refilled, that’s awful. We have been here several times and this is the most disgusting restaurant I have ever seen.

We used to love coming to this place especially on a friday! Now a days days the food quality has dropped tremendously. The options of which they serve you is bare minimal or cold. Went to get meat on friday there is no special meats any longer. The ham and ribs were cold. Steak used be a better quality as well. Salad bar doesn't include bacon anymore? No mk or chocolate fountain. Only 2 pie selections. As I said the quality used to be better. All of these are things noticed by my child it's her favorite restaurant. My waitress was awesome ty Brittany. Over all the food was def not fresh all but the steak the options were slim and not very tasty. I tried a little of everything even the bourbon street chicken used to be better. I understand that sometimes business is slow but this was dinner rush 6 pm to 7pm .  Prolly won't bring my child back.

This restaurant has to be the worst of the worst. The appearance and taste of the food has declined over the years but yesterday was the bottom. Breakfast foods were burnt the pancakes and hashbrows. The lunch items seemed to be better but onenof my guest became ill  upon eating the soup that they warm in the tray tables during breakfast.  Food was visibly dry and looked as if it was from yesterday.  The manager Mitch was rude and made bad claims upon my family when one person requested a refund upon eating the soup or salad that they became sick with.

"MOLD AND TERRIBLE HOUSEKEEPING!!! Front desk has great customer service. Kayla was very attentive and has great customer service. I stayed ten nights and housekeeping would show up every other day. I had to do my own bed, and take out my trash on the days that no one would show up. On the days that they showed up it was around 4 PM and in a bad mood. I talked to a manager by the name of Kyle three times and he did nothing about it. My shower was never cleaned even though I mentioned to the housekeeping lady that I had mold in the shower.

"You will miss your bed at home real quick! The only thing keeping me from giving a two star or worse rating was the fantastic customer service: front desk, housekeeping, and the breakfast attendant. Otherwise this Hilton-brand Hampton Inn and Suites is not worth the higher price point than many of the other options in Aberdeen and is way overdue for a refresh (maybe we can blame Covid-19). The colors and finishes in the lobby, halls and rooms are dinged, scuffed and just plain ugly. The king-sized bed in our non-suite room was caving in and needing replacement. When booking, be aware not all the rooms are like the pictures on the site, some are very plain with no kitchenette, just an awkward mini fridge and microwave by the desk in the room. No real dresser if you like to unpack just a small hutch with sticking drawers that the TV sits on. Pull out style love seat sofa seemed like a great option for the kids, but the window was very drafty and our son about froze the first night. The blankets were very thin waffle weave style. We asked for a second for the next night and he put on extra clothes and was okay. Not comfortable enough for an adult, he slept on it backwards, because even he could feel the metal. The bathroom was a good size which was nice for a family traveling with younger kids, but the bathroom fixtures were loose and the shower almost didn't work. The toilet took several flushes. The pillows in our room weren't the usual mixture of firm and soft (feather and polyfill as it turned out for here), but housekeeping brought us new ones when we inquired at the front desk during breakfast. The breakfast was quite good. Many choices, including an oatmeal area with fixings, plus other hot options, waffles, fresh fruit, yogurt, biscuits and gravy one morning and the next eggs and sausage patties. Coffee options were hot. Pool and hot tub area was small, but we had fun anyways. Pool towels were restocked regularly. Elevator floor became sticky one evening, but as we were in and out, right away they had it mopped I noticed. Again, great customer service that way. We also did laundry which was weirdly on the second floor off in the corner, kinda creepy, but washing and each dry cycle was just a dollar in quarters.

He check us in and off we went to our room Tilla. Tilla was the 1st room up the stairs on your left. Room was rather small but well designed and very cozy. The antique looks gave it a very stylish english look. The washroom was large enough and had a sky light to it. B&B main building was well decorated (pics attached) and well kept. This beautiful B&B was one of the best we have visited so far. Their breakfast was really good with some freshly baked chocolate Croissant, Cherry Yogurt, Juices Cereals and much more.

"Unfortunately I don’t have anything good to say about Gaia house . When we were sat down there was paint bubbling near us, probably due to moisture trapped behind the paint. And then a leak above. It’s not really an appetizing sight.

We were told that we wouldn’t be able to have espresso or lattes because the espresso machine was down. That’s fine. What I did take issue with was the self serve coffee station. For one, the way the glasses were stored was gross. The shelves were not clean. The cups were freshly washed. I could tell because they were wet, placed rim down. So that the dust and debris on the shelving was collected on the wet rims of the cups. And whenever you picked up a cup you could see the wet rim marked it left. These cups should be dry if you’re going to store them rim down. Drying them rim down traps the moisture inside (causing an unpleasant odor and taste), and damages the shelves, and is altogether unsanitary if the shelves aren’t even clean. Storing them rim side up would be a better option in this case . They are used often enough for collecting dust to be an argument for storing them rim side down. Sanitary conditions aside, for a vegan/vegetarian place for the only milk option to be whole milk was disappointing. Consider offering milk alternatives.

The food was even more disappointing . My guest ate his omelet , but I good not stomach my food. The cornbread French toast was incredibly dry, even soaking it in the butter and syrup didn’t revive it. The potatoes tasted fine but they were stale. Since it was the only semi edible thing available to me I picked at that instead of what I ordered. I only managed to eat half of one slice of French toast and didn’t want to take it home. We came out of our way to go here after seeing it on Instagram.

"I loved this re-discovery recently! I vowed that if I ever noticed that Gaia Cafe was back  in any way I would maintain patronage as I used to frequent the Cafe when I was a student at Aquinas with friends and family as I maintained a vegetarian diet the majority of my time in attendance there. Thank you for coming back, I love the changes and the maintenance of staple favorites like B.Y.O.B. and Mean Green Burrito. I personally chose the Veggie Stash as recommended by my wonderful hostess (I selected the vegan options for cream cheese and cheese toppings as in recent years I have had to cut dairy out of my diet more fully). I had a lovely experience with the self service water and coffee, enjoying the flow of the community coming in and out of the Cafe as I spent a few hours there working on a few personal and professional goals and trying a new, but also nostalgic, meal.

Unpretentious, casual, warm interior. Small menu, but nice to have so many vegetarian and vegan options. Good to have the opportunity to try something different, outside the normal brunch fare.

I stuck with what I normally like - eggs & potatoes plus tried a fruit cup. It was a filling portion and cooked well. The potatoes were well seasoned and crispy. I also enjoyed the sourdough bread that came with my meal. The fruit was fresh and seasonal. Coffee was self-service and offered three options, with creamer available at request. I tried the Swiss chocolate brew and liked it a lot. My friend’s specialty French toasted looked amazing. It has tender sweet sautéed apples, cherry sauce, and almonds.

"We were driving from Portland home to Canada and it was getting quite late so we found the little town of Shelton and it seemed like a convenient place to stop, being only an hour and a half from the Port Angeles Ferry. We googled a place to stay in Shelton and there was a very limited selection so we pulled into a couple and looked for reviews. Let’s just say they sounded like rat motels from what we read from other travellers. Once we saw there was a Super 8 in Shelton it seemed like the natural place to say as they are typically a decent place to stay being a franchise and all.

We checked in around 8pm and the front desk person was friendly although seemingly bored with his job. The lobby was clean and nice. We had a truck full of purchases that we didn’t want to leave outside overnight so it was nice that there was an emergency door close to where we parked for bringing all our stuff in. The front desk person did state that the hotel was located in a decent part of town and our stuff would probably be fine.

We paid $70 for the night which was high considering it was a fairly old hotel. It appeared to have been renovated at one point but the work was amateur at best. There were simple things like repairs to the towel bar which were just never painted over. Little touches like that go unnoticed when done but become BIG eyesores when left not finished. The temperature in the room was hard to keep consistent. I had to keep turning on and off the heat because the room likely is not well insulated. The bath towels were small and the caulking around the tub was gross. There was a mini fridge and coffee area, which was a nice touch.

We didn’t use any of the amenities, we literally just used this hotel to sleep as a crash pad and it did its job. We felt it was pretty clean and mostly quiet and if we had to stay in Shelton again this would definitely be our first stop.

"Everything from start to finish was fantastic! The onion soup was flavorful and did not need the Gruyère cheese, but the cheese made it better. Perfect for a cold winter night! The steak tartare was also flavored well with peppers and the perfect ratio to the sauce. The chips made it even better. The duck breast matched well with the parsnip purée and was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The flavor profile had a gamier edge. The portion sizes were generous, and there were extra duck pieces mixed in with the vegetables. The cocktails were a delight: my old fashioned had a clear, custom cut ice cube that added to the aesthetic charm. The drink tasted better over time as the ice melted.

"We had a wonderful experience at Westchester for lunch! The decor is beautiful and the “vibe” inside is welcoming and cozy but also hip. I ordered the grilled chicken mezze salad and it was beautiful, but also delicious. The duck fat truffle fries were also phenomenal. We brought our kids (7 and 4) so Chef Matt made them a grilled cheese (he also added delicious crispy fries) and amazing buttered noodles. He even sent our server, Olivia, out to double check that multi grain bread was ok for the grilled cheese. Olivia was a wonderful server as well and knew everything about the menu, and the owner was there at the host stand greeting people as they came in. There was a big table of women having a fun lunch and the bar was full of groups of men hanging out as well. I am born and raised in Chesterfield and it’s totally unique and awesome for the area.

"So I love Hyatts and are even Hyatt members (but am not necessarily brand loyalist) and thought how can we go wrong with staying here especially with the location. Well other than the location, I have to say for a Hyatt we were disappointed. To begin with we upgraded our room to get a water view with a bacolony. Being a member and having the app it allows you to upgrade the day or two before your reservation. Well, our room was ready early but it wasn't the right room we paid extra for. 😒 it was a water view from the side of the building (oh I see what they did there that's sneaky) but where is my damn balcony. To make matters worse every time I went down to deal with it at the front desk there was a huge line and only 1-2 people working the front desk ... Which seems a little short staffed considering its such a huge hotel on the weekends. I would always just give up and resolve to come back later. A couple times I tried calling on the phone and no one would even answer the phone just pick up the phone and hang it up. 😡. The major problem we had was the Valet service. SLOW, SLOW, SLOW. Again, because they are often parking your cars off site (we were told this by the actual staff) they DON'T have ENOUGH PEOPLE WORKING. I had read the reviews and peioke griping about the valet so I told me husband hey call about 20-30 min before we need our car. We would get the phone call to our room ""please proceed down to valet your car will be ready in 5 min"" and THEN STILL WAIT ANOTHER 15-20 MIN. This is ABSOLUTELY unacceptable especially when they are charging you $30/night and MANY other hotels in the city that are just as expensive are free or not nearly the cost. I dont mind paying, don't get me wrong I actually love the convenience of valet.... But DAMN you better get that service locked down because it is making your hotel look like ammature hour!

"Absolutely wonderful hotel.

We stayed here for a drive from FL to Atlanta, and wanted a change of scenery instead of going up I75 again.

It's in an perfect location, on site valet parking is a bit pricey, but the Whitaker Street garage is a very short walk to the hotel and much cheaper to park at.

Walking along the river is quite nice too. Watching the ships is quite cool.

The sun deck on the 7th floor give a nice view of downtown Savannah, and the Garden Terrace on the 4th floor has a great view of the river with comfortable and quiet seating.

When we arrived we saw many signs for the Georgia Association of Realtors, so we were a little worried it'd be noisy, but it is dead silent in the room.

This is by far the quietest hotel room I've ever been in. In the hallway is quite a bit noisier, but in your room it's literally silent.

Even with someone above you, you can't hear them take a shower unless you are in the bathroom deliberately trying to hear it. It's fantasticly quiet.

The bathroom is fairly small, I will agree with those reviews, but it's not unreasonable at all.

In my opinion the only thing that gives away how old this hotel is are the elevators. They look so incredibly dated it's hilarious. The boxy glass elevators are in desperate need of modernization. One of the 3 are out of service for updates, but who knows when that will be done. There's enough reviews on here saying it's been in progress for a while. Only having two elevators was not a hindrance at all though.

The bar was pretty nice too, and the outdoor seating area has a great view of the river. I'd totally recommend the River Street Rendezvous cocktail. It's excellent if you like rum and pineapple juice.

Overall, I'd definitely stay here again. Hyatt continues to deliver on their legendary quality.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpd2ZyUnhnRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hyatt+Regency+Savannah/@32.9613127,-91.8300175,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88fb9e6410b40f99:0x27d1b05532b0a2e7!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d32.0815354!4d-81.0914177!16s%2Fg%2F1vzg32h5?hl=en",ChIJmQ-0EGSe-4gR56KwMlWw0Sc,Hotel,5.0,Hyatt Regency Savannah,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjROC5xbZiq9hMhp0f6hccOz8cU6deKB503kcT=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"What can I say - if you want a great view of the river, this hotel offers it. The staff was super friendly and gave the best suggestion for local eats. The hotel is an upper class style hotel which we don't usually stay at, so there were some nice perks we weren't accustomed to. Someone took our bags from the vehicle, to check in and up to the rooms (tips are customary). All vehicles are Vale parked (which incurs a cost). There is no late check-out option (something my family usually looks for... Mainly because I tend to enjoy sleeping in!). Regardless, it was a very elegant and comfortable hotel. My favorite part? The elevator requires your hotel key after 10 - nice feeling of an extra layer of security.

"Pros:
Service staff other than the front desk was amazing
Food was awesome
Beds were comfortable
Gym setup was spot on

Cons:
Too musky and humid feeling inside the whole building
Vending machines malfunctioning
Front staff was very short with people
Too pricey for accommodations
Pool wasn't worth it
No microwaves in rooms
Elevators were sketchy and not working with ZERO ventilation

I think the bell staff was AMAZING and gave great suggestions for hot spots and restaurants. I felt they went above and beyond.  Along with the restaurant staff they had during the breakfast.  The gym facility was also a plus as you don't find many hotels that dedicate that much money to health amenities. Not to mention the cooling towels,  that was a nice touch! Beds were very comfortable too and clean.

As far as the stay goes I believe it was lacking significantly especially for over $200 a night for a room with no view and for what was advertised online.  The air quality in the building all together was humid and sticky feeling the whole stay.  The elevator air was MISERABLE! The bathrooms in the rooms have no ventilation to move air when showering.

Numerous elevators were broken and unusable on a consistant basis to where I felt the need to take the stairs as a safety precaution not to mention with the fire alarms going off (I understand they might not have the ability to control fire alarms).  The mini fridges could only hold a few items and there was no microwave except for one we found 2 floors below us.  The vending machines also seemed to be malfunctioning as we had family choose water and it gave them a soda.

The breakfast served was AMAZING! The peach pound cake was out of this world!  Again the staff's hospitality... they were 100% Johnny on the spot. But with such pricey rooms I don't understand why there isn't a complimentary breakfast or to charge a lower amount.

The pool downstairs was also another area that was overly elaborated on the website and in person, was a complete let down...it was murky looking with high chlorination and not much to work with when more people got in (10 people was pushing space).

Upon our departure we called the front desk to have a cart brought up to take out our luggage,  we were told it would just be a minute and they would take care of it (this was really the only staff I don't feel weren't so welcoming). After 30 minutes of waiting we looked out into the lobby to see if it was busy because it was around check in time and there were NO lines.  My mother went downstairs and spoke to a bellboy about getting a cart and he had no idea someone was waiting for one to be brought up.  Again bellboy hospitality was spot on! He even clarified the quickest directions to get us home.

I also want to mention the cleaning staff... although we did not encounter them taking care of our room, everytime I passed someone in the hallway they were smiling and saying hello. This was our first time to Savannah and while being leery in new places I must say we felt like we were welcomed there as though we were family stopping in for a visit.  I just wish the hotel amenities were more up to the standards they present online. This was our first time staying in a Hyatt hotel as Hilton has been my #1 go to for years and venturing out has shown why I have been loyal to their hotel...

It's unlikely that I would stay here again, but if I did it would only be due to how awesome their service staff treated us😊!!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBLTRiYlBBEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hyatt+Regency+Savannah/@32.9613127,-91.8300175,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88fb9e6410b40f99:0x27d1b05532b0a2e7!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d32.0815354!4d-81.0914177!16s%2Fg%2F1vzg32h5?hl=en",ChIJmQ-0EGSe-4gR56KwMlWw0Sc,Hotel,3.0,Hyatt Regency Savannah,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGiVyLwwg3SH4l89mB2-Xc5IJCO5GPjNjo05Ah=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"The appearance of this hotel is great but I hope you don’t have to call the front desk. You have to call for any towels, to have your room clean, etc….. the wait times to call are greater than 5 minutes. The room with the lights and suites above was very good for the conference, thermostat just right, screens beside the stage large but speakers hang in front of them. Conference food was absolutely lacking any taste or creativity. Vegetarian option was pasta with a can of warmed tomato sauce dumped on top.
Hotel staff was very nice. The bathrooms were staffed with people for the conference area and were kept exceptionally clean… I mean SPOTLESS! Overall, it’s an OK hotel but needed more staff. We were there for 6 days and wasn’t able to get a cart for the luggage when we arrived or left.
The location of the hotel seems good considering the proximity to BWI airport. You have to walk through the Casino to get to more food and the choices are slim. Vegetarian options were a negative. Some of the casino staff wouldn’t let you bring outside food back through the casino. You go up 3 floors, through the garage, and back down on the other side.

"La Creme is a chic creperie located on Main St in Zeeland. The space is bright and airy which makes for the absolute cutest place to have brunch!!

The wonderful thing about La Creme is that they have both sweet AND savory crepes!! If you wouldn’t call yourself a sweet tooth, then you are in luck because their menu includes some crazy amazing savory crepe options!

Their savory crepes are also naturally gluten-free: BONUS!

And it is SO FUN to watch them make the crepes as they add in all of the yum that it’s filled with and then fold it into a delicious MASTERPIECE 💫

Because I meannnn do you SEE how beautiful those are?! 🤩

While their main focus is crepes, La Creme also offers everything from yogurt bowls to smoothies to coffee to boba to macaroons to pastries and EVEN MORE!!

"After passing this restaurant numerous times my hubby and I   decided it was finally time to give it a try.  Well...we were not disappointed! We began our meal with the fried mozzarella which was highly recommended by both the hostess and our server.  Excellent and not your typical...these were huge and there were five of them..more like logs as they're referred to by staff! And marinara dipping sauce was really good...just a slight kick to it.  Hubby then had  a crabcake and shrimp and chicken fajitas (he couldn't decide between the two as entrées so getting the crabcake as an add on worked out great!)...and I had the yummy strawberry apple walnut salad with chicken. The entire meal...and a few adult beverages...were perfect! And our server, Sammie (sp?) was so helpful, friendly and sweet... made our dining experience even more enjoyable.

"My wife and I stopped here for lunch following a trip to Chriskindlemart.

We were quickly greeted by the hostess and or waitress Kim came over to us to take our order relatively quickly. She greeted us with a smile in a very friendly manner.

We both ordered the strawberry lemonade which is a great thirst quencher. For appetizers,  we shared the crab dip and brown butter buffalo wings which were delicious.

For meals, my wife had the crab cakes with brussel sprouts and the bacon twice baked potato. She said the crab cakes were very good but said the brussel sprouts,  although extremely tasty and flavorful,  were not fully cooked and were somewhat hard. She also said the twice baked potato filling was very good, but the skin of the potato was very hard and overcooked.

I had the butter garlic strip steak medium well with the broccoli, potato wedges and the stuffed potato.

The steak was served already sliced, and although not a huge problem, not something that I prefer. It was slightly over cooked. To me, medium well it's slightly pink in the center (serving temp around 160*) but it was cooked well done. Also, the menu says roasted garlic and herb butter. I didn't sense any butter on it and it came with quartered garlic on top. The wedges were very tasty and seasoned nicely as was the stuffed potato.

For dessert we had the funnel cake fried Oreo's which was delicious!

The presentation of all the food was exceptional. The cleanliness of the restaurant was superb. There wasn't a time when we didn't see someone cleaning.

Lastly, the food was not very expensive for the portions.

"After a few years of renting boats from a local competitor that always had issues (non existent bimini, broken gas gauge, engine that was leaking gas, dirty and old boats, etc), i decided to try a new rental place.

I rented the 18 foot 150hp Bowrider.  There were no massive issues like before.  The boat was clean, fast, and fun.  The stereo didn't work but we had a wireless water proof speaker for this anyways.  We rented for 3 days and came back once for a fuel up in between.

The only downside was that we hit an underwater log in the middle of the lake.  They showed me the damage to the skeg and as I had taken a pic of the prop/skeg before the rental, it was undeniable.  Got hit with a $350 charge for repair, but I can't blame Yankee as this is part of the risk of boating.

The staff were busy each day with a tractor, snow blower and shovel keeping it as clear as possible. Obviously it was impossible to take advantage of much of the amenities like the pool, playground etc. The gift shop was nice and had some items we purchased. Ate one meal from the bar/cafe as take out due to covid restrictions and outside seating was a bit cold, although they did have several heaters out. The cabin, 5B was clean, warm and romantic.

The rooms are clean and quiet and the breakfast this morning was fast and the omelet chef made a creation that Wolfgang Puck would be proud to share.   If you want a great place to enjoy the beach with wonderful people to take care of you book now.

Update.

The last night we decided to dine at Voyager's.  Eddie got us the perfect window table and the cuisine is the best on the coast from Pensacola to Orange beach you won't find a better view or better service or better steaks.  Save room for dessert.  I do recommend reservations.

I WOULD NOT recommend this place for a conference just based on trying to reserve a room and set up for conferences.

The front desk folks are nice and polite.

I COULD NOT stay at the hotel because they would answer the phone and transferred me to a number that would just disconnect you and emails go unanswered or vague responses with no answers to your questions.

They seem to be focused on valet services and conference fees but making vendors at conferences jump through hoops. You must leave keys with the valet to unload and you can't use the side doors because it bypasses the valet.

"Very economical. This sampler I got had 4 different things on it using a big plate. For $3 more, you get a salad and drink. All said and done, about $12 for everything, and it was a ton of food. Service was great. Food was prepared quickly, very friendly people, and attentive to check up on you. Bread sticks (when dining in) are unlimited, and they come hot and fresh, buttered and seasoned with garlic. They are super soft and fluffy. Honestly, I rate their breadsticks above Olive Gardens. They are wonderful. Reasons why I’m not going with 5 stars, is nothing that this location has control over. It’s not a complaint of the individual location itself. First issue is, I felt the Alfredo sauce was very bland. I’ve had stuff out of a jar at home that beats it. Secondly, the amount of sauce (all 3 pastas had the same issue) they put on is very little compared to the noodles you get. My feeling is, I can buy a pound of uncooked noodles for $1 at the store. After they absorb the water, you’ve got 2lbs of noodles for $1. Commercially, they buy them much cheaper than that even. Noodles are incredibly cheap. Yet, you’re not really given enough sauce for them. Since pasta is so cheap, you’d think they could afford another 50 cents of sauce. The picture makes it look ok because it’s all on the top. It certainly looks like a decent amount of sauce. But you can’t see the noodle to sauce ratio. Also, I assume they have a pre-specified ladle size they are told to use. However, mix things up (or eat the top portion), and you’ll quickly find yourself eating plain noodles. Again, I’m sure this is a corporate thing, and not location specific, but you’re reading my review because you want an honest review, right? So, I’m going to tell my experience as it was. Over all, I’m giving it 4 stars still, as service is good, breadsticks are wonderful, and food was pretty good, aside from the lack of sauce. Go in there prepared with this info, and see what you think. And remember, those wonderful breadsticks... they are unlimited. They will keep bringing more if you want.

"I've eaten there, and now I work there. So I get to see the food ""behind the scenes"". Most, if not all, is homemade in the sense that whoever the cook is, they will cook it their own way with their own ingredients like they would in their own home. So you get to try the same food about 4 to 5 different ways which I think is pretty awesome. The cooks take allergy warnings very seriously. The owners come in pretty much every day to make sure we dont stray off of the path that they made to build this restaurant and its food upon. We have SO many return customers that when they're off work they will hang out with us from open to close. We strive to be extra friendly and helpful! And our MANY return customers can verify.  We have 2 flat screens to watch your sports on or for your child to watch cartoons so you can eat with some peace (lol). Our food is great tasting. Certain waitresses will buy 4 to 5 bowls of homemade cream of crab soup to take home for the night. As an example. So if we trust the food enough to eat it AND buy it in bulk, I'm sure you will love your dinner! Since I started working 1 month ago, I have yet to hear not even one complaint. If I work somewhere that's not all that good, I'm not afraid to say so. So I promise I'm not on here because anyone told me to, or to try to gain more customers etc. I simply rated it because my phone noticed how often I come here and asked me to review it LOL. Dont be afraid to give it a try. The portions range from ""good size for the money"" to ""Massive""! We are located inside the Laurel De Truck Stop/gas station with the Hardees hooked to it.

"Five stars for Funcity!

Such fun when our Swedish relatives gathered  at Funcity  for our annual December  celebration. This year we jumped for joy at Funcity trampoline park in New Britain, CT.

In a party room we shared a meal 🍱 , enjoyed a Swedish 🇸🇪 show & tell, and ended with a children’s book 📕 exchange.

In the trampoline playground, both young & old LOVED 🥰 the toddler trampolines, bubble court, foam pit, zip line, dodge ball court, foam Legos, slides, rope course, climb wall, massage chairs, video games, trampolines, etc.

Staff members were helpful, friendly, & knowledgeable.

I'm only going to give the burgers a 2 out of 5.  The bun was double the size of the burger. The burger was dry, and the bottom of the burger was hard as if it was precooked and sitting. They didn't even ask or include any veggies for the burger.  No lettuce. No tomatoes.  No onions, and I paid 13 bux for this burger.

There’s a park across from here so you park there and walk. Perfect for people with little ones. The woman at the window could of been more friendly! The cost per adult is $9.00 and $7.50 for active military with ID. It’s a short zoo but very nice. The animals did look sad! My son got to feed the goats. Please fill up the food machine! It takes only quarters. The weather was beautiful! I was hoping we get to feed the giraffes.

"Beautiful little zoo, fun for the whole family!  We stopped by here it was a pleasant surprise! The price is very inexpensive $7 for adults, $5 for kids . They had a large variety of animals ;animals looked well taken care of and feed. Lots of sanitizing station theough out the zoo . Not many people around and not crowed at all. There is no place to buy food only a small gift shop. Recommend bringing a drink or buying one before you start at the front gift shop! The giraffe/zebra area has a beautiful covered deck that's high above the ground. Highly recommend stopping there the view, breeze is very nice! Took us about an 1hr 1/2 to finish the zoo so it is very small but worth your time to check it out.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4LWJxeFNnEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Frank+Buck+Zoo/@30.4786865,-105.8819976,6z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x864d00e7c9abb8cf:0xd5bcdd4b9a3dcf52!8m2!3d33.6221057!4d-97.1542782!16s%2Fm%2F0cp0k4c?hl=en",ChIJz7iryecATYYRUs89mkvdvNU,Zoo,5.0,Frank Buck Zoo,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhhDnK5fXg4kVkwaKkSrD52ZEpexf5bKYE0fY=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity
