"Our hotel room was rather disgusting.  The carpet is full of stains and the wallpaper is pealing off of the wall in the bathroom.  As you will see in one of my pictures they have a holder in the bathtub for decent size bottles of shampoo, conditioner and soap.  The holder locks which I assume is so that nobody can steal their products.  However, the soap wasn't in the locked container.  I guess that is so that their guests can carry that soap back and forth between the shower and the sink because that was the only soap in the room.  Also, the large bottle for conditioner was completely empty.  It seemed more like a $59.99 room instead of a $159 room.  Very disappointing.

This could be the worst casino buffet I've ever had. They had prime rib but it was limited to one slice at a time and The Carver would only cut it paper thin.

"I was excited to stay at this haunted hotel until I checked into the hotel. The lady at the check-in deck, didn't get her name, was upset and rude when I asked if I could stay in one of the haunted rooms. This is how our convo went:

Her response: ""we don't have any. Because we aren't haunted.""

My response: ""oh that's not what I read online.""

Her response: ""Idk where you read that because this hotel isn't haunted.""

Keep in mind she is saying this as a total Karen.

My response (joking tone): ""weird. Better not tell you the website then (laugh.)""

Her response: ""no you better go ahead and tell me the website so we can get it taken down. Tell me now. What is it?""

Me: ""idk the website""

Her as I walk outside to get my bags from the car: grabs phone to probably look up website.

Overall, I loved the history of the hotel. Its a shame that they added a casino to the old Ball Room. Vintage is what's popular right now.

The room my family and I stayed in had 2 bedrooms and a kitchen room that had the sink drains covered with a sign saying "" Do not use sink "". The bedrooms didn't have doors. The only bathroom was very small and was in the room with the two beds. The king bedroom used to have a bathroom but the door was locked with a table pushed up against it. In the entry room there was a big closet room where the king bathroom used to be,  which obviously was not useable. The entry door wouldn't lock. I had to stick a folded up card behind the door lock to make it latch properly. I was worried about a fire in the old building. I made sure I knew where the fire escapes were. One was out of a window in the main hallway that led to the fire escape stairway. Room left a lot of room for improvement.
The gambling hall was old but had some new remodeled bathrooms with gold bars and new tile.
The dining room downstairs was very nice. Newer design features with newer bathrooms too.

"Only went for the Grand Buffet. The food was pretty good, the service was fast, and  the interior was nice and had plenty of seating. I had been to another buffet across town earlier in the week and this one is definitely better. There were lots of options for both hot food and a salad bar. There weren't many options for desert. It loses a star because some of the food had been sitting in the buffet for a while and started to dry out, but this is understandable as it wasn't very crowded on a weekday.

Looks like a well maintained‚Äã golf course. It has a nice clubhouse and OK RV park for peaple traveling. I'm not a golfer but I stayed at the RV park.  I saw how well they kept up the golf course.  I stayed in the RV park for two months.  They did not seem good at managing the RV park and at times the management didn't know who was even there.  At times they didn't even dump the trash cans. They sometimes went days without doing this and only dumped them oafter they started overflowing. The golf course was well kept but there was lots of weeds around the RV spaces.  Electrical is included but daily space rates seem high for what they have to offer. This was NOT a dog friendly RV park. They have very poor WiFi service.

Always a great time at Nickelodeon. So many different rides to choose from. I suggest so on a weekday cause weekends are always jam packed. They have Toddler Tuesdays and special deals with that.

Nickelodeon Universe is awsome and amazing. Its more of a thriller ride place but there are some little kid rides. I 100% recommended the Fairly Odd Parents as its fun not to scary and is worth going twice! The photo mentioned is a restaurant we went that was off Nickelodeon called First Round.

"We love Nickelodeon Universe!!!! They've got rides for toddlers, big kids and adults; face painting, caricatures, airbrush shirts. I've taken my kids multiple times and we all love it. Perfect anyday, especially if the weather outside is rainy/snowy/cold. Family friendly. Relatively clean environment. Nice selection of thrill and not so intimidating rides. I haven't experienced it, but they have a quiet/low stimulation room for those with autism as well. We went around Xmas and I was expecting crazy crowds. But it wasnt bad at all. There may be long lines for some rides but they move pretty fast. Most popular rides may have 30-40 minute wait times. There are places to sit and restrooms sprinkled throughout Nick Universe so you dont have to roam through the mall to find relief. Less crowded in the evenings after dinnertime. Wristbands allow all day access and wristband packages let you experience Nick Universal and other attractions like Sea World, Crayola Experience, mini golf, escape rooms, Fly Over America, etc. You can leave and come back to see the universe all lit up.

"I finally got a chance to check this place out. Most of the barcades are in Charlotte so it's nice to have one close to home. I went on a Thursday night which is ""guys night"" and was welcomed as soon as I walked in, both the owners and the guests were very friendly. For Thursdays, about all games were free (at least for dudes) except for pinball, which were .50 a game. Normally it's $5 a person for unlimited play and pinball is $1.00 a game (ouch to $1.00 pinball!). There were maybe 6 to 12 people rotating in and out while I was there, so not crowded at all. Parking was abundant. It's about a 5 minute walk from Freeman's. Bar can turn cash to quarters or can give you quarters from your bar tab for a 10% surcharge. Bar had food and drinks at fair prices. There are 2 gender neutral restrooms. There are a few TV's playing sports and comic book movies and YouTube videos. Place was open until midnight on a weeknight which was cool. There was one tv hooked up to a Nintendo 64 with a pretty large assortment of games. There were a couple party/board games sitting near a table. There was a fairly large area for outdoor seating as well. I think what made this visit special was how friendly the owners and guests were, felt like you were just visiting old friends instead of strangers.

EDIT: Citycade did a reconfiguration and brought in a racing game, a shooting game, a beer pong game and a couple of pay to win games disguised as games of skill. I believe at this point they've gotten rid of the $5 cover entirely and just made the machines take quarters, which I think was a good move. Pinball is still a buck which is a bummer since there are better options out there for $.50 a game, but it's close to home at least and the price point isn't uncommon. Pinball seems maintained and Citycade has occasionally swapped out for different pins, which is nice. Bathrooms are always clean which is a plus. Only complaint is that sometimes it can get a bit hot in the building.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdmFxUllnEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/CityCade+Classic+Arcade+and+Pinball+Game+Bar,+Gastonia+NC/@35.2341215,-81.0537741,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8856c1b3a8efdad9:0xd240e10ee1ba3f55!8m2!3d35.2632135!4d-81.1797882!16s%2Fg%2F11j7k_xln2?hl=en",ChIJ2drvqLPBVogRVT-64Q7hQNI,Bar,5.0,"CityCade Classic Arcade and Pinball Game Bar, Gastonia NC",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOYNN5y6gNITGaKA6YxbJtiodU2YD_0tsylVxD=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

Live animal exhibits were WAY too small for said animals and the care was very dissapointing.

"SUPERB AUTHENTIC THAI in the Pittsburgh area, a short 15 min drive from downtown.  Cozy restaurant with no-touch menu, short and sweet. It looks a popular spot to locals of many persuasions. Takeout or sit in (I have done both), it‚Äôs simply excellent food. A FOODIE‚ÄôS GEM.

Start with Fresh Rolls and Fried Eggplant, contrasting but complementary textures and sweet tangy sauces that wake up the palate (very much unlike the cliche peanut sauce in the run of mill Thai-style places.

Any of the curry entrees are very good, smooth well-balanced sauces; none of that pungent sugar-loaded curry so common in so-called Thai restaurants in this town.

My recommendation: Duck Curry, very crispy well seasoned perfectly cooked duck atop the smooth Red curry with bell peppers and cherry tomatoes, carefully balanced with two halves of lychee just enough to brighten the palate: Simply Wow!

Pair the curry with any of the Thai stir fry veggies.  I‚Äôm partial to the Hot Basil fry, extra veggies (natural sweetness of the fresh vegetables complemented with their brown sauce).

By the way, enjoy Thai food with a spoon rather than fork/knife. Spoon the curry or veggies on rice, mix, then enjoy. Spoon allows one to taste every drop of the sauce.

Great service!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlODVHZThBRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thai+Tamarind/@40.4840871,-80.119055,13z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8834f4f8d66dcee3:0x9f38b06e37d3f35a!8m2!3d40.4912195!4d-80.047499!16s%2Fg%2F1tgk18xd?hl=en",ChIJ485t1vj0NIgRWvPTN26wOJ8,Thai restaurant,5.0,Thai Tamarind,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBCJ7xZJb2Oc-U2O_F0O66mrgbpsgAXzPo61Wm=w150-h150-k-no-p,restaurant
"Well, it wasn't anywhere NEAR as good as a few years back but the presentation was decent. Of course the prices went up, lol. An almost 3 star. Almost. Sadly I can NOT recommend  Thai Tamarind any longer since the flavors were incredibly weak and/or bland; so much tasted like it came from a jar and the top of the line ""thai spicy"" was a powder they sprinkled on top of every dish when presenting your level of spicy. Some of the powder hadn't fully dissolved during your meal so you would gets little clumps of it in your mouth. The ""so-called"" Thai Iced Tea I had tasted as if it were a syrup from a bottle. Yech!

Pictured you have the Tom Yum soup, Volcano Chicken and the Thai Style Chicken Noodle. All bland and weak. Not pictured but as an appetizer we had the chicken satay, another huge let down since when eaten with a homemade peanut sauce or cucumber sauce, it is DELICIOUS! The peanut sauce seems to have some type of dairy added to it. Gross.

Seated WAY in the back corner in the last pic you'll see your ""typical American Ken"", who did nothing but complain from he moment he sat down. Entitled as ""F"".

"I live directly up the street from this place on Washington Ave and I have got to say that I am absolutely disappointed with their quality of food.  Today, I just recently ordered their Pad Kee Mao and it looked like someone chewed up the meal and spit it right back out into the carry out tray.  The noodles were overly soggy and mushed up like mashed potatoes.  The salad that comes with the Lunch looks as if someone cut out a large chunk from a piece of lettuce, threw it into the tray, and then decided to splash a little sauce on top of it.

I don't normally complain about food and most times I simply ignore the mistakes but I've been living in Bellevue for 3 years now and this incident has happened more than once.  A customer can only be patient so many times and then there comes a point where a enough is enough.  This restaurant will never receive my services ever again.  I don't know if it's the cook or the management but the quality of food is poor.  Years ago the food was much better. I'm not sure what happened between then and now.

If you want a quality restaurant for Thai food, go to Niky's Thai Kitchen.  I promise you, Niky's Thai Kitchen is the better choice.  Their food quality is suburb compared to Thai Tamarind, especially for the price you'll pay for it.

"This hotel is AMAZING!! For the price and what you get it is WELL worth it!! My fiance and I stayed here to go to see Brantly Gilbert and Dylan Scott which was very convenient being 15 min away. The rooms were very modern and upscale. Very clean, staff was very friendly and offering assistance throughout our stay. They have a buffet breakfast that was better than any hotel I've ever stayed in. It was real fresh food not that processed stale taste. A chef makes omletes with your fillings right in front of you. They have a upscale restaurant called the OCTAGON it is pricey but well worth it. We had ours delivered via room service!! Their filet mignon is to die for.

You have to walk a long way to your rooms. It would be nice if there was another elevator.

"I've stayed at a lot of Marriotts because of business trips in the past 10 years. They usually don't fall below a certain standard, but it seems in this case they did.

The rooms were pricey and we had booked a room with 2 queen beds and they gave us a room with a king and a sofa bed. Now you might think of this as an upgrade if you had a couple booking the room, but this was for 3 people and getting a sofa bed when you have paid for a queen. When i mentioned this in the app, they said they would fix it the next day and they did, and they have us the room right next to ours which made for a very easy transfer through the connecting door, which is what raised my review from 1 star to 2.

I suspect they changed our booking because they were having a convention and needed the room but this isn't an acceptable reason.

Other things that bothered me were the cleanliness of the rooms. I attached a couple of photos showing what our floor was like in the first room and the dirt inside the coffee maker. In both rooms, the coffee makers were terrible with one even having hair in it.

Finally it saddens me to see a sad attempt to look progressive with 3 places to charge an electric car. 2 Tesla spots of which 1 was it of order and 1 for non Tesla electric cars.

If you want to add electric car charging to your hotel add 10 spots not have a token amount and not even functional

I think they rely on the event housing so much they don't really care about their amenities is status of their rooms so much. Because every night we were there they had all least 2 events going on.

For the price and the quality, might as well just stay in mystic close to everything.

"I had high expectations for this property based on its category and price range. It did not deliver in accordance to its value and how it was advertised. The room I was initially given was not properly cleaned. There were clear signs that the fitted sheet was not laundered. I had to switch rooms, which unfortunately was a downgrade, and there were cleanliness issues in that room as well. The room amenities were lacking, which again is surprising based on category and price. The spa was closed, as well as the hot tub. Those items played a big role in my decision, so I was quite disappointed to find out they were closed. Why didn't the price and category reflect these changes. They are being very misleading, and that's enough to turn me away from Marriott properties. My main concern is they are still advertising as if they have everything together during these times and are charging inflated prices. I am highly upset I did not receive what was expected and now feel like my money put into this property is a major loss. The only thing that was nice is the customer service of the front office staff. The lady taking our breakfast room service order was a little off putting. There was a mistake made with my order. I called to let her know but she seemed upset at me for letting her know their mistake. It was corrected, but her tone was unsettling. The toast was overcooked and stale. Everything else, the omelet, pancakes, chicken sausage, bacon, and potatoes, was made fine.

"I love the Peppermill. They have great food with surprising variety at low prices. I had the inside out grilled cheese. It has baby Swiss, cheddar, tomato, red onion, and avocado on parmesan crusted bread. It was amazing. The onion was flavorful and the creamy avocado made the two melted cheeses even better. The parmesan added another layer of crispness to each bite. I upgraded to tater tots instead of chips, and I was surprised at the large portion. My daughter had a pancake and tots. The pancake was huge, so she only managed half, but she did polish off her tots and some of mine. This was my second time there recently.

Really nice everything brand new really big but long-term price won‚Äôt work. We definitely will be going to the other trampoline places then to come here because of the prices. Arcade is over priced for what you can win. Which is like that almost everywhere. I do love that they have so many couches and lots of areas for the parents to sit and watch kids. Oh and you have to have non-grip socks and they don‚Äôt tell you that when you come in and they do not have prices for the Sox listed on their board either. They are three dollars a pair of socks and they don‚Äôt have any deals on them like if you buy multiple or a pack or anything to save money which is kind of crazy because if I knew beforehand I could‚Äôve bought some online for way cheaper from somewhere else. I like that you have to wear a electronic wristband that has a green and red light to tell you when your time is up. Everything is very Clean because it is a brand new building and equipment.

"Great place, definitely glad to have it near us. Yes it costs more than Hang Time, but it has more to offer. Plus a bunch of couches and several massage chairs for adults.
At Hang Time I'm always worried about where my smaller kids are because you can't keep a good eye everywhere. Feels like it's for older kids and young adults with more trampolines for tricks.

What I like about The Hive it's good for kids of all ages. There's a tetherball with jumping around it. Two interactive video game screens that actually show their picture on screen as they jump, so fun!
Zip line, jumping basketball, targets, go carts (costs extra), the biggest bounce house/obstacle course I've ever seen. Regular trampolines too, rock wall, ninja warrior obstacles, slack line.

There are drinking fountains, but they're by the go carts (kind of annoying they're so far).
They also have bands to wear that have lights that change color when your time is up. They do have lockers as well.

"Nicest roach motel I've stayed at.  It looks cute and quaint from a distance, but don't be fooled into booking a room there.  AC was not adequate.  Had to leave the sliding patio door open for air, which was really hard to move because it was off its rollers.  It was also not secure because the patio is shared with every room on that side of the building.  The room was not clean.  There was trash left from the previous occupant: receipt in the dresser, pizza crust under the bed, comb on the bathroom sink, and water in the ice bucket.  There was a brown crusty substance on the edge of the bathroom garbage can.  The bed sheets were too short and because I'm tall my feet were rubbing on the rough protective pad underneath.  Both beds were like that but I was the only one tall enough to notice.  The map of the grounds they gave us was a bad copy and it was hard to read the amenities.  I thought there might be a nicer version in the amenities book in the room but the book had nothing in it at all.  This means we knew nothing about the hotel other than what was on the bad map.  We didn't have any phone numbers to call for service or if it was possible to order food from the restaurant.  We went in the pool, which had several places where it had cracked and was missing chunks of concrete and tiles.  The deep end separation floaters were all destroyed and were held up by the rope.  We avoided several bad sections of the pool due to it's horrible condition.  When we checked out in the morning it was so early (6:15 AM) that we had to check out at the gift shop and the staff there were not pleasant.  This was also where you payed for gas, and it had the restaurant in it.  The restaurant menu was horrible.  I couldn't order anything due to the limited menu.  The payment system was down and they didn't seem to have a manual backup system so we had to wait, delaying our departure.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3MXNyV053EAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Little+America+Hotel+-+Wyoming/@40.9352574,-121.0446959,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x87508d081348e1f3:0x1293bd51dcf7b000!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d41.5444197!4d-109.858885!16s%2Fg%2F1tdkh3py?hl=en",ChIJ8-FIEwiNUIcRALD33FG9kxI,Hotel,1.0,Little America Hotel - Wyoming,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJQPD1K_dKyxbLfvXtPQolPimu_NjcsLhRwvMQ=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"Hotel is extremely outdated and staff needs to brush up on their customer service skills. The property probably hasn't had any sort of renovation since the 90's and it is long overdue. I was offered a package when I checked in which included a discount if I spent $30 in the gift shop/restaurant/gas station. I was told to bring back my receipts and they would apply the discount. The next morning I went into the front desk with my receipts only to be told I needed to turn them in the night before. I told the front desk attendant that I was not informed that it had to be turned in the same day I checked in, only to bring my receipts back and the front desk lady would take off the discount.  The front desk attendant rudely said,  ""yeah her and she's not here"". I then asked for a manager who quickly resolved the problem. If you're going to have a strict policy on how long customers have to turn in receipts for credits on a package I didn't even ask for then you need to inform the customers of that policy. Additionally, having a bad attitude with a customer who was obviously not informed correctly by your staff will not earn you business. I will NEVER stay here again!

We were in a very quiet unit (no pets). I've heard others say the other units can be noisier (pets allowed) as they are closer to the trucking amenities.

"Myself and 5 friends went tonight to celebrate our good friend's engagement and wedding coming up next month with something a little different! We had an amazing time, the food was totally different than what we normally would find but so good, we had a ton of fun picking out our meals, trying all the different things, and just enjoying the experience. The wait staff was phenomenal, I honestly think Allison was a highlight of our evening. She was very personable, made us feel entirely comfortable, and had great tips and information on the menu.

We were gifted with extras at dessert, champagne for those of us that partook in cocktails and N/A sparkling juice for those that didn't and it was SO good! Super refreshing! We also (seriously, they were so amazing) were gifted a bite of something delicious - I apologize for not remembering what it was by the pastry chef this evening - but it had almonds, was a dessert bar of some sort and it was really good - not super sweet, honestly would have gone great with coffee if any of us had room for it - which we most certainly did not.

The atmosphere was wonderful, even being in proximity to other tables it still felt intimate enough that we couldn't hear other parties' conversations, nor could they hear ours, and I feel like we were a little rambunctious at times. Also, my friends that had cocktails said nothing but high praise for them - my coke with lime was also top notch * in case anyone cared ;)

Food. That's why you're reading this, yeah?
It was good. Like, really great. It also felt like a performance at times. Lots of fun pouring, super attentive taking items away, never once had to ask for anything, be it water, napkin, silverware, etc etc. Maybe we're cheap dates but I'm fairly certain everyone went above and beyond, exceeding our expectations. Thanks for a great experience!

In case my photo captions don't save:
1. Scallops
2. Surprise Carrot & Cardamom Soup option (big fan of this, you don't know unless you KNOW)
3. Beef Medallion Filet - my favorite of the 3 savory dishes
4. The best dang dessert option there is - even though the mousse looked and sounded amazing - I will DIE on this chocolatey-citrus hill any day. Any. Day.

"Really enjoyed our visit here. We came here for the annual fall mushroom dinner and got to taste a great spread of delicacies and unique mushrooms. We enjoyed about 18 different mushrooms blended into our 6 course meals paired with wine! Everything was delicious.

This was our first time here and glad we decided to be here to enjoy the special evening. We got seated right away and the staff were so polite. We also had some food restrictions and our server attended to us right away addressing that. He just made us feel very comfortable and ensured us that the request has been taken care off.

We visited here for dinner but I would love to visit here again during the day because based on the location, it overlooks the beautiful Lake Michigan and I can only imagine how gorgeous the view would be from the hill top! It's an upscale restaurant and is great for special occasions! They offer a lot of speciality themed dinners (just like the mushroom one) so I would really recommend joining in for one of those if you get a chance!

"Our wedding at Lake Park Bistro was absolutely perfect. We had a tented reception with cocktail hour on the gorgeous East Balcony with stunning views of Lake Michigan. The restaurant's white pillars were a perfect location for photos and the surrounding park offered more beautiful options all with in a walking distance. The staff was fantastic and our guests were thrilled with their prompt and friendly service. We also received many, many compliments on the food from our family and friends; even those ‚Äòhard to impress‚Äô said their meal at Lake Park Bistro was the best they‚Äôd ever had at a wedding. However, the best thing about Lake Park Bistro was working with Dan. He made us feel comfortable and welcome every step of the way and provided us with excellent advice to make our day fun and stress-free. Dan was clear in all of our communications and went above and beyond to host a meeting for myself and my other vendors. His honest feedback and recommendations helped make our day personal, special, and truly, the best day of our lives. We truly can not say enough about our wonderful experience at Lake Park Bistro, thank you Dan and team!!

"LPB has been our favorite for a long time and we we're thrilled to learn they re-opened. The service was stellar and VERY safe however we were not quite thrilled with our  food. It was almost as if the kitchen has an entirely new staff.. perhaps new suppliers/wholesalers??  My Oeuf Mollet avec Champignons des Bois was prepared differently, the mussels were definitely different. And my favorite fois gras dish has a new bland fruit or vegetable to accompany it vs the old one which was a sweet fruit that was such a great compliment to such a savory protein. Lastly,  I had a lobster entree that was prepared in a ""beef stock"" like base... Almost like it should have accompanied beef vs. fresh lobster. I hate to sound harsh but I am just being honest.  And FYI the menu is now a set 3 or 4 course menu. We will certainly come back however having eaten here so many times for so many special occasions.. we were a bit disappointed compared to any previous visit.  One last note.. just a thought... Why is it I cannot find a desert chef in Milwaukee who makes Panna Cotta? The last time we found it was at Chistopher's (now closed/new owner perhaps) in Sister Bay.

"It's been a few years since we have stayed here and unfortunately will probably be the last time. I received an email inviting me to stay there which stated they had newly remodeled rooms, which made us want to go ahead and book here instead of our usual other option. Well, our visit was less than satisfying. We drove up Sunday afternoon to check in and were told there was no valet service - park across the street, and walk back to check in (was not allowed to keep my car in their driveway while checking in). Not a good start. Check in line had about 10 parties waiting to check in and only two front desk folks (after about 10 minutes one more front desk agent showed up). Once in the room, I was confused how they could state the rooms were remodeled(?). Bathroom was great (only one hook to hang towels), the room was painted, but the furniture was still old and scratched up, the chair was creaking with every move and the thermostat was very dirty (not huge, but very noticeable). The casino had no live tables, so we had to go somewhere else to play - I prefer to just stay in my hotel to gamble. As far as the 'Resort Fee', it lists 2 water bottles (helpful on a 100 degree day), but never got that - I called down to see if they could be brought over and never got them. There were a couple of coffee pods with a sign stating they will be refreshed every morning, they are not. I called the 2nd morning to get a couple, but ended up running to Starbucks instead (Why are they charging a resort fee???). If this covers the parking, maybe think about charging the people parking in your lot and not staying at your hotel.
In any case, with all the alternative hotels in Reno I will not be booking another room at Circus Circus. I'll keep the old memories of what they used to be years ago.

"I've stayed here twice within the last year, the first time my room in the casino tower was a lot more run down and old than I am used to and I low key had an eerie feeling from the room I stayed in the first time. Maybe something happened there before I don't know, but I felt this odd coldness/a feeling that made me uneasy. I was hesitant to stay here but I decided to book again since I was only here for a couple days.

My 2nd visit this past week was decent. The hotel itself is older of course, but it gives the basic necessities. I was in the sky tower this time and it felt more updated than the casino tower?

Heating/cooling system worked perfectly. I had a corner room which had a nice view of the city.

I would give this rating a lot lower for the incident that happened, but I will assume it was a rare occurrence where someone walks in your room without knocking. The woman Apologized, but I felt really uncomfortable because I could've been naked or in the shower. It was totally inappropriate, I messaged the concierge Ivy person thing and they apologized but never offered to do anything...

Water quality from the faucets were questionable, I ran the hot and cold and both looked heavy, see photo. But cleared up after I ran it for some time.

Shower ran well too. Water temp was well controlled. So everything else was fine with the room. Nothing extravagant, I just got a normal king size room.

Anyways, I like the convenience of the hotels location and how it's connected to the other, Silver Legacy, el Dorado, etc. We enjoy the arcade and circus shows too. Staff are friendly for the most part. They have a better food court now than they did 12 years ago, so there are improvements here and there.

I love that they still have a lot of old mixed with new. I love the history of the buildings and seeing that throughout the halls and rooms of the buildings. Please maintain the history  I think that's what really entices visitors too!

Overall I would stay again for the location for sure.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteDhYQlRREAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Circus+Circus+Reno/@38.1399101,-128.4934264,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x809947369a6d96f1:0x8a35778e09b46c3e!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.5314464!4d-119.8157093!16zL20vMDVnNTAx?hl=en",ChIJ8ZZtmjZHmYARPmy0CY53NYo,Hotel,3.0,Circus Circus Reno,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCZ--N_l0ZFtv1vPawGZHKfTD4R0pU3HNDrLhm=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"Our experience here was awesome! My boyfriend and I did 'The Lost Ship' room. It was a Wednesday 7pm booking, so just the two of us took on the challenge without anyone else booking in. And we escaped with 90 seconds to spare!! Our guide, Captain Charles, did a fantastic job introducing the room to us with this whole back story to set us up. If you pay close attention, there are clues in everything he's saying as well.

The room itself was the best part. It was actually several rooms all joined together and from the lobby you had to figure out how to even enter the main room in the first place‚Äîsuper cool! I had never seen anything like that before. The puzzles were also really well thought out and interesting, using logic and problem solving (not at all abstract or random). Of all the escape rooms I have done, I would say that this has been the best experience I have had because of the attention to detail in the room, the quality of the puzzles, and the experience of being able to solve it with just the two of us.

The room is actually designed for at least 6 people, because it would have been helpful for others to take on and simultaneously solve riddles in the room. I'm pretty amazed we were able to do it with just 2 (but it was mostly because we had a few timely hints... big ones, lol). Awesome experience, highly recommend!!!

Since there‚Äôs so many trees, it was shaded basically the entire zoo, which is a must in the Texas sun.

Love that this is a rescue zoo and their conservation mission. We loved reading about where each animal came from.

Also, since the animals are rescued, they weren‚Äôt hiding like they do in normal zoos. We went as soon as they open, and everyone was out and about in their exhibits.

Our favorite part was definitely feeding the goats and alpacas but it was also amazing seeing lions and cougars that close up!

Every enclosure has a sign with some information about the animal species and also the backstory of this animal specific which I love. I think this provides a lot of education to people.
I love the lions, they were so beautiful, I wish they had a more engaging enclosure same with the bears ( which they are renovating).

And we figured out that it was now feeding time... Very cool to watch the animals come out of their slumber to let the humans know it's time to eat! All the enclosures were large and clean with plenty of stimulation for the animals so that was great to see...
They also have plaques or signs on most of the enclosures with a backstory as to how the animal ended up there, if there was a story to be told.

"This place is amazing.  Talk about taking yourself back in time for a minute you feel like you are in Germany.  They open at 5pm for dinner only.  You drive down this  dark road, and you would never know there was a parking lot and a restaurant from the top of the road.
You go inside from the parking lot on a top level,  down a flight of  stairs is the restaurant.  They do have an elevator for handicap.
Once below it's amazing.  It's small probably about 30 tables, wooden walls, and all decorated with Germany memorabilia.
I was so excited to try this place the last time I had German food was in Germany 20 plus years ago.  I still remember what that tasted like.
There was 2 waitress serving and taking orders. Lisa was our waitress.  She is such a nice lady,  and definitely knows her menu,  and has worked their for a long time.  I ordered the German beer on tap it was very light, clear, and refreshing. My other half Bayrischer Schweinebraten it was a tender slow roasted pork shoulder.  I tasted the dish and it was amazing.  Very tender and with lots of flavor.  It was not sliced it was more like chunk pork. His side was the sliced apples.  I have never tried apples sliced fresh, in a cinnamon sauce.  I wish you could order this by the pint or quart to take home.  Amazing!
I ordered J√§gerschnitzel which was delicious with the cream white wine sauce, and mushroom.  The sauce was so good I asked for a little more sauce. The pork meat was tender, and a nice slice. My sides was potato pancakes oh my goodness hold the fork these were not greasy at all.  I put the sour cream and applesauce on the potato cakes. My other side I was wanting to try was the German potato salad.  It was good, completely traditional,  but not my favorite for my taste buds. Before dinner you have a choice of soup or salad.  I definitely tried the soup which was really good the traditional red cabbage soup.
I can't wait to come back to try more dishes.
For dessert if you have room definitely order the bread pudding with the warm whiskey sauce.  You will want to make room for this dessert.
We were getting ready to leave, they were closing, and they were so nice they make everything fresh daily, and had extra apple and cherry turnovers. I had taken home 1 of each. The next day with a cup of coffee, warmed up,  very good.
I can't wait to come back!

"This is truly a hidden gem!

They have a dance group anyone can join; it's been very fun! Wednesdays at 7PM, except for the 2nd Wednesday each month.  I have literally no dance background, but this is folk dancing, so that's fine üòÅ

Edelweiss is located in German Park at the end of the drive.  The park itself isn't anything major, but the scenery is very nice.
Once at the parking lot, you can go in the main entrance and down the stairs to the restaurant or follow the sidewalk north of the building where it slopes down and around the building to their outdoor seating. You can see a gnome garden along the way!
I've seen comments saying this place isn't handicap accessible, but this sidewalk is the entrance to take if you have a wheelchair or stroller.  Understandably, this will be inconvenient if it is raining.
The outdoor seating is the beer garden area and the doors lead into the restaurant.

On Wednesdays there is a buffet.  I'm writing this review after a stop at their buffet and I'm impressed.
On Fridays they have live music; simply amazing fun!

They have several events through the year and I definitely recommend checking them out! Fr√ºhlingsfest, J√§gerfest, Octoberfest and more!

Through the year, they have several German events, including an Octoberfest.  From what I hear, it's a blast!

Additionally, a local Duolingo group has started holding language events here and, separately, there is a lady who gives basic German lessons in the fall.

"I want to begin by saying I really love the atmosphere. The tables are spaced out enough that there is not much noise and it‚Äôs easy to talk to your table. The interior decoration is also very beautiful. There is not much parking but I live close so I walked. The food was delicious but there were just enough weird things that made me give 4 instead of 5 stars. The bread and butter (which is its own appetizer) is OK but definitely not anything to write home about, the butter pat was cold so not easily spreadable. I ordered the cauliflower main dish with sauce and golden raisins knowing it would be lighter than a meat main. However, with the price of the dish, I was expecting a bit more than 1/4 of a cauliflower head for my main meal. I know inflation and prices are high but cauliflower? Seems they could‚Äôve spared a bit more. Additionally the olive oil cake with rhubarb and strawberry ice cream was good but the ice cream stole the show! The cake itself was just ok and the rhubarb had not been sweetened enough to make it palatable, I ended up taking it off. The service was good but not great, we had a new server and she made a few missteps that ultimately would have cost our party money if we hadn‚Äôt spoken up (as opposed to slow service, etc).

"Fantastic interior layout, private dining area from the bar. My brother and I came here for dinner he was in town and I haven't been here yet so we decided to try it. Food was interesting to say the least, we got the CALABRIAN CHILI CUCUMBERS for an app and it was more tangy like pickled cucumbers. Still very refreshing. I got the SWEET CORN AGNOLOTTI  , charred corn very sweet with shredded crab mix, pretty good however needed a little salt added.
My brother got BRAISED PORK BELLY, cooked an amazin crispy skin , however, this one was overly salted. Not bad but our palette was interesting.
Then we ended with dessert CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE and Seasonal Truffles (3)
By far my favorite I've tried, subtle , flavor isn't overpowering (I don't have that much of a sweet tooth) would definitely get the dessert again! The truffles was alright, dark chocolate and white chocolate. Tasted really nice.

Had previously called Bob to inquire about the course due to the mixed reviews.  Wildwood GC provides exceptional value and we put this course on our play again course whenever we're up here in the Portland area. Our foursome consisted of three Waialae Country Club and one Mid-Pacific Country Club members.  Mahalo Bob for taking great care of us.

Returned to play with some other buddies on May 6, 2017 before heading back to Honolulu the next day after a  five day golfing tour in the greater Portland area.  They were impressed Wildwood is on their ""will play again"" list.  Thanks Tom and the rest of the staff for taking care of us and welcoming us back.

"Just played here on Sunday 10/6, about three weeks post-punching. The greens are fantastic. They're rolling very smooth and true..and at a great speed. They're firm, yet they're holding shots the way they should. Also, the traps were all hand raked, and fairways were very playable.

Look for a new expanded green complex and new lower tee on the par three # 6, and new tee locations on # 7. One thing that always impresses me about Wildwood, is the attention to detail, and the constant reinvestment in the course and clubhouse.

Also, the service is always friendly and accommodating. If you've never played Wildwood, be sure to give it a try. It's a real hidden gem of a golf course, with plenty of interesting holes, lots of character and challenges, and spectacular views.

And finally, Wildwood is in such a peaceful, serene setting, that it has an amazing overall calming impact on my game, as you can see in the photo below, taken at the 15th tee.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdlpMcFlBEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wildwood+Golf+Course/@45.6802797,-124.0292931,9z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x54950078a06c4d17:0x288db95b2eead252?hl=en",ChIJF01soHgAlVQRUtLqLlu5jSg,Golf course,5.0,Wildwood Golf Course,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGy_CYiWqgD3Rvr0qeXgqUXEpgnj33gV2oGSsi=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity
"Really enjoy Wildwood. The course is always in good condition and the prices always seem fair. I play courses that charge more or just as much as Wildwood, but are over crowded and not as pretty. The layout provides variety for the holes. It has a parkland feel that is cut into a hill side. There is only one house that lines the fairway. About half of the holes have an elevated gain at the green or tee box.  It might be a ride for some. If the walk from the first tee box or the walk to the 9th green look steep to you.

"Challenging holes are carved out of the hillside along the river at this course to provide something for everyone. First and foremost there is more vertical change at this course than many I have played in the past. Some pin locations are a hundred feet above the tee box while others are the same downhill. This makes it almost a must to rent a cart if you are playing 18, unless you are in peak physical condition.

The clubhouse is big and clean with friendly staff members to help out with your needs. The range is quite short and narrow, only 200 yards max by about 20 yards wide which makes it hard to warm up for the long shots you will need to be successfull right off the first tee. The carts are older and gas powered which made it tricky to get up some if the steep hills and there is some slow play if you are behind the wrong group.

Insider tip: make sure to study the course before you go if you haven't played here. There are hidden creeks and obstacles that ruin great shots down the middle.

Nestled in the foothills of Forest Park (one of the nation's largest urban pakrs) the gorgeous setting allows unparalleled views. If you find yourself frustrated about your golf game, you can take a moment to see beautiful glimpses Mt. Hood, Mt. St. Helens, and countless other bounties of nature.

Oh yes of course- golf! The course itself is well-maintained, and has its own unique blend of challenges and opportunities. Navigating through a ""normal"" course is challenged in its own rite, but couple that with nestling into the side of a mountain and you have Wildwood!

"Reserved our deluxe king room with jetted tub for Sept 19th back in mid June 2021 & requested a quiet location (if possible). They put us in room 314, which was located on 3rd of 4 floors, right outside of the elevators & across from the ice machine room (very noisy).

The bath towels were thin, rough, and worn (one had two rips on edges... see pics). Jetted tub was the best part of the room, but took forever to fill up. But, for some stupid reason there was NO vent fan in the bathroom! Horrible!

The furnishings were a bit dated & I wouldn't call the size of the king room a ""deluxe"". Reserved that room purely because I knew after a 12 hr drive I'd want to soak in a nice big bath tub. Mattress was comfy, but only 3 squishy pillows (not 4) on the king sized bed (no neck support at all).

I am appalled at the quality of service and food at this place. While a family of Mexicans sitting next to us got served like royalty we were put on the back burner the waitress came over a total of three times while we were there. She also loved to flirt with her boss the whole time while ignoring us! We ran out of chips and salsa asked for more and didn't get any until after we got our food. When I got my plate. The portion was so small ! I had maybe 10 tiny pieces of meat and 4 pieces of shrimp on my dish which was the muscle maker . The lettuce was all brown and nasty. The avocado looked rotten. And not just a normal oxidation brown but it looked like it had been sitting and got rotten and they didn't care. Also only got like three slices of avocado. The dish looked nothing like the picture on the menu. I would have sent it back immediately but the waitress ran off and never even came back until it was to bring  the check. I didn't eat a bite of it and they tried to charge me for it until we talked to the manager! His excuse was they were training them. Yeah whatever. Never coming back here again.

"Our trip was booked several weeks prior to our arrival. The self check in booths were declining many booked hotel guests, stating our rooms weren‚Äôt ready and they‚Äôd emhoyelus when it was. It was alr 6pm, and the kiosks weren‚Äôt accurate! The lines after the mass confusion and frustration began and lasted beyond an hour and some for others, with less than minimal staff at the desk to accommodate the error. This is unacceptable.
Mind you, we are here with my step daughter for a cheer competition, so there are many parents and elementary aged and younger children filling this lobby waiting for resolution.
After we‚Äôre able to get checked in, we come up to our room in the west wing‚Ä¶ seriously the most ghetto room I‚Äôve ever stayed in. I would never have anticipated a casino hotel room to be in such dated/dirty/and sloppy conditions. Bathroom is filthy, tub/shower walls stained and smells like cigarette. Cigarette burn hole in bed linen, and the paint job looks like it was done by my grandchildren. The coffee maker is broken and filthy with thick calcium buildup. There isn‚Äôt a dresser to put our clothes away. Mold in the shower molding.
The pictures on your website do NOT portray an image of the trash hole we walked into last night! We‚Äôre beyond disappointed, and have never had an experience as poor as this at any casino we‚Äôve gone to before. I plan on calling the front desk this morning for some kind of resolution.
Addendum‚Ä¶ step daughter just showed us a used band aid in her bed üò£
Spoke with management yesterday, they returned our phone call after 9 hours, offered us a different room today, however, it‚Äôs after 2pm and the room just now is ready. The replacement coffee maker and clean linen by the folded lump sum came up after several phone calls after 10:30 pm last night.
Manager stated this casino sleeps whatever sum of people and it‚Äôs difficult to keep up and please everyone. Change of room without a guaranteed time and a $50 food and beverage voucher for one of their places within the casino doesn‚Äôt make this stay worth the money I‚Äôve spent at this casino!

"Stayed at the north tower with my boyfriend back in September. There was a horrible storm those two days so couldn‚Äôt venture around AC much but we still had a lot of fun as there is plenty of things to do in the resort.

Room/cleanliness: I‚Äôm a smoker (horrible- I know) so I appreciated there being smoking rooms and smoking areas in the casino so I didn‚Äôt need to go out in the wind & rain just to have a smoke.
The room was in a convenient location. Right above the casino and near the elevators. Our window view was overlooking the casino which was pretty cool. The furniture was a little dated and the cleaning was ehh but that‚Äôs pretty much the case with all smoking rooms in any hotel/resort.

Casino: clean. I saw several employees doing detailed cleaning while playing the slots.

Parking: If staying in the North tower, I recommend using the valet. It was very convenient and the charge for it wasn‚Äôt much.

Staff: no complaints about the Tropicana staff. All very friendly and helpful.

Location: perfect location to the boardwalk and beach. I definitely recommend The Rain Forest Cafe located on the boardwalk.

My only 2 complaints (one was my fault).
1.  was our experience at Hooters there. From the moment we walked in the door, the waitress was very rude. Maybe she was having a bad day but it seemed like she took one look at us and assumed we wouldn‚Äôt tip well (we tip a standard 20-30% (depending on service which I think is very fair). We were nothing but kind to her but she was still extremely rude. The other waitress walking around seemed delightful, I wish she was our waitress instead.
Complaint 2: we went during the week days in the fall so the pools weren‚Äôt open. That‚Äôs my bad for not seeing that in their website. So if you want to use a pool, double check the pools are open.

"We had an overall great experience! Food selections were fantastic. I'd give it a 4 star but we stayed in the West Tower and it is desperate need of a renovation. Wallpaper peeling, we found a cockroach on the wall and the bedding is very poor quality. Room was freezing with no way to change the temperature.
At the casino, drink service at the table games is SOOOO slow and a soda if you go get your own is $5. There should be drink rounds at least every hour, not 3 hours.
Valet service is super slow so give yourself time.
It's vacation though so all of these kind of things happen but some small changescould make this place better!!

"This was my first time at Tropicana Atlantic City. I stayed in the Havana Tower with 1  King size bed.
My first impression--the place is a sprawling monster of a Hotel and Casino resort. From the hotels lobby and check-in located on the lowest level (below the main casino floor accessible by escalators) to my room was a good 10 minute walk. If you have a lot of luggage it's going to be a workout for you. If you can't walk long distances or have any issues getting around, I suggest getting a room closer to the lobby and casino floor. The walk to my room involved many long inclined hallways, a pass through the shops and restaurants in the Quarter  and finally to the Havana Tower.
My room was big and looked very inviting and clean. But upon further inspection, it had it's share of problems. Smudges and  crud and on multiple door jams, and the bathroom vent and the room In-take A/C vent were disgustingly dirty. It looked unhealthy. (See pics)  Not sure if it is mold or just thick black dust but it should be cleaned REGULARLY. Besides that, I wanted to simply relax and take a shower but there was no body wash or hand soap for the sink. I called house keeping and was told they would be sending some up to the room immediately. I waited for over an hour and nothing showed up from housekeeping. Had to call again.  Someone showed up 30 minutes after that. (My stay was on a Wednesday and it took that long to get something that they forgot to put in the room. I can't imagine how long I request, like body wash or simply extra towels, would take on a weekend.
The hotel immenities are a pool and a very impressive  entertainment, shopping and restaurant area called the Quarter. It boasts over 24 restaurants, 25 shops of various goods and 22 bars and clubs and other entertainment like an Escape room.
Overall, despite the bad cleaning and service delays   from the housekeeping department,   I would recommend this hotel.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dDR6Wk9BEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tropicana+Atlantic+City/@37.5346621,-86.6444706,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89c0ee64503d341f:0x5ae59bb688f27ccb!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d39.3523692!4d-74.4445618!16zL20vMDVnNXJt?hl=en",ChIJHzQ9UGTuwIkRy3zyiLab5Vo,Hotel,4.0,Tropicana Atlantic City,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCIvOMm7ONTLCiydZBDGL4zD5nxUpWdu7YCWL5=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel
Some rooms are just ok...and some rooms and suites are very good. No room service but some of the restaurants in the building deliver.

"So far, not so good. Self check-in kiosk put us in a double when we reserved a king. Currently waiting in line in the South Tower Lobby, a long walk from the Havana Tower where we were, for assistance in rectifying the situation.  We have already had to change our dinner reservation at Ossu. I will update once we are settled. Not getting better: only 1 person working the counter. People behind us have been waiting for an email that their room is ready for an hour. Wow.
8:30 and Gary is now helping us. ""The Kiosk wouldn't make a mistake. Whatever room you booked is the one you got.""
Except it's not the one we booked and, oh look, we have the confirmation.
""Well, if a king bed is important to you,I can put you in the North Tower. ""
Yes, since it is what we booked, we'd like the king.
So, we're in the king on the 17th of the North Tower. It's fine. Smells vaguely of cigarettes and marijuana, but it's  AC so... We may make our new reservation at 9.
I'll update tomorrow,  but at this point, my advice is avoid this property.

Good morning. Final update: The bed is pretty soft, but would be fine if there was any substance to the pillows, or if there were more pillows (4 small ""feather"" pillows on a king bed with no extras in the closet).
The temperature was impossible to regulate to any satisfaction. See the picture of the 70's technology thermostat.
The shower looked beautiful, however the design is awkward and it functions poorly.

We come to AC plenty and took a chance on the ""New"" Tropicana on this visit. This was a mistake.  Stay somewhere else.

It seemed that several of the concrete pads were not level, we noticed an RV with both of its front tires off the ground after being leveled. We enjoyed kayaking but found strong and irregular currents in front of the PUD building. We didn't notice any real beach, but maybe the tides were off while we were there.

Not for me but others really enjoy this restaurant. To me the food is only okay compared to the high price. My parents however come here for the nostalgia and environment. My mom had the pecan crusted chicken which she said was ‚Äúone of the best meals‚Äù she ever had. My father and I had the brisket sandwich which was good. The cheese is definitely the best part of this place however my one complaint is that it come out in plastic salad dressing containers.

"The husband and I have decided to set off and try a new place where we have never ate before every Friday for date night, with that being said we found ourselves here. My first impression wasn't bad at first. It was very beautiful when we walked in. A little confusing because you choose if you'd like to eat in the Diner or Pub and each menu was a tad different (as they did show us) but I was still confused so I just said Diner so we could get to eating. After about a 20 minute wait we was finally placed into a corner but at this point I didn't care, I was just ready to eat. We ordered our drinks and appetizers, those took about 15 minutes to receive. I immediately noticed that the glass was dirty, still at this point I'm trying to stay positive. I calmly wait as we wait for our waiter to come back so I can express my concerns to him unfortunately he took about 20 minutes before he came back in that 20 minutes we watched others get drinks numerous times and their food as we still set there waiting to just get one more drink, at this point I'm getting annoyed. Right about then a manager walk by and I expressed my concerns to her and she immediately address the issue. We finally receive our food from our original waiter and to be honest the burger was okay it didn't have much flavor at all but at this point I'm still trying to stay positive and look at the positive like at least the fries are good right? Just overall not a good experience I don't think I would ever go back there again the manager however did come up to us and offer us a free dessert to take home and we kindly took it home with us to enjoy later.

"Visited from out of town and spent family time at the Dakota Zoo.

I'm used to bigger zoos that are very crowded and the animals are 20 feet away.  I was expecting to see animals I see at my home zoo; I was wrong.  The variety and habitats of the animals is fun and interesting.

The zoo was not crowded.  My family could wander around at their own pace.  The zoo is very well covered by trees which provide shade in many places.  The paths are a bit run down, but fine for wheelchairs and strollers.  We did not have a map of the zoo which made it confusing to me.  My daughter knew her way around and there are info signs periodically to show the exhibit locations.

"For a view of Mount Shasta, this place was one of the best in town. It was centrally located, within walking distance to most of the restaurants in town. The rooms itself could use some freshening up, not really outdated, just looked a little tired. Couldn't tell if the refrigerator in the room was working, didn't seem to get particularly cold and there was no adjustment. The restaurant was good but do yourself a favor and DO NOT PURCHASE THE PRE PAID BREAKFAST PACKAGE. They charge you $20 per person for breakfast. You get your choice of one entree and one drink. My wife ordered the Granola and coffee and wanted a bagel. She was told that she would have to pay extra for the bagel even though the total with the bagel wasn't over $20. You're better off paying as you go because you don't get the difference if your total is under $20. Staff was friendly and helpful. Overall, our stay was ok, I'd stay here again if I were in town but I wouldn't pre pay for breakfast again.

Just got a response from Best Western. They state that their breakfast package are $10 for adults and $5 for children. Going through Bookings.com we were charged $20 per person. Our total for breakfast for the 5 days we were there was $200. I will say breakfast was good but not $200 good.

"Pros:
LOVE LOVE the Best Western Tree House! Will stay again!

Loved the cabin-esque feel with the high ceilings.

It was great that you could get to the lobby and restaurant all internally.

Great views of the snow capped mountains from our window.

Great prices at the restaurant but there weren't menus readily available. Nice diner to sit down to eat.

Close enough to popular attractions like Burney Falls and McCloud Falls.

Rooms with external door and kitchenette options available.

Felt safe here.

Ryan was great at check in.

Cons:
Pricey but better than all the other hotels around.

Heating/Cooling system didn't work very well.

Pool and hot tub closed due to Covid.

"This was a great condo & beach facilities. We went on the jet ski, had pi√±a coladas, swam in the pool, cooked breakfast in the room and slept comfortably in the bed.

Please keep in mind the border in that area closes at 8pm SHARP from the Arizona side so get there with plenty of time for a line up. Also ‚Äî watch out for sand storms in the area, we encountered one and it was a doozy that would have been very uncomfortable if we weren‚Äôt already in the taxi!

We came for 4th of July weekend and our friends booked our Airbnb here at Las Palmas I love the resort entirely! First time in Puero Penasco! So walking from the Condo to the beach was just a few mins so close by the beach. Our view was amazing & breathtaking! The resort pools we absolutely loved and enjoyed. They have the kid family pool area which is impressive cause they have really cool slides and shallow area for littles. Plus offer his eats and antojitos while swimming and lounging. The resort has zero tolerance for partying too late and loud obnoxious ppl will be addressed or kicked out so I like that too.

"Ummm I probably wouldn‚Äôt come here because of the security, they were super strict, couldn‚Äôt do much but then again it‚Äôs their job, but they made us feel uncomfortable. We booked on Expedia which then brought me to Virbo and I had to create an account and the owners name is Tom. It was a little confusing but figured it out.
The apartment was very spacious and clean,to bedrooms and a set of bunk beds, it had everything you need such as laundry soap, condiments, utensils, plates etc. So we were able to grocery shop for the week.
When you go to the pool, the kiddie pool is not warm and there is an adult pool for night. The beach is beautiful but there is always a low tide so you will have to walk a little to get to the water.
The town is not fully developed, so don‚Äôt expect a Cancun experience but you will find authentic Mexican food when you drive into the town.
In the tourist area of Puerto Penasco, they sell very expensive souvenirs, charging in American prices.

The wait for food is never long, even if the place is full. You can dine in at lunch and get back to work quick. The menu items consistently taste amazing and are prepared the same way everytime... there are no surprises, if you order an Olympic roll it's going to be amazing Every Single Time, and that surely can not be said for the other places in town.

If you go between 12 and 4 the special is ""get 1 special roll and get a second at half off"".

"If you are looking to stay at a top-notch hotel. The Best Western Premier Bridgewood (Neenah) is an excellent choice. Our family of 4 stayed here recently while on our family vacation and stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which is a must for us with two teenagers. Each of the kids had their own bed in their own room, we had a separate room with a king bed and there was also a spacious family room. Three 65 inch tvs in each space kept everyone entertained during our downtime. The room was clean, nice and spacious. The hotel itself was very clean and nice in all areas. The pool is nicer than average hotel pools featuring a shallow wading pool for small children and main pool with basketball hoop and a larger slide for older kids. Two hot tubs one indoors and one outside were nice and relaxing. On site restaurant was very good and convenient to get to within the hotel.

My family came here as opposed to a big waterpark hotel to hopefully experience a smaller crowd and quieter atmosphere to get away in the winter cold. The stay was overall enjoyable. The rooms felt very clean and we were comfortable. The pool area had everything our kids needed. The water was very warm and that is definitely a plus.

"Main takeaways: not worth the price, but the kids did have fun. The exhibit was small, very warm (no ac even in Summer), and the main thing is that the dinosaurs appear to be inflatable? And in very poor condition (missing teeth, hair and feathers missing in large patches, sections of the inflatable not working etc.) the lighting is also very low and odd. It seems designed to be scary and colorful maybe, instead of actually being able to see any detailing on the creatures. I paid $25 per person (including the kids) and you can see the exhibit in 15-20 minutes (reading all of the educational material). It just isn‚Äôt worth it.

The only reason this isn‚Äôt a 1 star or a complaint to the organization for a refund, is that the kids did have fun. The dinosaurs are touchable (probably why they are in such terrible condition). And there is an interactive coloring program at the end that is pretty good (but even that was glitchy.)",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa2NqSDJRRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dino+Safari+Boston:+A+Walk-Thru+Adventure/@42.9161377,-71.8822557,9z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e371a4e43be949:0xf28f02a7abf984e2!8m2!3d42.3597994!4d-71.0545357!16s%2Fg%2F11p676q92g?hl=en",ChIJSek75KRx44kR4oT5q6cCj_I,Exhibit,2.0,Dino Safari Boston: A Walk-Thru Adventure,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMujw1pvPz8j8jaU-OkcvqrIkqfnwxDMa6mHDxN=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"NOT WORTH THE COST!!!
Save your money, and use the $25 for something that is more than 10 mins long. Also for $75 we could have   had hours worth of fun some where else in the city rather than 10 mins.

Is it a fun experience for children ages 3 to 12, yes! If money is NOT a worry for you then go and enjoy yourself. Our child had a great time for the 15 mins. However, $25 for adults and children is absolutely ridiculous. At BEST this is should cost $12 for adults $5 for children.

The only reason they can get away with charging such an absurd price is because it is in Faneuil Hall.

"Typically I am quite skeptical about these corporate run places or attractions like this. Especially when they're located in a mall or something of that fashion. In my opinion they tend to be more of a gimmick than an actual fun and educational experience.
That being said, you should also know that if you're expecting something like one of those very large public aquariums that everyone raves about, this very much isn't that in any way shape or form (and that's okay). It is however much larger than what you might be anticipating if you're basing things on how the outside of the building looks.

I say all of that, to say this. Even though this place isn't of the caliber of many major city aquariums, it does have to some great qualities for what it is. I wound up here because my Fianc√© and I decided it would be a good weekend adventure for the kids, and as it turned out, we were right.

One of the major perks right off the bat is the fact that they often are only taking guests that buy tickets in advance (at least this was the case while we were there), meaning it is much less busy than it would be if they were letting everyone walk up and buy tickets. I feel that this really made for a less congested and more personal experience with the kids.

I don't know exactly what I was expecting for the price of a ticket here, but I do feel like it was absolutely worth it, not only for the kids, but for the adults as well. There were certain periods throughout the experience that I think I was probably more excited to see a certain animal than my ten year old son was. The way this place is set up is basically you're in an undersea maze where you continue on, learning about and seeing all sorts of creatures, eventually ending up at the end (a.k.a the gift shop). There are also parts where you're able to interact and be hands on with certain sea creatures, and that was pretty entertaining as well.

There are not only quite a few creatures (both salt and freshwater) to take a gander at but also several activities for the kids to take part in during the whole experience. This place also makes it incredibly easy to be able to see everything no matter how big or small you are (you'll see what I mean when you walk through). You might even get the opportunity to see several of the creatures eat, which can be quite fascinating. Specifically the Stingrays, I mean have you ever seen a Stingray eat? Probably not, and you totally have the ability to here.

When all is said and done, should this act as a replacement for those gigantic public aquariums that many cities have? Absolutely not, but oftentimes not everyone has access to those places or those specific aquariums, and this would probably be the next best thing in my opinion.
The staff here is also friendly, professional, and seemingly quite knowledgeable about the sea creatures they keep, which was refreshing to see.
I truly believe that if you can separate the fact that you're not going to get the full ""aquarium"" experience that you might get at those other very well known gigantic aquariums, then you can truly have a great time here, especially if you bring the kids.

"Great location to have an aquarium! The Great Lakes Crossing Outlets are still thriving, unlike so many other malls in the Midwest. Sealife Aquarium is right next to Rainforest Cafe, which is fitting.

The exhibits are nice, the ambient music is soothing, and the lighting really makes the exhibits and fish GLOW. This is a small aquarium, but they managed to put A LOT to see and enjoy into it.

There is a small gift shop, places to sit, interactive exhibits, and decent-sized and adequately cleaned bathrooms.

There isn‚Äôt a food area, but with Rainforest Cafe and the food court, it‚Äôs not necessary.

The price of admission was decent. Due to Covid, it‚Äôs necessary to schedule your time slot. I appreciated the ability to choose a time, as we went on a Thursday at 11:00am, so we could take our time and not be ‚Äúcrowded out‚Äù.

"Came here originally on my birthday last year . The food is just amazing. The chef / owner is from Italy and knows how to cook. The homemade pastas were amazing , the staff knew what kind of wine my wife needed , as their wine menu was very overwhelming. Huge wine menu lol .

My wife wanted come back on Valentine‚Äôs Day weekend on a Saturday , and it was such a lovey experience ..... we started with the fried calamari. It was crunchy and tender. Got a nice $30 of Cabernet and it was smooth. I don‚Äôt really drink wine but I was able to drink a whole bottle with wifey . Next we got a shrimp / crab dish and 4 cheese ravioli. Outstanding entrees. Didn‚Äôt look like much but we were very stuffed . Last was our lime something cake ....

We did come at 8pm so the crowd died down so our service was pretty spot on .

Love love love this place !

Just came here on a Monday for my bday and it was perfect ! When we got there at 6pm there was only us and another table. We practically had the restaurant for a good 30 minutes to ourselves . Usually this place is packed but probably due to covid it has slowed down. They closed their larger dining area. We had a bottle of wine , few appetizers , and two main courses ! Our food was awesome ! And service was great ! Wish it was busier so the restaurant stays in business.

Meatballs and the sauces were very good!!! The other entrees portions are all too big. Seafood risotto was not bad, I would prefer the seafood not cooked so much that they were a bit chewy.

We all laughed over the one giant piece of ravioli, that was not expected. It smelled really good and was told that it tasted very good too.

They have a large menu of wine by glass and by bottle. Cocktail menu was pretty standard.

"Today my family and I arrived at Golden Corral in Sterling Heights Michigan and were extremely disgusted with what we saw.

After paying (over $60) we finally found a table that was clean. When we went to the bar, we saw nothing but food thrown all over the floor, the bar was disgustingly dirty, and completely empty. Servers and the manager were just walking through the food all over the floor, never cleaning anything at all. It was so bad, I decided to take photos as well for you.

After sitting down, it took us 15 minutes to get silverware, and over 25 min to get drinks. Our server never cleared the plates from our table when needed either.

As for at the bar; the woman doing the steaks was more interested in flirting and trying to get a date with a customer than actually helping customers, cleaning anything, or even putting steaks on the grill. The salad bar was basically full of rotting fruit and slimy lettuce.

At the desert bar, there was chicken on the floor, food everywhere. My biggest concern was the fact that there were peanuts all over the bar, mixed into other toppings, on the cookies, on the brownies, etc. As someone with an extreme nut allergy, this type of cross contamination is deadly, let alone disgusting.

For $60 my family and I ate one plate of food that was cold by the time we got our silverware because the bar was empty and never refilled. I understand that places may be short staffed but that is not an excuse for any of this. If the health department would have walked in, the place would have been closed immediately‚Ä¶.and honestly should have. When the manager, the staff, the servers, and guests are having to walk through food on the floor and nothing is being cleaned or refilled, that‚Äôs awful. We have been here several times and this is the most disgusting restaurant I have ever seen.

"Rarely do I give a bad review ....but....
Disgusting.  If only zero stars were available.  Place needs a full cleaning. Maybe rip out disgusting carpet and try vinyl flooring... Plastic cutlery? Maybe since covid?   But had to ask for it vs getting at payment and entering.
Many tables were not wiped down without asking after awaiting a significant time. Unused tables stacked with piles of dishes. This st 4pm so not a full dinner rush.   I'd hate to see it during rush time.

The buffet had many empty pans due to non attention.

I've been  to several Golden Corral in many other major city centres. And this so far by far has been the worst!

The lunch items seemed to be better but onenof my guest became ill  upon eating the soup that they warm in the tray tables during breakfast.  Food was visibly dry and looked as if it was from yesterday.

We used to love coming to this place especially on a friday! Now a days days the food quality has dropped tremendously. The options of which they serve you is bare minimal or cold. Went to get meat on friday there is no special meats any longer. The ham and ribs were cold. Steak used be a better quality as well. Salad bar doesn't include bacon anymore? No mk or chocolate fountain. Only 2 pie selections. As I said the quality used to be better. All of these are things noticed by my child it's her favorite restaurant. My waitress was awesome ty Brittany. Over all the food was def not fresh all but the steak the options were slim and not very tasty. I tried a little of everything even the bourbon street chicken used to be better. I understand that sometimes business is slow but this was dinner rush 6 pm to 7pm .

"Would highly recommend this great little Campground. The property was clean, very well kept, and had everything you could need. Play Set for kids, cozy tent & RV sites, coin operated showers, laundry, dishwashing station and even a place for fishermen to clean their catch. Convenient store with the basics as well as some handmade goods and local foods. The quaint little grill in the back makes a mean burger and has tons of food options. I enjoyed the seafood basket which was plentiful (shrimp, clam, scallops & fries).
Everyone we came into contact with was friendly and helpful. The only downside I might mention is that there is only of toilet and one shower for the whole park. We came in the off season, so this was no big deal. Not sure what it would be like in the busy season.
Overall a great place and we loved our stay! Will be returning for sure! Location is key and this place is perfectly situated between, Rialto Beach, La Push, Forks, & the Hoh. Didn‚Äôt hurt that they fully embrace the Twilight mania that has over taken this area either. I was here for the National Park, but am also a Twilight fan, so I really enjoyed all the little Twilight touches they had. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwb1Bfc0F3EAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/3+Rivers+Resort+%26+Guide+Service/@45.7036614,-127.7180914,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x548e7e59abe9c5ff:0x9108a6eada4a7cef!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d47.9131228!4d-124.534736!16s%2Fg%2F1th631y4?hl=en",ChIJ_8Xpq1l-jlQR73xK2uqmCJE,Resort hotel,5.0,3 Rivers Resort & Guide Service,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHZMPcjxqVOkBC6XMYqG6IHosh3mpz1mIb6HUA=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"This place was a recommendation and man are we glad we listened! It's a little hole in wall joint. Has a pretty good size menu. You order at the front and can take a seat and wait. They have a Twilight themed menu for those visiting for fun(; I had the Bella Bananas Split and it was amazing. I'm a vegetarian and had a few options which was nice. I had a salad and my husband and kids had burgers. There was hardly any crumbs left. The onion rings were AMAZING. Beer battered and fried to perfection. There is four of us and we each got a meal with sides and everyone got a dessert for $50 bucks the prices were very fair. The workers were all so nice and friendly. We will be coming back for sure!!!!!!

If visiting for Twilight they also have a Treaty Line sign across the street and a few different tourist items to check out!!!!

There is a single stall shower in a small room, it is self serve, you just need quarters. 4 minute showers available for $2.00, 5 for $2.50 6 for 3.00 and 7 for $3.50.

"MOLD AND TERRIBLE HOUSEKEEPING!!! Front desk has great customer service. Kayla was very attentive and has great customer service. I stayed ten nights and housekeeping would show up every other day. I had to do my own bed, and take out my trash on the days that no one would show up. On the days that they showed up it was around 4 PM and in a bad mood. I talked to a manager by the name of Kyle three times and he did nothing about it. My shower was never cleaned even though I mentioned to the housekeeping lady that I had mold in the shower.

"You will miss your bed at home real quick! The only thing keeping me from giving a two star or worse rating was the fantastic customer service: front desk, housekeeping, and the breakfast attendant. Otherwise this Hilton-brand Hampton Inn and Suites is not worth the higher price point than many of the other options in Aberdeen and is way overdue for a refresh (maybe we can blame Covid-19). The colors and finishes in the lobby, halls and rooms are dinged, scuffed and just plain ugly. The king-sized bed in our non-suite room was caving in and needing replacement. When booking, be aware not all the rooms are like the pictures on the site, some are very plain with no kitchenette, just an awkward mini fridge and microwave by the desk in the room. No real dresser if you like to unpack just a small hutch with sticking drawers that the TV sits on. Pull out style love seat sofa seemed like a great option for the kids, but the window was very drafty and our son about froze the first night. The blankets were very thin waffle weave style. We asked for a second for the next night and he put on extra clothes and was okay. Not comfortable enough for an adult, he slept on it backwards, because even he could feel the metal. The bathroom was a good size which was nice for a family traveling with younger kids, but the bathroom fixtures were loose and the shower almost didn't work. The toilet took several flushes. The pillows in our room weren't the usual mixture of firm and soft (feather and polyfill as it turned out for here), but housekeeping brought us new ones when we inquired at the front desk during breakfast. The breakfast was quite good. Many choices, including an oatmeal area with fixings, plus other hot options, waffles, fresh fruit, yogurt, biscuits and gravy one morning and the next eggs and sausage patties. Coffee options were hot. Pool and hot tub area was small, but we had fun anyways. Pool towels were restocked regularly. Elevator floor became sticky one evening, but as we were in and out, right away they had it mopped I noticed. Again, great customer service that way. We also did laundry which was weirdly on the second floor off in the corner, kinda creepy, but washing and each dry cycle was just a dollar in quarters.

"Let me begin by saying that Evermore has such great potential!
The young ladies who greeted us at the front entrance were incredibly helpful! Rebecca and Lee - 5
The young ladies at the archery -5
The haunted house- 3 very creative
Park set up: 4
Park amenities: 1
It is not disability friendly at all!
I asked to rent a electric scooter
I have ms and it‚Äôs difficult to walk.
Someone stole the one scooter they had? üòÜ lol thats a first
Food- 1
What a joke. They have a very nice restaurant set up
But it only serves 2 desserts that could pass for McDonald‚Äôs $1 desserts
They have smaller getups
They open at 6 food (can beef stew and Mac n cheese or chicken nuggets and fries sold out by 8
We had to wait literally 30 min and another 30 min for chicken nuggets
The food definitely not amusement park quality.
Park Combo- 1
The train ride was down
I asked for a bottle water to go towards my drink
I was handed a warm bottle of water straight from the case of water plastic bag!
The guy was literally opening the can of beef stew while we waited lol
They also had a microwave
$1 dessert
A large bread bowl with a small scoop of canned beef stew

"I visited evermore on a Friday evening with my husband at the start of Mythos season. We ate at Vander‚Äôs keep to start our evening. I recommend the butter toffee beer! It has a horchata-esque creamy cinnamon taste to it. Yum! I wish there were free refills. We tried the poutine, patty melt and deer meat. It was all delicious except the vinicent was kinda nasty, a crazy flavor if you aren‚Äôt expecting it! The prices were also more steep than I was expecting.
Then we ventured into the park itself. We wandered up the eastern side and noticed lots of unfinished buildings and construction, so our first impression wasn‚Äôt the greatest. But then we stumbled upon the renaissance fair activity area with archery, knife throwing, and dueling and that was a blast! We loved exploring the mausoleum and talking with the evermorians. It was fun to chat with the barmaid while taking shelter from the cold air. I liked how compact the park was so that you could run around completing quests and not get too worn out.
The hand crafted shops were fun, some prices more reasonable than others.
Overall a fun experience that is very unique! I only wish they would give you a guide/notebook with the activities listed, times, and conversation starters so that wasn‚Äôt so confusing. With some more work this place could be amazing. I can‚Äôt wait to see how it develops in the future.

Pros:
-Delicious Restaurant Food
-Evermorians are entertaining to interact with
-Fun buildings
-Feels like you are in a different world
-Max the Macaw!
-Ticket price is great

"I'm between a 3 and a 4 star experience here. The actors are fully committed and extremely fun to interact with. Most of the site is fairly polished but there are some areas in need of tlc ( boarded up buildings etc) The concept of this place is so fun and I love the welcoming feel for all types. Very fun to see all the different guests dressing up. Some major pain pains were the confusing ""quests"" and the difficulty in finding an adult beverage on the property. Our group had no idea how to go about ""joining a guild"" or in ""completing a quest"" that was mentioned at the entrance. Some people in our party wanted to grab a drink while there and the only place was the onsite restaurant. When we asked at the front they told us we could sit at the bar and grab a drink as long as we purchased food ( standard utah law) but when we went inside they said we needed a reservation and we couldn't sit at the bar until after 9:45pm ( not a utah law requirement fyi) pretty annoying. We ended up making a reservation and wow, the food was super over priced and extremely underwhelming. We ended up sending back the chocolate cake (super stale) The drinks were watered down and not worth the price, the time it took to get to the table and the hassle. The restaurant wasn't even half full and was still soooo slow. Cool one time experience but until they work out the annoyances it's really not worth the $19  per person fee.

Some of our group really enjoyed the fright walk (think haunted house) and the vendors had a lot of really cool stuff. Overall everyone was friendly and made the experience well worth it.

"So this last Saturday the 4th of June was me and family's first time at Evermore. Holy heck did we have a blast. And we didn't even really do everything. There truly is so much to do and enjoy for everyone.  My daughters ran on quests to join the rogue elves guild, my 4 yr old joined the fairy guild and won the kiddo costume contest and my son who has no idea about fantasy dove right in when in the arena lol. Not knowing how to really interact made it a challenge but the Evermorians there made it really easy to do when they engaged with us. So even if your shy and nervous and dont know what to do someone will send a smile and interact with you, but its up to you to interact back just play with it and have fun.
Diego the orc was an absolute blast and my family chatted with him every chance they got.  All the fairys knew my daughter by name and would say Hi every time they saw us walking around. Sir Darlan as well took it upon himself to show her how to use a foam sword when she nervously asked him if she could touch the swords by the dueling area. Basically I just wanted to be able to say a true thank you to all involved for making this trip a truly memorable experience and one that will be repeated in years to come. And for any unsure about the experience don't over think it and just dive in and wander around there's so much to enjoy for everyone. I can't express it enough and just wanted to share it, thank you, thank you,  thank you from the Boyer clan.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeW9feUNnEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Evermore+Park/@48.4574485,-136.1145064,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x874d83f71c8d8573:0xd2b1550509192d2!8m2!3d40.3585186!4d-111.7655992!16s%2Fg%2F11gtg87wp5?hl=en",ChIJc4WNHPeDTYcR0pKRUFAVKw0,Theme park,5.0,Evermore Park,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMV9nx3QjA6ODwxJOTTbMaNiD7FpaBBcs1HHNxa=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"Here‚Äôs some helpful info if you‚Äôre going during Aurora/Christmas time. We were able to get into the park pretty quickly; there were two lines - one for buying tickets and one for scanning them if you purchased them online (which we did). So we only had to stand in one line. We decided to get the meal included in our combo passes right away and ended up waiting 30+ minutes in a crowded line at Kettle Cafe to order and get our food. We were incredibly lucky because we found a 4 person table that cleared inside with 3 seats so our kids were able to sit there and my husband and I stood shoulder to shoulder to eat our food. Most people probably had to eat outside in the freezing cold. They told us they were out of desserts, so we didn‚Äôt get to order them. But lo and behold, the dessert window was full of fresh new desserts just a couple minutes after we got our food. This was frustrating because we knew we‚Äôd have to wait in yet another line to get the desserts included in our combo passes.
The wait for the train ended up being 55 minutes, plus a couple more sitting on the train waiting for it to go. This was pretty excruciating because it got down to 15 degrees the night we were there and there was no heating in the line which is covered by a roof but fully outdoors. We had really bundled up but it was still super cold. Our kids were troopers and hung in there because they really wanted to ride the train, which of course ended up not being worth a 10 minute wait let alone nearly an hour long wait in sub freezing temps.
So after we got that out of the way, we waited in the confectioner shop for cookies since we weren‚Äôt able to get the desserts we‚Äôd waited for earlier in the evening. Another 10+ minute wait but at least it was indoors which was actually pretty nice because we couldn‚Äôt feel our fingers or toes by then (we were all wearing thick socks, snow boots, and gloves just for the record).
We spent a short while exploring outside but weren‚Äôt clear on where to go to do a quest. The map on the website isn‚Äôt very helpful because you can‚Äôt zoom in and actually read the words on it.
Going to Evermore is something different to try at Christmas time, but a lot of waiting in lines if you want food and especially if you want to ride the train.

They offer decent rental equipment so you can bring your buddy, or for yourself if you're not convinced to make the investment in your own gear.
They offer food, and drinks at the field at fair prices and the field paint is reasonably priced also.

If you come, make sure to check out Horn Hollow cave. There‚Äôs a short little crevice near the main entrance of the cave, and if you follow that, it narrows and narrows. Prepare to be crawling on your stomach in an underground creek. You‚Äôll need to be pretty narrow and pretty flexible (I‚Äôm 6‚Äô and 180 lbs. and I made it though with some difficulty). It goes back a good 200 feet, until it opens up on this huge underground waterfall fueling the creek. It‚Äôs almost as big as the one in Cascade.

The party rooms looked cute, but i just peeked in through the windows. My kids were SUPER disappointed that the ball activity wasn‚Äôt working! And the entire place could use a good cleaning for sure. Once of the couches is broken and sagging.. and multiple chairs are cracked. The tables and chairs are white, and suuper  dirty.

"Gaia House Cafe was very nice. The decor is slightly bohemian and very cozy with mismatched chairs and tables.We went on a Tuesday at lunch and got the Gaia Tempeh Ruben and the Banh Mi sandwiches.The coffee was excellent. The staff was very pleasant and the food arrived in good time. The price seemed a little steep for sandwiches but when you get homemade pickles and kraut it makes up for it. I couldn't tell where a good place to park would be, so we parked in the Irish pub reserved area with a risk of towing.

Some things to consider: add a bit more spread on the Banh Mi as it was a little dry; add a few completely vegan options to the menu as many of the entrees are so close but then have cheese; swap out those potato chips for a cup of soup.

"Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have anything good to say about Gaia house . When we were sat down there was paint bubbling near us, probably due to moisture trapped behind the paint. And then a leak above. It‚Äôs not really an appetizing sight.

We were told that we wouldn‚Äôt be able to have espresso or lattes because the espresso machine was down. That‚Äôs fine. What I did take issue with was the self serve coffee station. For one, the way the glasses were stored was gross. The shelves were not clean. The cups were freshly washed. I could tell because they were wet, placed rim down. So that the dust and debris on the shelving was collected on the wet rims of the cups. And whenever you picked up a cup you could see the wet rim marked it left. These cups should be dry if you‚Äôre going to store them rim down. Drying them rim down traps the moisture inside (causing an unpleasant odor and taste), and damages the shelves, and is altogether unsanitary if the shelves aren‚Äôt even clean. Storing them rim side up would be a better option in this case . They are used often enough for collecting dust to be an argument for storing them rim side down. Sanitary conditions aside, for a vegan/vegetarian place for the only milk option to be whole milk was disappointing. Consider offering milk alternatives.

The food was even more disappointing . My guest ate his omelet , but I good not stomach my food. The cornbread French toast was incredibly dry, even soaking it in the butter and syrup didn‚Äôt revive it. The potatoes tasted fine but they were stale. Since it was the only semi edible thing available to me I picked at that instead of what I ordered. I only managed to eat half of one slice of French toast and didn‚Äôt want to take it home. We came out of our way to go here after seeing it on Instagram. So it was that much more disappointing.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dmN2VXRRRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gaia+House+Cafe/@42.956291,-85.9307035,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8819ad136992bf85:0x4337bf28a6cc5795!8m2!3d42.9907397!4d-85.6631991!16s%2Fg%2F11qrvs42ls?hl=en",ChIJhb-SaROtGYgRlVfMpii_N0M,Vegetarian restaurant,1.0,Gaia House Cafe,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGTV89EXPmi4xegegpQeq0ZqARuIAlRjID0pB7=w150-h150-k-no-p,restaurant

"Enjoyed a nice breakfast today at Gaia. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. Our party of six was seated immediate on a Saturday morning.

Unpretentious, casual, warm interior. Small menu, but nice to have so many vegetarian and vegan options. Good to have the opportunity to try something different, outside the normal brunch fare.

I stuck with what I normally like - eggs & potatoes plus tried a fruit cup. It was a filling portion and cooked well. The potatoes were well seasoned and crispy. I also enjoyed the sourdough bread that came with my meal. The fruit was fresh and seasonal. Coffee was self-service and offered three options, with creamer available at request. I tried the Swiss chocolate brew and liked it a lot. My friend‚Äôs specialty French toasted looked amazing. It has tender sweet saut√©ed apples, cherry sauce, and almonds. Everyone had to try an apple slice - they were really good!

"I loved this re-discovery recently! I vowed that if I ever noticed that Gaia Cafe was back  in any way I would maintain patronage as I used to frequent the Cafe when I was a student at Aquinas with friends and family as I maintained a vegetarian diet the majority of my time in attendance there. Thank you for coming back, I love the changes and the maintenance of staple favorites like B.Y.O.B. and Mean Green Burrito. I personally chose the Veggie Stash as recommended by my wonderful hostess (I selected the vegan options for cream cheese and cheese toppings as in recent years I have had to cut dairy out of my diet more fully). I had a lovely experience with the self service water and coffee, enjoying the flow of the community coming in and out of the Cafe as I spent a few hours there working on a few personal and professional goals and trying a new, but also nostalgic, meal.

"First timer- after waiting so long to try- and I loved so much! I wanted to try the stuffed tortilla but weirdly the price on the online menu is $4 cheaper than when you go to actually order it online- a lot of menu items were the same way and I wonder if it's on purpose or if the online menu just needs to be updated? Instead, I got the mean green burrito and I loved how fresh it was- I love love love greens and veggies in a burrito and the tomatillo on top was superb. Howeverrr I really really wished the rice and beans had some more flavor! The whole concept of this burrito is amazing but I was left wanting more when the bulk of the burrito was kind of bland.

"Cute aquarium. I‚Äôll lay out the pros and cons to help anyone visiting Boston for a few days decide whether coming here is worth it or not.

Cons:
I wasn‚Äôt a fan of layout of the building itself and the flow between exhibits was kind of awkward. Also, the touch tanks (ie where the sharks and rays are) are right at the entrance and easy to pass by when you enter. If you go into the gift shop before seeing that area you won‚Äôt be able to come back in without showing your ticket again which is kind of annoying.

The ticket price was also kind of expensive for the size of the aquarium ($34) considering there isn‚Äôt that much to see and you‚Äôll probably spend 1.5-2h there at most. The gift shop has only a few items with the cute logo on it and the rest have tacky clip art on them that you wouldn‚Äôt even be able to tell came from this specific aquarium. They should at least put Boston on there or something.

Pros:
Some of the habitats are so creatively curated, from the shape of the glass to the way they planted the vegetation, it‚Äôs all very pleasing to the eye. If you go in the morning you can see the animals being fed which is extra entertaining. They all seem happy especially the turtles who you can see love to be handled by the marine biologists. All staff is friendly and open to answering questions. If you have small kids and came with a stroller they have elevators and a ramp that goes all the way around the building so you can walk around easily without missing anything.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OXNTRU9REAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/New+England+Aquarium/@43.8628939,-75.5957617,6z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e3707d60bfd085:0xdda63d8ad6157d49!8m2!3d42.3592478!4d-71.0491475!16zL20vMDUyamZo?hl=en",ChIJhdC_YH1w44kRSX0V1oo9pt0,Aquarium,4.0,New England Aquarium,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1ShvWh47P907k6zdCq-NCKXNbH7h7UQkQzseo=w150-h150-k-no-p,activity

"4/5 stars because I wasn't super impressed with the overall offerings of live species.
I do love the design of the aquarium and the overall feel when you walk in to the penguin exhibit.

I've been to some great aquariums and I missed the sharks and the sea otters and in Oregon they even had an orca-which happened to be in the movie, Free Willy. Although that was years ago they still have a fantastic exhibit with many more species.

I don't want to be too harsh of a critic, but I was a bit underwhelmed.

I did enjoy the penguin exhibit, the seals and the big sea turtles.

The feel tank had stingrays alone. It was fine, but many feel tanks usually have starfish and other sea urchins. As well as someone commentating.

It was pretty busy and hard to get good pictures, since everybody else is trying to do the same thing.

"We were driving from Portland home to Canada and it was getting quite late so we found the little town of Shelton and it seemed like a convenient place to stop, being only an hour and a half from the Port Angeles Ferry. We googled a place to stay in Shelton and there was a very limited selection so we pulled into a couple and looked for reviews. Let‚Äôs just say they sounded like rat motels from what we read from other travellers. Once we saw there was a Super 8 in Shelton it seemed like the natural place to say as they are typically a decent place to stay being a franchise and all.

We checked in around 8pm and the front desk person was friendly although seemingly bored with his job. The lobby was clean and nice. We had a truck full of purchases that we didn‚Äôt want to leave outside overnight so it was nice that there was an emergency door close to where we parked for bringing all our stuff in. The front desk person did state that the hotel was located in a decent part of town and our stuff would probably be fine.

We paid $70 for the night which was high considering it was a fairly old hotel. It appeared to have been renovated at one point but the work was amateur at best. There were simple things like repairs to the towel bar which were just never painted over. Little touches like that go unnoticed when done but become BIG eyesores when left not finished. The temperature in the room was hard to keep consistent. I had to keep turning on and off the heat because the room likely is not well insulated. The bath towels were small and the caulking around the tub was gross. There was a mini fridge and coffee area, which was a nice touch. We could hear the voices from the other rooms and the aroma of the Mary J was thick in the hallways. We did not stay for the breakfast unfortunately as we were up and out to head for the ferry.

We didn‚Äôt use any of the amenities, we literally just used this hotel to sleep as a crash pad and it did its job. We felt it was pretty clean and mostly quiet and if we had to stay in Shelton again this would definitely be our first stop.

I Love the Zoo and the Staff are Very Friendly. Animals enclosures are kinda small but they working hard to renovate and expand many of the habitats and you can tell that the Staff cares for the animals.

The zoo train does NOT take you through the zoo so be aware of that prior to ticket purchase. Also the train seating is very cramped. Otherwise a fun place.

I want to say the bar needs an additional person but with so few tables two should suffice. It is a shame they dont knock the wall down and expand the kitchen and dining room.

The pool was nice, my son loved it. There was a problem with our refrigerator as it wouldn't stay colder than 40 degrees so we had to throw out our sandwiches.  The hotel comped one breakfast for us each so that was very nice.  Later I figured out that if you put ice in the ice bag and tie it, then place it into a laundry bag and place that inside the refrigerator- plus keep the cabinet door open to let heat escape- it kept the refrigerator at 35. We would put our leftovers ontop of the ice and it worked. Maybe if they take the cabinet door off that should allow the refrigerator sensor to adequately adjust ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

"My son took me on a trip to Savannah for my birthday. I can't begin to even explain how impressed I was with Hyatt Regency Savannah. When you pull up...valet and busboy. Check-in was seamless.

We had it to ourselves for nearly two hours. The room was immaculate! I e worked in the hotel industry...the housekeepers there don't skip any steps. I appreciate that. Within walking distance (some right across the street) were souvenir shops, breweries, pubs, restaurants... everything you need! Our view was a gorgeous clock tower on city hall.

"Thin Walls - We paid a decent price for our room on the top floor with Riverview. Not only did we hear the couple from next door enjoying themselves, but we felt the all the ""rocking"" in our bed as their movements transferred to us through the wall. The shared door probably didn't help the noise, but I've never felt bed movements through a wall before.

It was pretty disgusting. I called to request a transfer and was put on hold for ~10 minutes until the call dropped. I called again and was told that every room was taken. They offered for security to come and knock on their door but I declined. All things considered, our neighbors weren't being terribly loud or obnoxious. We just heard (and felt) all the ""commotion"". I don't necessarily blame our neighbors for cheap walls. Plus, a visit from security might encourage more noise/motion as retaliation.

We also had dinner at the restaurant and that was incredible. They have this seafood dish with a tomato broth that was divine. Everyone in our party raved about thier food.
Breakfast, we would advise to skip the buffet, it was not up to the rest of the standards. Pastries were days old, the hot fares were mediocre.  The fruit was nice but that was not worth the price. So I would suggest breakfast offsite and there close places to choose from.

"This was our first weekend away from our 5 children in over 2 years and the Eden Resort and Suites did not disappoint. From the welcoming atmosphere, cleanliness, and phenomenal staff we will definitely make this our first choice for another staycation. The staff was accommodating and courteous.  While walking down the hall to my brother and sister-in-law's room carrying her birthday gifts a staff member in front of us turned around and asked if we needed assistance carrying anything.  The room was spacious and comfortable and we loved the adults-only floor. We all actually decided to not go out and do an activity but stayed in the room and had beverages and played cards till after 2 AM. A big plus is where our room was and the ""J"" entrance we were a mere 100 steps to the Sheetz :) The only complaint we have is with the pool. We have no problem and understand the booking of time slots to ensure everyone's safety I wish it was open later for adults. Most places we have visited only allow adults after 10 PM.  It was kind of hard to enjoy the hot tub. Otherwise, I really have no complaints at all.

"We stayed here over the Thanksgiving weekend to visit family.  We had a room right off the pool so our grandchildren could come visit and spend time swimming. It has a tropical atmosphere and a hot tub. The door to the pool is locked from the outside at night and there is an alarm that alerts you if someone opens the door from the room. This is great for safety for families with small children. The room we had was spacious with 2 queen beds. The room was clean.  I liked the vanity make up area outside the bathroom but the lighting should be more conducive to being able to see better. This hotel has a bar off the dining room and the dining room had certain hours of operation...which is ok as I like the option to eat in the dining room instead of going out.There was a convenience store which carried lots of goodies including great coffee from Lancaster County. I really like the classic charm throughout this whole resort and the  service of the staff was
superior throughout.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is the comfort of the bed. We woke up each morning with backaches. Maybe mattresses should be upgraded ü§î.

The pool was heated, but it was still cold in my opinion. They ran out of towels when I had arrived to the pool so I had to wait until I was ready to leave and they had just restocked the towels. The playground was small, but nice. The basketball court was also nice. The table tennis could have been maintained better, the net was broken so was the 1 paddle that was at the table. While I was there the restaurant was closed for renovations.

"We came to Lancaster to enjoy the New Year. We stayed in the King Villas. The room itself was beautiful. The bathroom could have used some updating. Also the  kitchenware needed better cleaning, but nice nonetheless. The real issue with my stay and why I would never decide to visit again was the customer service and my personal property. I stayed overnight on New Year‚Äôs Eve. I woke up in the morning to find my white car parked in the lot COVERED with confetti. My car was the only one within that lot covered. I was understandably upset, and wanted to rectify the situation. I called the front desk and explained the issue. I understand it was not the hotel, but rather other guests and my personal property is not the responsibility of the resort. Where is the accountability for the guests they house? They offered minimal help or care. The most they could offer to assist was windex and paper towels or filing a police report. They had no usable hose on the property where I could have rinsed off my car. They offered no kind of compensation towards a car wash, even $5.00 would have gone a long way. The confetti had to later be POWER-WASHED from my car.

"I went to an event that offering a free meal by a mattress salesman.
I personally wanted one of the lobster dinners they were advertising so I ordered it after the event was over.
It looked like the lobsters were old, sat out all day then microwaved. A $50/$60 tasteless plate. I sent it back and kept the free meal. That free meal was also tasteless. No seasoning on Anything.
That was an event offered there for several days.
That salesman had to have spent thousands!
My suggestion to him, find another restaurant if he ever came back to Pittsburgh. The best thing offered at Red Lobster that day was the bed because I bought one!!

Everything in the lobby was very clean, neat and orderly. It looked like this place had been remodeled recently.
The breakfast and sitting area are located right off of the main entrance across from the lobby.
It too was very clean and neat.
I stopped here for one night on my return trip home from Florida.
I always choose a Best Western because the rooms are very clean, they give you complimentary toiletries, blow dryer, iron and ironing board, a coffee pot and free coffee in your room. You also get a refrigerator and microwave in your room and free WiFi.
I always try to get a king size bedroom. The beds are super comfortable, and I‚Äôm able to get a good nights sleep.
With my room came with a complimentary breakfast. This is standard with most Best Westerns.
This Smithville Best Western has an indoor pool which is permanently closed and a gym. I did not use them.
For breakfast they serve scrambled eggs, ham or bacon, grits, homemade waffles, that you make yourself. Cold cereal, oatmeal, fresh fruit, yogurt, biscuits and sausage gravy, bagels, toast, muffins, pastries, coffee, tea, juices, or milk. You can have as much as you want. The breakfast is constantly replenished by a sweet older lady.
Checkin was very easy. The front desk staff was extremely nice, and made some recommendations when we asked. They have a free parking lot.

"For as much money as I paid, and how high scale they make the hotel look/seem, im very disappointed and will not be booking here again. Upon walking in and inspecting my room, there were crumbs and dirt everywhere. Nice to know they dont sweep or vacuum in between guests. I stayed two nights, and found myself having to go to the restaurants in the casino for more to drink than the two complimentary mini bottles of water they give you, and one bottle of ginger ale was 5 dollars. I guess i should‚Äôve expected nothing less, but the food and restaurants all seemed the same. The food they offer at luckies you can find at orchid kitchen which is also the envivo restaurant in one. I expected since the restaurants are listed as separate entities that they would be separate but its not. I was looking forward to staying here but I am extremely disappointed. Imagine cutting into a beautiful extravagant looking cake just to find out its made out of rice krispie treats. That‚Äôs exactly what staying here was like, i‚Äôve stayed at cleaner hotels that were cheaper than this. Even the complimentary toiletries were dirty looking.

Had the privilege to see Jill Scott here, it sounded great and visually it looked stunning.

Bathrooms, seats and bars are all brand new and staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful.

"You can consider LA CREME your go-to spot for small batch, organic artisan crepes. The Canela and Citron crepes are our favorites. Make sure to order them with strawberries.

The difference, as with most great restaurants, starts with using excellent ingredients. When we spoke to Kim, the owner of LA CREME, she explained that their toppings are either made in-house or sourced from high quality bakers and such is the whipped cream ‚Äî a delicious level of thickness with the right amount of sweet.

You can feel the attention to details in the decor. It‚Äôs down to earth with an elegant use of black and white with splashes of rose gold among the perfectly socially-distanced tables.

The staff is young, precise, and welcoming.

Overall a great experience that can rival those in Napa, where we‚Äôve been going for years.

One small change I would suggest is upgrading the coffee creamer. Pleased do away with the plastic containers.

"My wife and I stopped here for lunch following a trip to Chriskindlemart.

We were quickly greeted by the hostess and or waitress Kim came over to us to take our order relatively quickly. She greeted us with a smile in a very friendly manner.

We both ordered the strawberry lemonade which is a great thirst quencher. For appetizers,  we shared the crab dip and brown butter buffalo wings which were delicious.

For meals, my wife had the crab cakes with brussel sprouts and the bacon twice baked potato. She said the crab cakes were very good but said the brussel sprouts,  although extremely tasty and flavorful,  were not fully cooked and were somewhat hard. She also said the twice baked potato filling was very good, but the skin of the potato was very hard and overcooked.

I had the butter garlic strip steak medium well with the broccoli, potato wedges and the stuffed potato.

The steak was served already sliced, and although not a huge problem, not something that I prefer. It was slightly over cooked. To me, medium well it's slightly pink in the center (serving temp around 160*) but it was cooked well done. Also, the menu says roasted garlic and herb butter. I didn't sense any butter on it and it came with quartered garlic on top. The wedges were very tasty and seasoned nicely as was the stuffed potato.

For dessert we had the funnel cake fried Oreo's which was delicious!

The presentation of all the food was exceptional. The cleanliness of the restaurant was superb. There wasn't a time when we didn't see someone cleaning.

Lastly, the food was not very expensive for the portions.

The waitress clearly saw that I only took one small bite of my burger and never even questioned whether I liked it or not or if they could remake it. Still charged me full price & that was truly disappointing. Basic customer service adequate, would be to ask the customer if they enjoyed their food or how things were? But she clearly she did not.

"Small casino compared to other ones I‚Äôve been to (Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods). We stayed for a night in the Center Suite as a mini getaway from home.

They allowed us to check-in early, which was nice, especially since my husband wanted to take my toddler to the pool. Toddler had fun in the pool, but besides that there wasn‚Äôt much to do for the little one.
Ate dinner at one of the restaurants on the casino floor and then spent rest of the evening in the room watching tv (not much option). Ordered room service for breakfast the next day before we went home. There was nothing special about it and coffee had a horrible cleaning supply taste to it. Pretty expensive especially since 18% gratuity was included in the room service bill

"Absolutely recommend this resort! Beautiful decor and VERY friendly staff. Our room, a suite, was appropriately sized and fun to be in, also was able to check in 1.5 hours early so that was also very sweet to the price deal. The pool i recommend going early if enjoying adults only type of time, by 2-3pm lots of kiddos around. Bistecca was SUPER delicious and wait staff was very friendly and attentive. The live band playing last night 8/12 was jamming pretty well, i didnt stick around to give a full listen though. The cabanas were amazing to utilize, you also get to use the pool before/after checkout so thats a plus. Only gripes would be: unless you valet, theres no separate parking for the hotel, so you either walk thru the casino(which is probably designed on purpose) or walk around the outside, about a 5 min walk. Also, be prepared if going/leaving during peak times as your mixed in with regular casino goers so you may end up in the back of the lot. Secondly, theres not a lot of communication; in terms of staff to staff and promoting. Know before you go, the ONLY place to ACTUALLY get breakfast is Fieri's kitchen (other pption is a starbucks) unless you pay attention to the changing directory sign, you have no indication thats it for breakfast. Thirdly, the buffet opens an hour AFTER checkout, again, breakfast is the cheapest meal to execute so dropping the ball there too.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cE92Ql9nRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mount+Airy+Casino+Resort/@37.5346621,-86.6444706,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x89c48d2f05e529b1:0x7f37e8a22bad11cb!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d41.113512!4d-75.321688!16s%2Fm%2F05215w6?hl=en",ChIJsSnlBS-NxIkRyxGtK6LoN38,Casino,4.0,Mount Airy Casino Resort,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIhaPOVH5-c94OAgasZ0aoXCVQj1GlbsLpwGeB=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"After a few years of renting boats from a local competitor that always had issues (non existent bimini, broken gas gauge, engine that was leaking gas, dirty and old boats, etc), i decided to try a new rental place.

I rented the 18 foot 150hp Bowrider.  There were no massive issues like before.  The boat was clean, fast, and fun.  The stereo didn't work but we had a wireless water proof speaker for this anyways.  We rented for 3 days and came back once for a fuel up in between.

The only downside was that we hit an underwater log in the middle of the lake.  They showed me the damage to the skeg and as I had taken a pic of the prop/skeg before the rental, it was undeniable.  Got hit with a $350 charge for repair, but I can't blame Yankee as this is part of the risk of boating.

"The hotel phone and online reservation staff, parking lot, and conference staff are disconnected and disjointed.

I WOULD NOT recommend this place for a conference just based on trying to reserve a room and set up for conferences.

The front desk folks are nice and polite.

I COULD NOT stay at the hotel because they would answer the phone and transferred me to a number that would just disconnect you and emails go unanswered or vague responses with no answers to your questions.

They seem to be focused on valet services and conference fees but making vendors at conferences jump through hoops. You must leave keys with the valet to unload and you can't use the side doors because it bypasses the valet.

They respond with the ability to ignore your issues with short useless comments.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eVp2QW1nRRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Perdido+Beach+Resort/@31.9788356,-97.5429081,6z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x889a070af414aab9:0x44d9126e8d835330!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d30.273649!4d-87.561467!16s%2Fg%2F1tj2p783?hl=en",ChIJuaoU9AoHmogRMFODjW4S2UQ,Hotel,1.0,Perdido Beach Resort,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXthKEyzLeE4n2HdbGNgZsJZuipPkZfJiJvb8d=w150-h150-k-no-p,hotel

"Very economical. This sampler I got had 4 different things on it using a big plate. For $3 more, you get a salad and drink. All said and done, about $12 for everything, and it was a ton of food. Service was great. Food was prepared quickly, very friendly people, and attentive to check up on you. Bread sticks (when dining in) are unlimited, and they come hot and fresh, buttered and seasoned with garlic. They are super soft and fluffy. Honestly, I rate their breadsticks above Olive Gardens. They are wonderful. Reasons why I‚Äôm not going with 5 stars, is nothing that this location has control over. It‚Äôs not a complaint of the individual location itself. First issue is, I felt the Alfredo sauce was very bland. I‚Äôve had stuff out of a jar at home that beats it. Secondly, the amount of sauce (all 3 pastas had the same issue) they put on is very little compared to the noodles you get. My feeling is, I can buy a pound of uncooked noodles for $1 at the store. After they absorb the water, you‚Äôve got 2lbs of noodles for $1. Commercially, they buy them much cheaper than that even. Noodles are incredibly cheap. Yet, you‚Äôre not really given enough sauce for them. Since pasta is so cheap, you‚Äôd think they could afford another 50 cents of sauce. The picture makes it look ok because it‚Äôs all on the top. It certainly looks like a decent amount of sauce. But you can‚Äôt see the noodle to sauce ratio. Also, I assume they have a pre-specified ladle size they are told to use. However, mix things up (or eat the top portion), and you‚Äôll quickly find yourself eating plain noodles. Again, I‚Äôm sure this is a corporate thing, and not location specific, but you‚Äôre reading my review because you want an honest review, right? So, I‚Äôm going to tell my experience as it was. Over all, I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars still, as service is good, breadsticks are wonderful, and food was pretty good, aside from the lack of sauce. Go in there prepared with this info, and see what you think. And remember, those wonderful breadsticks... they are unlimited. They will keep bringing more if you want.

"I've eaten there, and now I work there. So I get to see the food ""behind the scenes"". Most, if not all, is homemade in the sense that whoever the cook is, they will cook it their own way with their own ingredients like they would in their own home. So you get to try the same food about 4 to 5 different ways which I think is pretty awesome. The cooks take allergy warnings very seriously. The owners come in pretty much every day to make sure we dont stray off of the path that they made to build this restaurant and its food upon. We have SO many return customers that when they're off work they will hang out with us from open to close. We strive to be extra friendly and helpful! And our MANY return customers can verify.  We have 2 flat screens to watch your sports on or for your child to watch cartoons so you can eat with some peace (lol). Our food is great tasting. Certain waitresses will buy 4 to 5 bowls of homemade cream of crab soup to take home for the night. As an example. So if we trust the food enough to eat it AND buy it in bulk, I'm sure you will love your dinner! Since I started working 1 month ago, I have yet to hear not even one complaint. If I work somewhere that's not all that good, I'm not afraid to say so. So I promise I'm not on here because anyone told me to, or to try to gain more customers etc. I simply rated it because my phone noticed how often I come here and asked me to review it LOL. Dont be afraid to give it a try. The portions range from ""good size for the money"" to ""Massive""! We are located inside the Laurel De Truck Stop/gas station with the Hardees hooked to it.

"Pretty decent little sandwich shop. They have hoagies, cheesesteaks, burgers, wings, and almost any other American type food. Tonight, I saw they had a great deal on Uber Eats offering buy 1 get one 1 free on select items. I decided to try the classic Philly cheesesteak, which also came with their hand cut fries (you also have the option of substituting chicken for steak).

The cheesesteak was about $12.50 each, which I think is an okay price. Portion size is decent too, not too big nor too small. I will say that there was quite a lot of bread in comparison to the meat, cheese, and vegetables. I believe the bun was too thick. The steak itself was pretty flavorful and had a good texture. They use an adequate amount of cheese. Good amount of mushrooms, and each mushroom is quite big, but they do have a slight canned flavor.

The fries were just okay. Quality probably declined due to them being in the car for delivery. Still, they were not bad, and definitely nice to get fries for free. As usual, I would have wanted a bit more salt or pepper, and they were a bit limp.

All in all, not a bad spot for a sandwich, wings, or other classic American fare. The cheesesteak was still enjoyable, just nothing special.

"Great little zoo with well kept animals. The zoo is really well kept and they have a really good variety of animals. Their cages were clean and they all seemed happy and well-fed. The whole zoo isn't very big but definitely worth the price. The customer service is what needs a little work. Some of the employees were great and very friendly while others seemed to be bothered by questions. I also didn't like that there was only one very small restroom in the very beginning.
