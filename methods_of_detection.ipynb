The trampolines are ample so there is loads of time to enjoy without waiting. And you get to control the time yourself. Overall a great place to get some active jumping in. \n",

We just visited two days ago and they were having some kind of funeral, I really don't get how that would stop anyone from using the place... seems a weird day to block rooms altogether. My kids are older now so they don't care about the trampolines, climbing equipment or giant slide... THE ARCADE IS GONE! All the pinball, Ms. Pac Man and pool tables are gone! I'm disappointed about this because those are the groups I liked hanging around with.  The laser tag was reset and was fun but the kids prefer the big arcade, who didn't?\n",

      "Spell check:  Great food with friendly staff! We had the bruschetta caprese starter to share. It came with two very large pieces of bruschetta and a spoonful of caprese salad. I could have made a meal of just this dish! The toasted sourdough bread in particular was outstanding. My friend had a wrap from their lunch menu and raved about it. I decided on the gnocchi for my main. This was wonderful gnocchi with three kinds of mushrooms and sautéed spinach on top. While the portion size was fine, due to the dish being almost entirely gnocchi, I could have used more vegetables to offset the gnocchi. The sauce was quite good! The server’s service was quick and friendly. We came in 10 mins before their food rush, so they were a little slower bringing out our food as they were preparing to shut down their lunch service. I would gladly come back and try the restaurant\n",
      "Spell check:  Currently my favorite place to have food in Moorhead. Not only do they have delicious gluten free pasta dishes, their Salivar Red Sauce is AMAZING. \n",
      "Spell check:  The best Place to relax and lovely aqua park with cool water that make you so happy ! \n",
      "Spell check:  Concord have been to it once before and I have to say that it is rich in history. It is now fixed with a Great staff and terrific dining experience especially in the lounge area. Warm with clean and rich in atmosphere. \n",
      "Spell check:  Great place! The pool area was amazing and the decor in the indoor pool in vintage with enough modern twists to make it nice and clean. The staff was so friendly and blended with the guests for a great experience. \n",
      "Spell check:  I hadn't visited this casino for about 8 years! I was in for the night and decided to try their buffet. I could confidently say that it's the best buffet some I ever experienced from a casino venue. Everything from Russian food mackerel to the traditional American lays they covered it. Lots of salads and fruits, and it wasn't a wasted buffet that you always have to question who the hell ate the scalloped potatoes. EVERYTHING looks like it just came out of the oven! I hope they don't close down, employee or not I will be back in the summer season to enjoy a buffet until they close! \n",
      "Spell check:  Poor room service \n",
      "Spell check:  Room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. Their indoor pool and hot tub were a lot of fun, but if you're like me, you'll need to wear a swim cap because their cap worn pool is basically a giant pound, not a soothing \"spa pool\". The casino has a nice variety of slot machines and table games. \n",
      "Spell check:  So beautiful from the stroll outside// to our room the view was so breath taking.. the food in the restaurant was good.. old style cooking for the southern country.. and lovely ambiance!! Thank you so much☺️ \n",
      "Spell check:  Very nice and clean place. People are extremely polite and very helpful. \n",
      "Spell check:  Enjoy staying here... The room, the bed, everything was very clean and the staff was professional, polite and friendly. I do recommend!! \n",
      "Spell check:  Good place for all type of re- wood professional and family trip. \n",
      "Spell check:  This has to be one of the most perfect hotels I’ve ever been too, a Welcome of hospitality, a array of the rooms to choose from, no matter what the purpose is they have a perfect room for you to choose from, if you’re stop by just to rest over night to weeks at a time to a family trip with kids / grandkids, whatever it is their rooms are excellent in staff recommendation / good maintenance work is totally seen to keep it neat / clean for all times of ones stay. EXCELLENT SERVICE HATS OFF \n",
      "Spell check:  Camzon's is one of the best Mexican experiences I have ever had in my life! My wife isn't into Mexican that much but after this visit she was truly blown away by Camzons as was I many times over, hehe. I thought these pictures would help tell all the other customers anticipating this visit, that we didn't get when eating there...\n",
      "I ate the Denver omelet and it costed $13 and it was really really good. I have probably never had one better and to have such affordable prices mark this review at 5 stars all the way. I'd say that this review deserves ten stars plus and I am sure most other customers would agree with me on that. It's not a far drive here at all and was close by for me as I live in a neighboring community but I am so happy I found this place and look forward to my next visit with less interuption, such as during the breakkast hour, hehe.\n",
      "Delish\n",
      "Spell check:  Can't go wrong with the big burrito, it is delicious!! The place could be cleaner in some ways,but the food is great, it's one of the few places that you can still get a black raspberry or lime margarita (pink or lime) it's so refreshing on a hot sunny day, ohh the queso is great too \n",
      "Spell check:  Very good tamales would recommend the Chile Colorado, experience tamales you never had. Dominican restaurant but super tasty definitely bring cash it, has no card option. \n",
      "Spell check:  The food and service was good, my only complaint is that their are no tacos on the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise the El Matador was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone \n",
      "Spell check:  Authentic Mexican food, reasonably priced, and fantastic service!  Got the chicken fajita burrito and it was filling alone and well worth the price!  One of my local Mexican restaurants and won’t be switching anytime soon! \n",
      "Spell check:  Rolled tortas and chicken nachos. \n",
      "Spell check:  It is a bit tight inside and the service was just ok, but the food was excellent. My wife had enchiladas, I got the seafood fajitas and we both had the meal with a house salad and house rice and beans.\n",
      "It took an almost hour to get our meal, so I was worried she wasn't going to get hers before she had to leave. Which would have been unfortunate since the fire alarm was going off and nobody at the restaurant seemed to care.\n",
      "The fajitas were pretty big, hers were with 3 chicken and 3 shrimp. Mine was plump mussels and scallops, some of the mussels were a bit rubbery, but otherwise good. The satay sauce was good for the chicken, but I think it would have been better with a different ranchero sauce for the seafood fajitas and I had to go out of the way to get some container and hot sauce from the other table since nobody seemed to care.\n",
      "Spell check:  I'm going to try my best to be fair here because other cruisers really seem to dig this little taco shack known as La Cancun #2. I did not. A man will review a lady. This isn't mexican cuisine. It's barbque and sloppy tacos for a quick truck stop taco shack. Mr. Kristofer started us off with a lime margarita. C- In a random town? I would think it'd at least taste like tequila. They had real lime wedge that was nice of them. Your seafood tower? Whole Red Lobster, please. That should be a standard. Now, keep talking. It's a $14.00 seafood tower. And this has to be from the far end of the seafood tower good-ness wagon. A $14.00 shrimp. This isn't even fully two bites. Two bites! Not a meal for a grow adult. $14.99 for a second meal for my twins. Mr.\n",
      "Spell check:  The food was good and the staff is wonderful. I love taking my kids there because the staff is attentive and so friendly. \n",
      "Spell check:  Great food and the best margaritas \n",
      "Spell check:  Very nice atmosphere and the food is delicious! My kids always get chicken tenders and they give great portion sizes! Has a full bar area, off dining area in and out of restaurant. I don't even like seafood but I very much enjoyed the ceviche it was a bit spicy but good! I would recommend this restaurant 🙂 \n",
      "Spell check:  Great service,extremely clean n nice atmosphere! Slightly pricey, but overall very satisfied with my experience! \n",
      "Spell check:  AMAZING food, Great service and ambiance! \n",
      "Spell check:  This place is owned and operated by wonderful people\n",
      "and their delicious food live u to the hype.\n",
      "Get the Teddy Bear Stew, it is one of Lexingtons best kept secrets \n",
      "Spell check:  The food is fantastic and you're given so much for a reasonable price. The portions were huge, we got two platters to split and had a ton of leftovers. I would definitely recommend for anyone who wants another place to try Ethiopian! \n",
      "Spell check:  Fantastic food! \n",
      "Spell check:  Absolutely delicious!  In fact I didn’t stop eating and ate it all. \n",
      "Spell check:  Got the stews without lamb, both were amazing.  I accidentally said it came with melon, but they didn't include any.  The only complaint is that an order of spicy extra spicy was only slightly spicy by American standards.  I wasn't expecting it to blow my focus goggles off.  It was more subtle than bold flavor. \n",
      "Spell check:  I've eaten here twice now, the first time was good, the second time was very good. I'm not a huge Ethiopian food expert, I tried my usual mix of yellow for hands, carrots and spinach with a side of beef more for texture and as an order of injera to eat with my main. The sour and spicy sauces are fantastic as every meal I've had in every continent of the world at places that offer them has been great. \n",
      "Spell check:  This place maybe the best restaurant I've ever been to.....I went here last night, it was just my wife and I....we usually get sampler's or vegetarian platters with the beef...... those are the only things we ate here EVERYTHING else was made from scratch in the back.....buying their bread chicken eggs sugar exotic fruit spices.......eat here if your reading this.....this place is amazing \n",
      "Spell check:  Absolutely delicious! Food was fresh, tasty, and filling. Service was friendly and attentive. I would definitely come here again! \n",
      "Spell check:  They have old fashion pool and fun for even 50 years old adults \n",
      "Spell check:  Best ever and one of the first places I eat at when I return to the states and is home \n",
      "Spell check:  Best of Best \n",
      "Spell check:  The best in Indy, hands down! Owner is always there and welcomes guests. Food is always hot and perfect with service. Fair amount of seating available and the most friendly staff. \n",
      "Spell check:  Wow, the food here is amazing! We had never tried this place, but were lucky that we made it in on a night when even the restaurant was super busy, but did not end up waiting for a table for very long among the 25 or so other people in the front area.\n",
      "This is the lamb tibs (real lamb meat) and I've added a couple of chicken dishes to share as well. We might try some of the vegetarian teff sometime, but these meats were so good and flavorful. And the portion sizes are huge. The chicken was amazing and the grape leaves are so tasty and have lots of lemon, which I love.\n",
      "Seriously, try this place out, you'll be glad you did \n",
      "Spell check:  I truly enjoyed the hospitality! \n",
      "Spell check:  Had an awesome stay! Loved Jane, the room and the whole place was stunning inside and outside! \n",
      "Spell check:  Enthralling in 2018, the Peacock Inn is our frequent \"must stop\" in downtown Camden, MI. Alison is a fabulous lady who loves people and wants you to have a great time. Wonderful breakfast choices and well appointed rooms makes you feel like your in a different era. Expanded parking area in 2018 as well! They are also part of the Wildwood chain about a mile down 29th street. \n",
      "Spell check:  We loved the carriage house. Great location and the breakfast was outstanding!! Very accessible for our family. Property was so beautiful. We will be back!! \n",
      "Spell check:  Great place to stay. The cabin is new, and was very clean. The fireplace was fantastic for the cold winter evenings. The rooms are spacious, and the amenities are  adequate, minus a cup of coffee. Good breakfast was provided. The host Heather was great and provided great recommendations! We hope to have an opportunity to return to the  rustic comfort of Serenity Way! \n",
      "Spell check:  What a great location and view of one of most beautiful bodies of water on the planet! A house built to resemble ships mid sea. The owners could not have been more knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and welcoming! There home and deck would inspire anyone to create beauty in life. \n",
      "Spell check:  Comfy beds! Great little breakfast, and the lady who took care of us was so helpful and friendly, and let us use the laundry. Great location, too, right downtown and LITERALLY a 30 second walk to the delicious \"Chicken Shack\" restaurant. Highly recommended!! \n",
      "Spell check:  Beautiful property, rooms in the \"bungalow\" are very nice with one 1 queen and two twins in a bedroom with a full kitchen. Bathroom is attached to bedroom, with a tub and shower. Outhouse is located directly across from building. Fire pit is located across from buildings in field. Lot’s of windows to look out and see the beautiful landscape. Breakfast in a basket is served on a dark, green tray: Biscuits, sausage, fruit, and a muffin. Very good food, however, I wish the couple would use some other type of plate other than the tray for serving their dish. The plate causes the nicer looking tupperware to get messed up through the week. I would consider staying here again. \n",
      "Spell check:  The BEST!! \n",
      "Spell check:  Nice hidden gem in Reno with friendly staff and great food!\n",
