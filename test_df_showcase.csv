0,0,488,Arabia Steamboat Museum,Museum,"We stumbled upon this awesome museum while traveling cross country for a move. You buy the tickets in the gift shop and go below for the museum itself. Tickets are a little pricey for adults. Not all of the audio video was working and it could be a touch more accessible for kids, but we learned a lot about the time period (1850s) by walking through the exhibit. My kids were fascinated by all the artifacts."," My family had a great time at the Trap House.  We learned a lot, and had fun competing in contests that we saw played out in movies on a huge projection screen.  I recommend this place for any family that wants an entertaining afternoon. ","I recently visited this museum and I must say, it was an amazing experience. The exhibits are beautifully curated and the information provided is both informative and engaging. I especially enjoyed the hands-on activities and interactive displays, which made learning about history and culture fun and exciting.

The layout of the museum is spacious and easy to navigate. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable, always eager to answer questions and provide additional information. The museum also offers a variety of programs and events, which enhances the overall experience for visitors.

2,2,52,Frank's of Parkville,Italian restaurant,I stopped in for lunch a little bit of a late lunch. I found the lunch menu  And was surprised to see it was so reasonable. I decided on a grilled chicken Caesar salad for $6.99 what a bargain! The lettuce was fresh and ice cold just the way I like it!

I would recommend this place to anyone.," Delicious food, good service, and a relaxing atmosphere. ","I had an absolutely delicious experience at this Italian restaurant!

3,3,100,Electric Playhouse,Amusement center,"I had my son's birthday party here & the staff went above and beyond! Sonia, Scott and John were absolutely amazing - from Sonia helping to plan the event from beginning to end, Scott being one of the best server/host and John overlooking the entire production to ensure everything went perfect! The games and food are excellent as well!", Fun place but they need to put up signage so the patrons don’t get confused with where to go and it’d help a lot. ,"I recently visited the Amusement Center and had such a fantastic time that I just had to leave a glowing review! Firstly, the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming - they made sure we knew where everything was and were ready to answer any questions we had. 

The range of activities available at the center is incredible. From classic arcade games to modern virtual reality experiences, there is something for everyone. I particularly enjoyed the laser tag - it was a great way to blow off steam and have some friendly competition! 

The facilities were clean and well-maintained - always a plus in my book. And the prices were very reasonable considering the vast array of games and attractions on offer. Overall, I can’t recommend the Amusement Center enough. It’s the perfect place to have a fun day out with friends or family!"
4,4,408,Breakout KC Escape Room | River Market,Escape room center,"This was a great experience! We did the Sporting KC room with 5 adults plus a 5-year old and loved it! No spoilers, so all I'll say is don't let the small room deceive you. Plenty of clever things to discover.

They will give as many hints as you would like. Only the first requested 3 hints are free though. Anything beyond those 3 result in a 3-minute penalty each. You still get a full hour to break out, no matter how many hints you use. You're time will just look longer than one hour. This is how people get scores of 64 minutes, even though you only have an hour max.

The do give free hints if they see that you're stuck. These do not count against your 3 free requested hints, nor do they penalize your time.

My advice for the uninitiated is to not be afraid to use the hints! Especially if you're not going to try again at a later date. Enjoy the puzzles, but don't let them frustrate you. Make sure someone is keeping track of time so that you can pace the free hints.

The parking was a bit confusing. The building is close to some apartments and there's a few signs that explicitly say ""no parking"" for break out KC. Parking directly in front of the entrance says ""for tenants and patrons only"", which we had no idea what that meant. We ended up parallel parking in the street, just to be safe."," Very good experience for my first escape room experience! I went with a group of 12 total, and it was a great experience for all of us to work together. The food was delicious and the servers were very attentive. I would definitely recommend going here! ","I recently visited this escape room center and had an absolute blast! The facility was clean, well-maintained and had a variety of engaging escape rooms to choose from. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and ensured that we had a great experience. The puzzles were challenging yet solvable, which made it all the more exciting. The decor and themes of the rooms were also on point, creating a truly immersive experience. Even better, the pricing was quite reasonable for the quality of fun that we had. Overall, if you're looking for a fun and engaging activity for a group of friends or family, this escape room center is definitely worth a visit!"
5,5,28,Vallarta's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican restaurant,"Have been here multiple times with average experiences, this last time, however, sealed the deal for me. Ordered a lunch special and got 1, ONE! tamale (or enchilada, whatever). One? Really? We ordered take out so I called back & was told, 'yep, you get one!' But that's not what the menu said; silly me.", Nice Freshet to Mexican food ,"I recently visited this Mexican restaurant and it was an amazing experience. The food was absolutely delicious and the staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere was perfect for a casual dinner with friends or a more romantic date.

The shrimp tacos were my personal favorite - they were perfectly seasoned and had just the right amount of kick. The guacamole was also some of the best I've had - it was fresh and tasted homemade.

The pricing was very reasonable for the quality of food and service we received. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area looking for some delicious Mexican cuisine. It will not disappoint!"
6,6,239,Wyndham Garden Cross Lanes Charleston,Hotel,"Not a great experience overall. The only redeeming factors about the hotel are the price and the friendly employees. I stayed here while doing business in the area. I figured that swimming in one of 2 pools would be a great way to relax afterwards, especially for the price. Well, it could have definitely been better.

The first thing I noticed about the hotel is the smell of marijuana in the elevator. Then, when I got up to the hotel room, I tried to get in with the key cards they gave me. It took me no less than 10 tries to successfully use this card. I swiped it almost the same way 10 times, and it magically opened on the 10th.

The room itself was somewhat chilly when I got in. I changed the temperature and it started to heat up quickly. But, there was another odd burnt smell coming from the conditioner. It was dirty, too. Breakfast was decent. Food was nothing special, but the guy serving breakfast was awesome. Very friendly, even though I just had some coffee he offered me some freshly cooked food.

The pools were nice. Not too many people at night or during the day. Expect it to be more crowded at 9 pm than at 11 am, though. There were loads of what seemed to be pool algae all around the pool (dark green in color) but the water itself was clean. Good ambiance with the rocks and faux plants. Not too cold or too warm. Decent fitness center, too. Treadmill worked fine, they had dumbbells and a few other strength training machines. Pretty basic and small.

It's a bit tough to sleep during the night. They didn't give any pillows or blankets for the 2nd room with the pull out bed. You can hear everything and I was a bit concerned about a door near my room. People walking in and out all the time and you will surely hear some of that.

All in all, if you want a cheap hotel with 2 pools, this may be the place. The location is pretty convenient and the employees were very friendly. There are some cleanliness, room entrance, and sleeping issues, though.", Good place for family for enjoyment. Service kind of slow food was all right. ,"I recently stayed at this hotel during my business trip and I must say, it was a great experience. The staff was very friendly and always ready to help with anything we needed. The rooms were spacious, clean, and very comfortable. The hotel location is very convenient, with easy access to transportation and nearby restaurants.

The complimentary breakfast was amazing, with a wide variety of dishes to choose from. The hotel facilities were also great, with a gym that had all the necessary equipment for a good workout and a swimming pool with sparkling clean water.

Overall, I had a great stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The staff went above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable, and I will definitely stay here again!"
7,7,567,J. Alexander's Restaurant (Overland Park Grill),American restaurant,This restaurant gets a Macaroni and Cheese pass. If you love mac and cheese go get some here. My fiancee thought the steak was fantastic as well. We enjoyed our first time," Amazing place  with amazing food  and amazing service.  Joe was an amazing server,  he was very thoughtful,  helpful,  and friendly. ","I recently visited this fantastic American restaurant and I must say, it was a great experience! The ambiance was welcoming and the decor was a perfect fit for the cuisine they served. The staff were friendly and efficient, and made sure we had an excellent dining experience from start to finish.

When it comes to the food, everything was simply delicious. From the juicy burgers to the perfectly cooked steaks, the chefs definitely know their way around the kitchen. The portion sizes were generous, and the presentation was on point.

The drinks menu was no exception - the cocktails were creative and refreshing, and paired perfectly with our meals. Even the dessert selection was a treat, and left us with smiles on our faces long after we left.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this American restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal and pleasant dining experience. It's truly a must-visit, and I can't wait to go back again!"
8,8,649,First Western Inn Caseyville,Motel,"I like this place better than the Motel 6 and Quality Inn.

They have RV parking... :)", Nice place to stay.  Front desk lady was cool.  No coffee in the morning.  Not even coffee whitout asking for breakfast.  Just coffee paraphernalia. ,"I recently stayed at this motel during my road trip and my experience was quite satisfactory. The room was clean and cozy with comfortable beds, and the staff was friendly and helpful. The motel is conveniently located near the highway which made it easy to access and also close to some decent restaurants and gas stations.

The ambiance of the place really captured the essence of traditional American dining, with vintage decor and cozy seating arrangements. The menu was extensive, appealing to a wide range of tastes and dietary preferences - there was something for everyone!

I opted for their classic burger with fries and it was everything I could have asked for - juicy beef patty, crispy bacon, melted cheese, fresh veggies and a delicious bun that held everything together. The fries were perfectly crispy and seasoned just right. To top it off, the service was excellent - our server was very friendly and attentive, ensuring that we had everything we needed to make our meal enjoyable.

11,11,338,Sky Zone Trampoline Park,Amusement center,Great place for all ages !," Loads of fun, they have everything from Go-karts, bumper cars and a big arcade. It's quite big inside, they also have a little food counter and a lot of sit down seating but you don't pay for that. They also have a mini putt and a driving range but we didn't try them. ","I recently visited an Amusement center and it was an absolute blast! From the moment I walked through the doors, I could tell that this was going to be a great experience. The center is very spacious and there is plenty of room for everyone to move around and enjoy themselves without feeling cramped.

There were so many different rides and attractions to choose from, I didn't know where to begin! There were roller coasters, bumper cars, and even a virtual reality ride that made me feel like I was soaring through the skies. The arcade was also impressive with a wide variety of games to choose from, old and new.

What I appreciated most about this Amusement center was the cleanliness of the facilities. Despite the high traffic of visitors, everything was spotless and well-maintained. The staff were also attentive and helpful, making sure everybody was safe and having fun.

12,12,89,Lalibela Ethiopian Restaurant,Ethiopian restaurant,"This is one of my favorite places in New Haven. I’m an NYC expat always searching for places that remind me of my homeland. The food here is homemade, tasty and authentic. I’ve seen the reviews where people complain about the service,  and how only 1 person waits all the tables. Totally understandable if you’re in a major rush. It seems that the restaurant is family owned and operated which, to me, is a big plus. If you’re looking for fast food, this is the wrong place. If you’re looking for great food, home style vibes, great culture and a meal that will nourish your soul, come here.
By the way, don’t embarrass yourself by asking for a fork. Live a little and use your hands.", The food is delicious and the items on the menu are very affordable. ,"I recently visited an Ethiopian restaurant in my neighborhood and I must say, I was blown away! The atmosphere was warm and inviting, with traditional Ethiopian decor and music playing in the background.

The food was simply amazing! The traditional Ethiopian dishes were served on a communal platter with injera, a type of sourdough bread, as the utensil. The flavors were bold and complex, with a mix of spicy and savory elements. The vegetarian options were also fantastic, with plenty of variety.

The staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, and they made sure that we had a great experience from start to finish. The prices were reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food.

I highly recommend this Ethiopian restaurant to anyone who is looking for a unique and delicious dining experience. It's definitely worth visiting and I will definitely be coming back again and again!"

16,16,207,The Westin Hilton Head Island Resort & Spa,Hotel,"The worst hotel experience ever. Booked two nights, but could not bare it even for 24 hours, so left early.

I significantly enjoyed my stay. For Valentines Day the resort was indeed very quiet and welcoming.

The staff was very helpful and attentive. I also didn't have any service issues.

One improvement, most likely feedback for corporate, is to implement Apple Pay especially at check-in. Some credit cards offer more cash back with Apple Pay which would make a major convivence improvement."," If you do not mind the cigarette smell, non-filtered air then go right ahead.
We spend a lot of time in the room (here) and were hoping to open the window to let some unfiltered city air in..
But was unable to because a) the screen was missing so there was no way to keep bugs out and b) the window was completely rotted out so it would not close properly.
Mind you this is a non-smoking room.
(The Air filter warning sign is in the middle of the room between the front 2 beds)
The view from the window was a brick wall.
