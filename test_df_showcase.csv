213,The Westin Hilton Head Island Resort & Spa,Hotel,"We had a very relaxing visit at the Westin Hilton Head Resort. From our arrival to our departure, we found all the staff to be extremely helpful and attentive. Dino was very helpful and welcoming as well as the bar attendants on Saturday night and Sunday breakfast at the outside restaurant.  Because of the wonderfully relaxed and accommodating staff, as well as the very clean and comfortable accommodations, we extended our stay. We would definitely recommend the resort to family & friends for it’s perfect beach-front location, caring & attentive staff and the clean and comfortable accommodations."," Room stunk like old cigarettes, tub was dirty and we found dirty q-tips in the bed sheets! Don’t stay here! ","Yo, this hotel is absolutely fire! I stayed here for a weekend and it was lit. The rooms were hella comfortable and the bed was so soft, I didn't want to leave. The staff was mad cool too, super friendly and helpful. The location was clutch, right in the heart of downtown and close to all the dope spots. The only downside was the parking situation, kinda pricey. But overall, I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a lit place to stay."
377,Frankie's of Charlotte,Amusement park,Was a great experience.   It would be awesome to have package incentives to encourage more frequent visits or visits with food packages.   The outside rides are way over priced for a 3 turns around the pole.  The teacup was a one and done.   Not worth it., We took our staff bowling here and had a blast!! We rented out one of the portions of the bowling alley. It was nice that they had a full time bartender. Staff was friendly and efficient. Highly recommend doing this for a group outing. ,"OMG! This amusement park is the best place ever! I had so much fun riding all the crazy roller coasters and thrilling rides. The staff was super friendly and helpful too. It was also a great place for families, with lots of fun activities for kids. Overall, I highly recommend this amusement park - it will definitely be the highlight of your summer!"
526,Hinkle Fun Center,Amusement center,Great miniature golf course that's very scenic to look at as well as great indoor games!, Super fun for the family. Laser tag has been the most popular for us. ,"Yo guys! If you're looking for a super fun time, I totally recommend checking out this Amusement center! There's so much to do here, you could easily spend an entire day (or more) just hanging out and having a blast.

The arcade games are legit - I found myself addicted to the prize claw machine and the racing games. The staff was super friendly, and even gave me some tips on how to win big. Plus, the laser tag was SO much fun. I went with a group of friends and we had a blast running around and trying to shoot each other with the laser guns.

Overall, I had SUCH a great time here. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and exciting activity to do with friends or family. Can't wait to come back and do it all again!"
196,PUMP Restaurant Lounge,New American restaurant,Kyle best bartender and cute too ! Thanks for the awesome drinks.," It's not easy to get reservations here, but if you can get them it is absolutely worth it! We had a group of 9 and on top of getting seated right
It's not easy to get reservations here, but if you can get them here it absolutely worth it! We had a group of 9 and on top of getting seated right away the service was amazing and the food was delicious! I would recommend getting the cheddar biscuit and the 9 layer salad with grilled chicken! It's a little pricey, but well worth the price! Do some reservation hacking to get good deals! ","Yo, I gotta say this New American restaurant is lit! The vibe is dope and the food is straight up fire. I went with my squad and we tried a bunch of stuff, but the burger was next level. Like, it was juicy and the bun was toasted just right. The cocktails were a bit pricey, but they were strong and hella good. The service was chill and our server knew the menu super well. Definitely coming back soon for some more of that insane grub."
298,Hilton Sandestin Beach Golf Resort & Spa,Resort hotel,"We are currently holding ""duel hotel citizenship "" between here and the neighboring Luau Condos next door. My in-laws and children are staying here so husband and I are back and forth.  We love the Sandestin Hilton for all the convenience of the restaurants and beach access.  You must have a wrist band to use these facilities,  and when my Mother in law explained the situation,  guest services was happy to accommodate us with wrist bands and parking until we could check into our condo later in the day.  Be sure to check out Barefoot Grill by the pool for burgers,  fries,  chicken tenders and more.  Piknix is a great place for ice cream and Starbucks is inside near the large indoor pool. There is a raw sushi bar inside and a really nice steakhouse in which you will want to dress up for.  Towels for the use of the three pools and three hot tubs are provided.  The view from their room is really nice.  Overall,  very impressed!", Nice place to stay. Lots of things to do. ,"Yo guys, listen up! I just had the most amazing time at this Resort Hotel and I need to tell you all about it!

First off, the location is simply stunning. It was nestled up against some gorgeous mountains and the view from my room was breathtaking. The hotel itself is modern with a clean and sleek design that I absolutely loved.

I also have to give a shoutout to the staff. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to make sure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable.

The hotel amenities are top-notch too! The pool was huge and the water was so refreshing. They also have a fantastic restaurant with lots of tasty food options, and the spa was the cherry on top of a perfect vacation.

Overall, I would highly recommend this Resort Hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious and relaxing getaway. I can't wait to go back again someday!"
666,SEA LIFE Kansas City,Tourist attraction,My 3 year old did enjoy his time here. I’m not sure about kids older than say 7-8. It wasn’t as big as I thought it would be. It’s mostly a linear walkthrough exhibit. Somewhat expensive for the experience. There are some cool interactive pieces., The kids and I enjoyed seeing the sea life up close. It was well designed for kids to see the sea life.  We enjoyed it more than the aquarium. ,"Yo, guys! If you're traveling to [name of place], then make sure to hit up this tourist attraction! I'm not kidding, this place is dope AF! The vibes are so chill and it's perfect for those Instagram shots you wanna take.

The staff were super friendly and helpful, and they made sure we had a really great time. The attraction itself is full of history and interesting facts that you won't get anywhere else. It's also visually stunning, so you're going to want to bring your camera (or phone) and snap away.

I don't want to give too much away, but let's just say that you're going to want to clear your schedule for a few hours because there's so much to explore here. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting [name of place]. It's a must-see attraction!"
375,Frankie's of Charlotte,Amusement park,My company threw us a summer party at Frankie's and it was so much fun. The catered food I am not sure if it came from Frankie's but it was soo good. We had alot of fun playing the virtual reality games along with the bumper cars indoors and the go karts outside were the high light of the day. the track is nice and the go karts drove smooth. I been on alot of go kart tracks where the carts dont run that well but these run smooth the are fairly fast for a go kart track and the lay out of the track was fun with the turns and what not. Anywho I would definitely recommend frankie's to families but children under 5 may not have that much fun. rides are reasonabley priced and for the cost of a dinner in movie you could go to Frankie's and have much more fun.," Had fun at Frankie's. I also went to Playhouse 90 and had fun there too. Frankie's had a lot of games I haven't seen before so that was cool. I really liked how the game card you used could be used at all the games and at the food stands I've never been to any place like that before.
Frankie's is pretty big place it's lots to do I'll prolly be going back sometime again. ","OMG! This amusement park is a blast! I couldn't stop screaming on their crazy roller coasters. They have rides for everyone, from kiddie rides to extreme thrill-seekers. The games are pretty cool too! I won a giant stuffed animal for my girlfriend. Plus, the food and drinks there are tasty and refreshing. There are plenty of tables and benches to sit and rest before hitting the next ride. The staff is friendly, super chill and helpful. I had such a great time that I can't wait to come back again! Highly recommend!"
538,"Crowne Plaza Shenandoah - Woodlands Area, an IHG Hotel",Hotel,Great place to stay. We have our Birthday celebration here for my Mother in law every year in their Ballroom. Great service all around from all the Staff.," Very nice and ""hip"" hotel. Lots of amenities, plus separate entrances for movie goers and diners at the restaurant next door. Definitely a fun place to stay for a few days. ","Yo, I gotta give a shoutout to this awesome hotel! Stayed here for a quick weekend getaway and it was everything I needed it to be. First off, the location was perfect - right in the heart of the city and close to all the cool spots. The lobby was super impressive with a grand entrance and friendly staff who were always willing to help out.

The room was clean, cozy and had everything I needed for my stay. The bed was comfy as heck and I had a great night's sleep. The bathroom was super clean and had some fancy toiletries that made me feel like a movie star. The hotel also had some great amenities, like a gym and a pool that I definitely took advantage of.

But what really made this hotel stand out was the customer service. The staff were so friendly and went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. They gave me some great recommendations for things to do in the area and even helped me with my bags when I was leaving.

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great stay in the city. Awesome location, clean and comfy rooms, and amazing customer service. Can't ask for much more than that!"
107,Electric Playhouse,Amusement center,"A very interesting form of entertainment here I must say. So you enter a brightly lit room to pay for entry….and then you go into a tunnel of neon lights and immediately are submerged into a neon maze of fun! There are several different activities to enjoy along with a drink station and bar. My son and I went and paid $18 a ticket for a pass for a few hours. Some of the games where really fun and interactive well others where kind of meh. The dodgeball space invader game and the larger than life breakout game where are favorites. The only downsides are it does get crowded and kind of smelly…I mean there’s lots of kids running around sweating 😅 also there isn’t that much to do considering majority of the main events get completed fairly quickly. We where kind of over it after an hour due to all the screaming kids but the initial wow factor is great. We decided to hit the snack bar and I was hoping for an adult beverage but no one would help us. The staff was in the kitchen dancing and the bartender only seemed interested in helping a certain group of people at the bar. So we left, I don’t think we will go back but it’s definitely something everyone should go try once"," Nice place where family can enjoy a piece of entertainment.
That place got bowling and a ropes course.  Lots of games for all ages.
Got league on sundays for all ages. Bring your own food and drinks. ","Yo guys! 

I recently visited this super dope amusement center and it was lit! There were so many cool things to do, I didn't even know where to start!

They had all sorts of games and activities that kept me and my friends entertained for hours. From laser tag to arcade games, there was something for everyone. And the best part? It wasn't even that expensive!

The staff was also really friendly and helpful, which is always a plus. They made sure we had everything we needed and even gave us some tips on how to beat some of the games.

Overall, if you're looking for a fun and exciting place to hang out with friends or family, this amusement center is definitely the spot to be at. Don't miss out on the fun!"
299,Hilton Sandestin Beach Golf Resort & Spa,Resort hotel,"We had mixed feelings about our stay at this Hilton.  First off, the pictures of the family suites are deceiving.   We thought their would be an extra room with a king or two doubles.  Their was not.  It's all one big room.  When you walk in their are bunk beds, (the ceiling was low and the ladder was steep) then a hallway, bathroom ( with no lock on it, by the way) then the bed with a table & sofa ( that turns into a bed) then balcony.   They do have multiple restaurants, but  all of them were pricey.  They did give us a free ice cream, it was pretty good.  Alex who checked us in was very helpful.

They have multiple pools, but if you dont get  out to the lounge chairs by seven your out of luck!  Beachfront was great!  You have to rent chairs & umbrellas for the beach, so we just brought our own.  The hot tub in the indoor pool jets did not work.

Overall we enjoyed our stay.
We ate a lot off property since we had a lot of activites planned.
We really enjoyed the beachfront access & the views."," We are very impressed by the hotel and its services.  Jermaine at the front desk was welcoming and friendly.  The valet guys are fast and also very friendly. 
Nice view from room, nicely decorated and clean.   Most important, the bed is very good! ","Yo, y'all gotta check out this resort hotel! This place is straight up amazing. The scenery is out of this world - I felt like I was in an island paradise with the palm trees and crystal clear water.

The rooms are super clean and comfortable. They've got all the amenities you need and more. The swimming pool is huge and there are plenty of lounge chairs to soak up the sun.

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed.

The food at the resort is to die for. There are a bunch of restaurants to choose from and the meals are delicious. We especially loved the seafood dishes - so fresh and tasty!

Overall, we had an incredible stay at this resort hotel. It's the perfect spot for a relaxing getaway with friends or family. Highly recommend it to anyone! 5 out of 5 stars!"
