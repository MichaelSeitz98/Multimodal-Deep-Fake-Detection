Very niche complaint here, I know, but this is so frustrating. Aside from some of the games being broken (some for several months now), new games like Music Diver end up lagging.

But one thing that could easily be fixed is removing the acrylic plates keeping people from scanning their cards or putting in their PIN numbers on the touch screen.

We just visited two days ago and they were having some kind of funeral, I really don't get how that would stop anyone from using the place... seems a weird day to block rooms altogether. My kids are older now so they don't care about the trampolines, climbing equipment or giant slide... THE ARCADE IS GONE! All the pinball, Ms. Pac Man and pool tables are gone! I'm disappointed about this because those are the groups I liked hanging around with.  The laser tag was reset and was fun but the kids prefer the big arcade, who didn't?

Will update as things are put back and I am hopeful enough to put on my gear again to ensure my lighting and fog machines have extras.

,,,Definitely not up to dorchester standards. The hotel is nice. I got really disappointed because we booked a suite for 10 days then left and booked the same suite when I came back for another few days. The first suite was extremely tiny it would even be considered small for a room. On the other hand when I came back and booked the same variety they gave me what was supposed to be a suite. Which is triple the size of the first one. The first one was also very far from the lobby a good 10 minute walk on the other hand the second suite we got was very close to the lobby.

The wait staff is outstanding and the service is quick and professional. There are always a major crowd of big folks (workers or out of towners) eating by the bar and on the benches by the window. A slight turn off is the lack of clear wait time information.

But I will say whoever set up the tables and benches had some awesome matching chairs and a dive bar feel to the whole front part of the restaurant.

,,,"I was very surprised at the Honeycomb. I was a bit trepidatious as I had never stayed at a B&B before, but I was happily rewarded. You can tell a lot of hard work and love have gone into creating this place, and the hard work continues.

We enjoyed the back deck immensely and found ourselves out there every night. While we were there the owners, Cindy and Earl began another project on the grounds, preparing an area for wedding ceremonies to be held. I am certain that is going to be a great addition to the property and well received in the area.

The breakfast service was excellent. As someone that loves to cook, I could easily see the passion that went into the morning meal.

The beds are amazingly comfortable and the sheets are out of this world comfortable. The great news is that you can buy the same sheets and bring home a brand new set for yourself.

Quartered potatoes are drenched with mayonnaise. Served on pure white sourdough slices. Pretty much like an upside down shoestring pretzel with a scoop of potato salad topped with a dollop of red potato coulis. For a moment it seemed like they may have forgotten I was there since they walked away without glancing my way, but they were only a few feet in the making my food.

,,,"A whole lot to say about our visit.

It was opening day so things were bound to go a bit sideways.

Pros:

Kammi our ref - absolutely amazing! She was attentive to the group, very friendly but had no problem calling out safety items the instant someone's mask wasn't all the way down or an uncovered barrell. She was great and I highly recommend you request her if you are taking a group.

The different games fields were fun and challenging. Our group had seasoned vets and first time adults and teens so it was well balanced. Kammi started us out easy and then introduced respawns and play until you're out of paint which everyone loved.

The field paint quality was really good in my opinion. Very consistent and I wish I had a marker that could really sling it.

The whole staff was friendly and went above and beyond to ensure everyone was safe and having fun.

Cons:

The hiccups of opening day with any business, but the owner and his team took it in stride and powered through.

Ran out of air so they were transporting tanks back and forth. Also ran out of cases of paint but that too was resolved with a trip the their warehouse.  These two items didn't affect our play or the amount of fun we had.

The rental markers were all over the place. Different models, broken detents, etc.  Once again - opening day, but it's on the calendar - clean and check everything weeks in advance. We replaced a few tank o-rings ourselves from our parts kits to save time.

No chronographing of walk on players. The rentals were slow and hot and some walk on teens were definitely pushing 300 fps. That's a safety thing especially with rental masks/lenses and horrible experience for young teens playing for the first time.

I am very glad our group made it down and even with said hiccups we had a blast and will be back in the future.",The Edge Paintball Experience,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMjd5VVZnEAE,Paintball center,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtFHn_w7ekkZ3pQlTwWf5_sHnttv2167G2xLwT=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPH5nVT8OI9fX8y1t4ddoJLzREWivW9iyLk9Uym=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMjd5VVZnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x1d7c0c9704eb3f0!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDW27yUVg%7CCgwIoPaukgYQwLChuQE%7C?hl=en-US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,activity,,,,,FAKE,ChIJHdE1hIMeBogR8LNOcMnA1wE,,A Google Maps review about a Paintball center. ###," Balls of fun.

,,,"Here‚Äôs the good and the bad and the very bad.

The good: The front desk staff who checked us in was very nice, the front office is very nice, and the shower was very nice. Get the picture?

The bad: this is an old motel that needs updating. The carpets are ripped, the sofa is ripped and covered up with a coverlet rather than replacing it, there is a mirror in front of the sofa rather than a TV to look at, and the bed is old and sagging in the middle. And this is an executive suite!Figure that out. Just look at the pictures.

The very bad: we booked a King executive suite. We were told that someone had already taken that suite and extended their stay. Instead of telling them that we had a reservation and that the motel could move them to another room, we were told that we would be moved to another room. We were given a queen executive suite. No discount. No offer of points. Just a ‚Äúsorry, we can‚Äôt guarantee a room.‚Äù  When we complained, the manager was quite generous (please note that is sarcasm) by giving  us a whole 500 points. Wow-wee!

The very very bad: And they have the nerve to charge over $200 for the room.

PS The microwave was unplugged and that was because it didn‚Äôt work, which I reported to the morning clerk. They don‚Äôt serve breakfast in the motel. You have to go next door to the restaurant and the tip is not included. But honestly, we wished we had skipped breakfast because the cook must‚Äôve had a bad morning and most of the food was not cooked enough - runny eggs although ordered fried hard, hash browns hard on one side/soft on the other, the same with the English muffin.

,,,"Came for dinner on Saturday evening.

HOSTS - we came to check in for our reservation at 4:57, we were told that our 5pm table was not ready yet and were asked to wait by the bar. After 10 minutes of no one coming to get us, we went back and asked to be seated.

DRINKS - we got the pink Vanderpump sangria and dirty cowboy, both were good.

FOOD - ordered the Tuna tartare, which was good, but extremely oily. The appetizer came out really fast. For main course we got the Mykonos salad and the Salmon salad, both were average. Brussels sprouts in the Salmon salad tasted burned and unseasoned.

FINAL THOUGHTS - the waiter has asked me to clarify my order three times which was kinda frustrating.

The issue I had were with front desk.  Did not have my room reservation when I checked in.  At one point I had over $1200 in temporary authorizations.  Went to front desk multiple times and was assured those temp charges would be removed at checkout.

Day of check out I ask for itemized list of charges which was at zero.  Couple hours later I receive a revised bill with me owing $259.  Call the resort and literally no one picks up the phone on multiple attempts to try and resolve this issue.

Have to send it to our company event coordinator to see if this will get fixed.

,,,"We are here last night, December 17th 2021, for my my husband's 28th birthday.

We have lived in Baldwin for 2 years and those years have been pretty rough, we were so lucky to find an apartment in sweet and quiet Baldwin City. We love it here and plan on buying a home. We've experienced quite a few events here but this was our first local restaurant. We were finally able to come to The Wooden Spoke after hearing so much about it and we brought friends from out of town.

What a charming, down-home, relaxed place. The parking lot felt like you were pulling into a old-time drive in, but you get out of your car and reach the door and it feels like you are standing outside of someone's well-loved home. The tables reminded me of my own kitchen tables in my childhood home. I felt comfortable as soon as I sat down. The waitress was extremely attentive, her energy was calm and sincere. Our drink orders were taken immediately, our appetizers came out quickly and the entrees were the best home cooking we all have had in many years.

We ordered the KC strip, the ribeye, the bourban steak and the spoke burger, spoke fries, mash potatoes, the chilli, mozzarella sticks, potato skins, and the wings in this beautiful honey brown sauce that was sweet, spicy, smoky and honestly it was incredible. I love WINGS and these took the trophy from me and my friends!

Our food and plates were hot, the food was fast. All the steaks were cooked as asked, all steaks were medium rare, juicy, delicious and quite big. Burger was done just well and had a classic burger taste.

The alcoholic beverages were delicious and made strong.

My daughter ordered the kids chicken strips and she said they were very good, we loved the fries. The spoke burger was amazing and the mustard tasted homemade. My husband especially loved the chilli. Overall, the food was spectacular. The service was fast and friendly, the environment was clean and comfy. We will definitely be back.

Thank you wooden spoke staff and mad respect and kudos to the Chef who made an unforgettable night full of nostalgic decor, warm and friendly interaction and phenomenal home-cooking! See you again soon!!

I have never stayed at a Wyndham hotel but it looked VERY nice in the photos and I never imagined it would be this dirty. The cleaning in this hotel... well there obviously wasn‚Äôt any real cleaning done. There should never be leftovers from other strangers in a hotel I paid for. I would have rather drove three more hours then not have a nice place to sleep and shower at. I am very upset and I have NEVER in my life wrote a review. I am not hard to please! The Wi-Fi code does not work. The phone does not work. The phone plug keeps falling out every time I pick up the phone. The top layer of the sheet had dirt on it or food. Looks like cake. I stay at many hotel. This is unacceptable. Also On top of this. I was told you guys price match. There was a deal online that was $20 cheaper than the right here and they said they could not do it. So even more annoyed right now that I came here because I thought I was getting a deal. After having heart issues with my bank it took a little longer than necessary which is totally my fault.

Livid to say the least. The cleaning lady left a envelope for a tip???? She has to be joking. She needs to be fired. Oh!!! and the what class that my daughter went to use had a big black hair in it. Look close at pics! Gross!!!!

,,,"We stopped at a quick one night stop to get some sleep, shower, and back get on the road. It was on the way to where we were headed, so it worked perfectly. Things that need improvement: 1. The thermostat. It was not accurate and as you can see my thermostat said it was 65% humidity, because theirs wasn‚Äôt working and wouldn‚Äôt trigger air on its own. My husband continued to smell mildew every time he walked into the room, I must have missed it the 2 times I walked in. 2. The vent, it could use some cleaning. I am not sure how clean the air we manually forced out of it was.
Good things on why I scored it high: 1. Price was great. 2. Location for us was awesome. 3. It did the job provide a nice firm mattress for us to get some good shut eye. The pillows could have been comfier, but for the price I will not complain! 4. The one person we interacted with at the desk was great. 5. Had a pool, we didn‚Äôt use it but I heard kids were enjoying it when I was checking in. 6. Overall thought things were relatively clean! 7. The bathroom was super cute and had a cool mirror/light. 8. There was a tv, but we didn‚Äôt use it. It was small for some standards, but I didn‚Äôt care as we were actually just using it for sleep.

If you are looking for a quick stop to get some good sleep and this is on the way, would 100% recommend.

,,,"Not a great experience overall. The only redeeming factors about the hotel are the price and the friendly employees. I stayed here while doing business in the area. I figured that swimming in one of 2 pools would be a great way to relax afterwards, especially for the price. Well, it could have definitely been better.

The first thing I noticed about the hotel is the smell of marijuana in the elevator. Then, when I got up to the hotel room, I tried to get in with the key cards they gave me. It took me no less than 10 tries to successfully use this card. I swiped it almost the same way 10 times, and it magically opened on the 10th.

The room itself was somewhat chilly when I got in. I changed the temperature and it started to heat up quickly. But, there was another odd burnt smell coming from the conditioner. It was dirty, too. Breakfast was decent. Food was nothing special, but the guy serving breakfast was awesome. Very friendly, even though I just had some coffee he offered me some freshly cooked food.

The pools were nice. Not too many people at night or during the day. Expect it to be more crowded at 9 pm than at 11 am, though. There were loads of what seemed to be pool algae all around the pool (dark green in color) but the water itself was clean. Good ambiance with the rocks and faux plants. Not too cold or too warm. Decent fitness center, too. Treadmill worked fine, they had dumbbells and a few other strength training machines. Pretty basic and small.

It's a bit tough to sleep during the night. They didn't give any pillows or blankets for the 2nd room with the pull out bed. You can hear everything and I was a bit concerned about a door near my room. People walking in and out all the time and you will surely hear some of that.

All in all, if you want a cheap hotel with 2 pools, this may be the place. The location is pretty convenient and the employees were very friendly. There are some cleanliness, room entrance, and sleeping issues, though.",Wyndham Garden Cross Lanes Charleston,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MlAySVpBEAE,Hotel,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnfIXn8WIDIMrCX3ZOqr-uF6M0EGbRSWprykHH=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MlAySVpBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xce89c841685108a9!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDu2P2IZA%7CCgwIicHblwYQuJW01QM%7C?hl=en-US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hotel,,,,,FAKE,ChIJNfgnzpjLSIgRqQhRaEHIic4,,A Google Maps review about a Hotel. ###," The staff was wonderful, but the hotel is worn out.

,,,"The waitress was great, and some of the food seemed really interesting considering we didn't intend on coming here but the place we were meaning to go to was closed. The place in dingy, so be prepared for that; the sign is in disrepair, badly needs paint, the patio section desperately needs to be remodeled, broken down cars out front (as well as a broken down boat). Now, as to the food: pretty good. I got the Rancocas Burger and was generally pretty impressed other than it being overcooked (ordered medium, came out well. I still ate it cause I'm not that annoying about my food). While I could be way off base, it had a sort of lack of flavor that's reminiscent of cheapish frozen beef.

,,,"A very special thank you to Reed F and Christian G. They made my stay enjoyable and were extremely accommodating and helpful given such short notice. Beautiful room, with a great view, along with plenty of amenities that make this a very desirable destination choice. They have a spa, golfing course within walking distance, a tram that runs every 20-30 minutes to nearby restaurants and outlet, and is situated in a gated community with security. However, I am extremely disappointed in the manner in which I was charged a $75 late fee checkout from Dawn Lucas. I am an Hilton Honors member and my room was without any heat the entire night. No one checked on the room, despite several inquires. I was freezing and slept for only a few hours. I asked for a late checkout to rest and have never had a problem with late checkouts before, even when hotels are at full occupancy. It wasn't so much the charge that bothered me but rather the manner and attitude I received regarding it. It was unprofessional and came across as extremely rude. Dawn almost seemed to take delight in charging the late fee, something that I felt extremely off putting. For those who see these, I caution you to be aware of their late checkout policies, especially if you are a Hilton Honors member, because I am now less hesitant to book my stay there again. Outside of that, this is a phenomenal hotel. The aforementioned gentleman at the front desk did an excellent job at accommodating all sorts of requests.

,,,"We are currently holding ""duel hotel citizenship "" between here and the neighboring Luau Condos next door. My in-laws and children are staying here so husband and I are back and forth.  We love the Sandestin Hilton for all the convenience of the restaurants and beach access.  You must have a wrist band to use these facilities,  and when my Mother in law explained the situation,  guest services was happy to accommodate us with wrist bands and parking until we could check into our condo later in the day.  Be sure to check out Barefoot Grill by the pool for burgers,  fries,  chicken tenders and more.  Piknix is a great place for ice cream and Starbucks is inside near the large indoor pool. There is a raw sushi bar inside and a really nice steakhouse in which you will want to dress up for.  Towels for the use of the three pools and three hot tubs are provided.

,,,"We had mixed feelings about our stay at this Hilton.  First off, the pictures of the family suites are deceiving.   We thought their would be an extra room with a king or two doubles.  Their was not.  It's all one big room.  When you walk in their are bunk beds, (the ceiling was low and the ladder was steep) then a hallway, bathroom ( with no lock on it, by the way) then the bed with a table & sofa ( that turns into a bed) then balcony.   They do have multiple restaurants, but  all of them were pricey.  They did give us a free ice cream, it was pretty good.  Alex who checked us in was very helpful.

They have multiple pools, but if you dont get  out to the lounge chairs by seven your out of luck!  Beachfront was great!  You have to rent chairs & umbrellas for the beach, so we just brought our own.  The hot tub in the indoor pool jets did not work.

Overall we enjoyed our stay.

,,,"This place is ""Starting"" to grow on me. Much better atmosphere than my visit back in November 2021. Masks are encouraged but not Forced on you. The Food court has gotten back into it's groove and the options are plentiful and given a 4 Day 3 night stay we had tried just about everything with no complaints. The main Restaurant was superb, my Steak couldn't have been cooked any better and exactly as I requested. Medium with no seasoning only salt and hint of cracked pepper. This place still has plenty of real table games(it's nice have a real human for a dealer). They still have a mix of virtual table machines but the balance was much better than a lot of other out of the way casino resorts are going. Great selection of slots but still like all the other casinos, they are very tight. The areas for those not able to gamble was open and they had plenty to do to keep them busy. I recommend you check out their website to see all the options and entrainment available to anyone traveling with young people. I seen quite a few on this trip and they seemed quite happy and talkative. In all, we enjoyed this visit but I still miss my Wisconsin favorites. However, this one will definitely grow on you. Enjoy and definitely Good Luck! You'll need it, Lol.
Update 8-14-22; I just spent two nights here and this place just keeps getting better. Slots seem to be a little less tight and I actually walked out ahead this time, significantly üòÅ. I noticed a lot more staff, slot attendants doing hand pays, Security, cleaning personal and the drink servers we're around checking up on everyone very regularly. I still have to get used to the higher drink prices (""We're not in Wisconsin anymore""üòÇ). The area is Beautiful and lots to do if you need a break and you're not in the gambling mood.

The room itself was a little sketchy with something growing on the wall, the ceiling was pealing in the corner and was breaking away along the exterior wall. The tub had serious rust stains, and the phone didn't work. That's relevant because I needed to call the front desk when I woke up and found that my car had been broken into.

I had to call on my phone and the front desk just asked what room I was in. They didn't even apologize that this crime had been committed, didn't offer to send someone to clean up the glass, call the cops, anything. And when I checked out they didn't say anything. I received more sympathy from the cops (just filed a report, they didn't send anyone out) and the glass repair company Safelite.

Second this is a extremely loud hotel. Every door opens and closes every room as we were next to a side entrance.

There‚Äôs construction work happening during daylight hours so it‚Äôs not just at night that it‚Äôs noisy and it‚Äôs quite disruptive.

It was the most amazingly comfortable mattress I've owned in the last 25 years.  I don't want to go through a night without it.
The Hyatt incorporates some recent innovations:
In your room are monitors for the following channels: ABC (yellow/logo), CBS (green/logo), FOX (blue/logo) and NBCUSA (red/logo).  Whoever they stole the layout from, please give them a raise.  That is fabulous!  Wish they painted the TV screen black though (why make a really cool feature look bad?).  But this is nitpicking.  The idea worked out fabulously, you can watch all four channels in your room.
The bathrooms worked well.  The head was warm and there was excellent pressure. They were two story, with a one story wing at the front.

A black and white drawing, consisting of one character in the drawing. The flight stick has moon and star on it. The driver looks out of the plane and finds a moon. Go figure, nobody knows what kind of plane this is, but in my imagination it is a German monoplane. It is a bi-plane with a striped roundel on the tail of the planes. Can this be a familiar aircraft registration to the Imperial Air Force that flew over the trenches in support of the kaiser‚Äôs ground assault to victory? We can guess.

,,,"This post should have been made in March 2021 but the trauma of the night is still a struggle for me.

I had been here once before and had a decent time. We paid extra for VIP and side lot parking. This night that lot was full and we parked on a side lot that was ‚Äúmonitored / guarded.‚Äù We got there and did not do a VIP experience as we had time to kill. It felt like the line did not move and easily an hour after standing in line we made it to the front of the building. We were 4 or 5 groups back and the line completely stopped. Across from us was the VIP line for the front door and they were not permitted to enter either. Several people from both lines would knock and ask questions but were disrespected.

Visitors had purchased tickets online and did not wish to continue to wait. They knocked to see if they could get a date adjustment and still the doors would be slammed in their face. There wasn‚Äôt a special uniform for the workers so when people knocked some would be allowed entry but no one updated the crowd outside. Eventually after a 2 hour wait (from arrival) the security guard shared they were short staffed and had to allow some people to clear out. There was no apology or anything just blatant disrespect to paying customers.

When we arrived and paid to park in the trap museum lot it was early evening and the lot was lit up by sunlight. By the time we finished the museum we came out to night time. The lot we paid to park in was not well lit when we returned to my vehicle. I found my vehicle damaged, articles stolen and when I asked the attendant he radioed a manager as he was too busy and didn‚Äôt know anything happened.

We spoke with the representative or manager who went by the name A1. He did not provide his full name but assured us they would fix my window. This time of evening we could not get anyone out and due to Covid mobile window repairs were limited. Still A1 shared the museum would cover the costs. The police came and took a report along with dusting for fingerprints. The thieves not only broke my window they damaged my glove compartment that had my Glock locked inside of it. They stole work items to include files, electronics and my work laptop. The serial numbers of all of my items were added to the police report.

I am a business owner and could not work for a month as I had to work to replace the electronics, files and missed opportunities to make money as I did not have the tools. I shared this with A1 and a lady named Adlia along with sharing the price point for replacing my window. I submitted all of my receipts for my window, loss work and equipment in hopes they would replace my work electronics as a thank you to a military veteran. It was wishful thinking but they mentioned they were short staffed, they pretended to understand how this interrupted my night and work as well.

They offered to cashapp me $300 for my window and a we are sorry that happened. Window itself was $300 and that did not include emergency installation. This place gave me a real life experience of what it means to support the trap.

These places include: a silversmith shop, work of the famous Frederic Remington, traditional wagon shop, and a beautiful world-wide tapestry that surrounds the center.  The exhibits change monthly and include many things ranging from history to fine arts. The original museum was a museum of slides from around the world. Later additional slides were added. Each slide set the stage for an exhibit in the museum. It was very interesting to see all that was in the facility before any of industrialization occurred in the area. This was a fun place to enjoy a fun day out with kids or siblings. It's also well mapped around on OPO. The staff is friendly and non aggressive on selling you things even though they know it's business...unlike many many other places you will come across.

,,,"This was a great experience! We did the Sporting KC room with 5 adults plus a 5-year old and loved it! No spoilers, so all I'll say is don't let the small room deceive you. Plenty of clever things to discover.

They will give as many hints as you would like. Only the first requested 3 hints are free though. Anything beyond those 3 result in a 3-minute penalty each. You still get a full hour to break out, no matter how many hints you use. You're time will just look longer than one hour. This is how people get scores of 64 minutes, even though you only have an hour max.

The do give free hints if they see that you're stuck. These do not count against your 3 free requested hints, nor do they penalize your time.

My advice for the uninitiated is to not be afraid to use the hints! Especially if you're not going to try again at a later date. Enjoy the puzzles, but don't let them frustrate you. Make sure someone is keeping track of time so that you can pace the free hints.

The parking was a bit confusing. The building is close to some apartments and there's a few signs that explicitly say ""no parking"" for break out KC. Parking directly in front of the entrance says ""for tenants and patrons only"", which we had no idea what that meant.

So many zookeepers are working with and interacting with the animals. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. ,A Google Maps review about a Zoo. ###," We really enjoyed this park. The Zoo is small but there are a lot of animals to see. Definitely a place we would put on our list if we ever decide to make our way back to Bowling Green!

We've viewed a lot of zoos in our 26 years of parenting, this one is a keeper! It is well stocked with the needed features. With a small staff, Ohio wild life even gutted a log cabin for them. The kids loved it. The tot walk area was utilized. They have a small train that kids enjoyed riding. The train flew them over the Otter. They were so cute that such a short, unimposing creature was so popular. Visitors were generous with the honey bees.

I would definitely recommend this place to family and friends. "," Got lucky riding my bike over the bridge but STILL did not see any animals. I mean BILLIONS of people go see animals everyday and ... they HAVE to see them here.

And I‚Äôm glad he didn‚Äôt take time for the sun dial to tell me it‚Äôs no longer an accurate representation, which would have caused the museum to lose out on all sorts of unproductive time researching when, if, for how long, etc sun dials, moon dials, water clocks and sundials etc have been used to tell time. Instead he told me the history and functionality without saying that it no longer is an accurate representation (because of course history repeats !!) leaving me to remember that sometimes it‚Äôs more pleasing (and magical) to total immerse in the experience rather than question your sanity and see the numbers like in the digital world.
There‚Äôs nothing he could have done to improve. It was all just perfect. Thank you to him and the library.

,,,Not good at all. Staff all nice yes but the condition of the hotel overall not ok. The cleanliness was poor. Some rooms are unfinished. Some smell like urine. Very drafty during the winter. Breakfast was trash. And there are bed bugs and bettles present in some areas and rooms this was the BIGGEST DISGUST AND TURN OFF. I do not have bugs of any type in my home and NEVER have much less in my bed so with that being said I will not sell myself short in someone else's establishment that's meant to make others feel comfortable.  I was un easy the remainder of my stay and had to do alot of mental conditioning to get past what i seen even after switching rooms... I'm a super visual person and once i see something its difficult to un see. I will not be back and wish like hell I could atleast get half of my money back for the major inconvenience. For this to not have been discovered tells me someone is not doing their job or fair share here. Thanks but no thanks Days Inn.

,,,"Pros: some fun stuff for kids! Go karts, bumper boats, rock climb, trampoline jump. There are also laser tag and mini golf available. There is a game room with some arcade style games, snacks, etc. Kids will love everything here, and you might too.

Cons: EXPENSIVE! Understand before you go that tickets for just outside activities are $30 per person... For 2 hours. That's $120 for a family of 4. Want to play a doubt of mini golf? That's not included... That's another $18... Per person. So now you're up to $200. Wanna try laser tag?it's very fun, but also not included.

Your kids will want to play the arcade games to win tickets, you can buy game passes for a time limit.

During fully open operation and during the summer it is *crowded* so lines are long so be prepared to wait.

Bottom line - kids will have a blast, go on off-peak days if you can, look online or ask about packages for activities and games, and be prepared to shell out a lot of money for the afternoon; if you're not ready to either drop a couple hundred bucks or disappoint the kids by telling them ""no"" then maybe come back a different time.",Hinkle Fun Center,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaEppWGpBRRAB,Amusement center,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCltabjNCyLvbb3_9NILsQYFXghdXfJlUSJLfw=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuzGWmvQohHP8cPa4yYabmBAQNflVbvLqFtbX4=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaEppWGpBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x412edc9effd42a9e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDqhJiXjAE%7CCgwIyfrnhgYQsMbajQE%7C?hl=en-US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,activity,,,,,FAKE,ChIJo3u9FkagGIcRnirU_57cLkE,,A Google Maps review about a Amusement center. ###, This was my first time coming to Frankie's.

My date and I went to J. Alexander's for a quick workday lunch. It took a while to be seated (no complaints, because it was the lunch rush) and the table service made up for it because our server was prompt and efficient. We both wanted something light and landed on the same thing: the Thai Kai Salad ($16) with chicken, mixed greens, and peanuts tossed in a cilantro vinaigrette with Thai peanut sauce, along with a croissant on the side. It was a great salad and we both enjoyed it because the dressing was flavorful and tangy, had nice pieces of cold-yet-grilled chicken, and we left feeling full.

,,,"1 star for a subpar/gross experience at Chicago Getaway Hostel. I rented a private room for 3 nights looking for a clean/decent place to sleep and shower while I was in the city for a work project. Chicago Getaway Hostel did not fit the bill.

The Hostel is in a beautiful Lincoln Park neighborhood with tons of giant trees and you really can't find a better location to get the LP vibe but then walk a block to hop on trains/buses. The cost for a private room is comparable to a hotel room, but I chose this place because it's location was within walking distance to where I was going to be working. After looking at reviews and photos of the hostel, it seemed like a very modern and clean place that I would be comfortable staying at... unfortunately the photos were deceiving and the reviews did not represent my experience.

When I walked up to the building, I had to walk through a crowd of people gathering on the sidewalk outside the hostel smoking (great for my asthma) to enter the building. This happened every time I entered/exited the building over the next few days, which was a real turn off to me. The check in process was quick - the person checking me in rushed through all of the instructions and gave me no written document that verified what he went over, so that was fun.

My room looked nice at first glance - 2 bunk beds, a desk, shower/toilet/sink. All the essentials. Upon further investigation here's what I found (some photos attached)... the bathroom was absolutely disgusting. I don't know when it was last cleaned, but it had to have been a long time. The amount of dirt/grime built up in that shower made me feel dirtier than I was when I walked in. One shouldn't have to buy flip flops to shower in a private room bathroom they rented. There was buildup ON THE SHOWER HEAD where the clean water is supposed to come out of but there was nastiness caked on so it passed through that first.

The beds were pretty uncomfortable. The mattress was very thin and I could feel the bars through it, so it was rough sleeping. A majority of the linens had a ton of stains/loose hairs on them (especially the pillows) and they were very rough in texture. All of this combined made me feel very gross and like the room hadn't been cleaned at all. For the price of a hotel room I'd expect a much higher level of cleanliness from this place.

Needless to say, I will not be back.",Chicago Getaway Hostel,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBX0pyaTNnRRAB,Hostel,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVHBocKpYgIfkuqQocbpequ1nmlV_aHoNMgctm=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGBZ4KoSDjWafS2AP9umOC-Qa5WC4QtakyClYi=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCgVIkgklQss-62dfcA-J6L5MNxOrWbyv4jBO3=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtt-HTpcJ5g0WuvVyCS95oLGj-knaK2pkqL1XJ=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBX0pyaTNnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xe7048c084e9305f!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICA_Jri3gE%7CCgwIxczN3QUQqO_NugM%7C?hl=en-US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hotel,,,,,FAKE,ChIJq7mvQQ7TD4gRXzDphMBIcA4,,A Google Maps review about a Hostel. ###," Nice Pub Hostel.

Heritage River Adventure is what it says, an amazing almost new interactive adventure park. I really liked the excitement of being a little older kid when I was a younger kid.

The staff is very friendly, helpful and less expensive then other places in the area due to their location.
I loved jumping off the few different slide areas. You can actually slide to the other side of the river without having to enter a water park. They actually added little zip lines to help you get back even faster.

,,,"I'm visiting here from Delaware, and I wasn't sure what to expect since the existing reviews are nowhere near consistent. I booked the hotel room through Agoda based solely on the fact that it was a very short (and safe) walk to Oven's Auditorium where my granddaughter's graduation from Hawthorne Academy was scheduled to take place. Overall, I am happy with the room. While it's far from the best place I've ever stayed, and the main elevator has been out of order the entire time I've been here, it has still been an enjoyable stay. The two photos that accompany my review are my photos taken with my Moto phone, not stock photos. My room was very clean upon my arrival. While the furniture was a little dated with a scuff here and there, everything was functional. A little Old English Scratch Cover would definitely make a huge difference in the existing furniture. That said, would I stay here again? Absolutely. The staff was very friendly. They offered me the use of their service elevator to go back and forth to my third floor room, which I thought was really nice since I'm almost 67 years old, and I don't particularly like flights of stairs. The only real disappointment was the fact that the hotel restaurant was permanently closed. Perhaps it was a victim of Covid. I'm not sure. There is a circa 1955 burger establishment almost directly across the highway, but you cannot walk there unless you want to take your life in your hands crossing the very busy highway. I wouldn't try it even if I were Usain Bolt in his prime. But I did drive there, and it only took me about 5 minutes using Google Go directions. (Their Ribeye sandwich was the best I've ever eaten.)  So yeah, I would definitely stay here again. It is ranked as a 3-star hotel, and I give it 4 stars myself because I felt very safe here, and they went out of their way to accommodate me.

It's good. For being closed during the rehab it's common to see things pristine inside. Reception is clean. The updated rooms are nice as well.

ROOM: The room was cheap in comparison to some other gamblers out there. BUT it was not well kept. The inside of the shower is black.... not just a moldy looking cleaning solution. The outside is clean. This room would need a total gutting and remodel to be anything more than a good $80 shot. It doesn't even have a wall phone in the room. There is a phone on the dresser, which is not reliable for calling out.

Amenities: The arcade is nice and has something new to see every few minutes.
