Very niche complaint here, I know, but this is so frustrating. Aside from some of the games being broken (some for several months now), new games like Music Diver end up lagging.

But one thing that could easily be fixed is removing the acrylic plates keeping people from scanning their cards or putting in their PIN numbers on the touch screen. Part of the appeal of these games is the ability to save progress (that's what keeps me coming back), but these silly shields protecting the cabinets are in the way.

If possible, go during the WEEKDAY for Unlimited bowl until 5pm for $11.99. I've hurt my arms & shoulders from bowling way too many games during this inexpensive time and improved my bowling scores.  (Thank you Round 1).

I've enjoyed going to Round 1 to relax and enjoy the oversized Pac-man game and bowl some stress away.  I have not tried the food nor drinks there because I just go in to play games.

Mostly clean, spacious and social distancing  protocols are  in effect.  Team members were constantly cleaning.  My only negative comment is that no one has cleaned the escalator entrance and it looks unwelcoming/unsightly.

3.0,2022-04-04T08:06:09,Muneera Abdulmohsen,Definitely not up to dorchester standards. The hotel is nice. I got really disappointed because we booked a suite for 10 days then left and booked the same suite when I came back for another few days. The first suite was extremely tiny it would even be considered small for a room. On the other hand when I came back and booked the same variety they gave me what was supposed to be a suite. Which is triple the size of the first one. The first one was also very far from the lobby a good 10 minute walk on the other hand the second suite we got was very close to the lobby.

Not allowed to get different meat choices for each burrito without a crazy upcharge so he got all pork. They were pretty bland and the pork was dry but had enough sauce to be edible.

Never heard about or used it before but it seemed it had got nice reviews and ratings on several travel websites. The price was also very good, especially compared to those resorts and cabins inside RMNP (Riding Mountain National Park). These are attractive enough so I decided to give it a try.

I have to tell you that I was not disappointed at all even though I  set my expectation very high. This B&B is right out of the town of Onanole, on a small hill right beside Hwy 10. Only 7km from the entrance of RMNP, you have easy and quick access to the park while still enjoy the quiet and beautiful setting of the B&B. The historic building has been beautifully restored and tastefully decorated. The room feels cozy and the bed is comfortable and supportive. The full breakfast (with bacon, egg/omelette, toasts, fruits, and coffee) was delicious. There are lots of other amenities for the gusts to enjoy, like the huge deck, the lounge room with TV, etc. Too bad I stayed for two nights only and was too busy to fully enjoy them.

We enjoyed the back deck immensely and found ourselves out there every night. While we were there the owners, Cindy and Earl began another project on the grounds, preparing an area for wedding ceremonies to be held. I am certain that is going to be a great addition to the property and well received in the area.

The breakfast service was excellent. As someone that loves to cook, I could easily see the passion that went into the morning meal.

The beds are amazingly comfortable and the sheets are out of this world comfortable. The great news is that you can buy the same sheets and bring home a brand new set for yourself.

So you enter a brightly lit room to pay for entry….and then you go into a tunnel of neon lights and immediately are submerged into a neon maze of fun! There are several different activities to enjoy along with a drink station and bar. My son and I went and paid $18 a ticket for a pass for a few hours. Some of the games where really fun and interactive well others where kind of meh. The dodgeball space invader game and the larger than life breakout game where are favorites. The only downsides are it does get crowded and kind of smelly…I mean there’s lots of kids running around sweating 😅 also there isn’t that much to do considering majority of the main events get completed fairly quickly. We where kind of over it after an hour due to all the screaming kids but the initial wow factor is great. We decided to hit the snack bar and I was hoping for an adult beverage but no one would help us. The staff was in the kitchen dancing and the bartender only seemed interested in helping a certain group of people at the bar.

Parking was $55 for 1 night! Room service breakfast (everything else was closed) cost $75! (Oatmeal, toast, eggs, pancakes, coffee for 2  and it was cold). The bathroom has no space for a bag or anything. The sink is non standard height (too low), the lamps are all crooked (about 45 degrees), the walls are unfinished concrete, and electrical outlets are gang boxes fed by 1"" and 1/2"" conduits.

The second room assign for us was better, we thought. But, there was a ""boxed water"" with only half inside. Have no idea whether it was served by the hotel or left by the previous customer. BUT it is only half bottle. Then when we woke up this morning, we figured out there is a stain on the comforter. We suspected it was a blood stain. Then we found the hotel manager, he kept saying that everything has been washed and he could guarantee that this is clean.

It is not only the quality of this hotel. We could bear the mistakes. BUT the attitude of the manager and the front desk was disgusting. In their thoughts, once we reached the supervisor, the problem should have been finished, even we were not OK with their solutions. And they also said so when we tried to reach out the supervisor again since we are not satisfied with the solution, like “you have already met my supervisor, and this problem now should have been solved.

With the noise we couldn’t even sleep.  When we ask them for option the only option is either the traffic noise or club noise.  I think they should be giving a decent room to people who stay and pay such price.
Update: they moved us in different room the noise was same.  Room had many issues outlet not working, bad plumbing. So for the noise in this 4 star they are just offering white machine as a solution.  The night lady staff said at this time we don’t address issues like that at this time as if noise, electrical outlets and plumbing issues had business hours. Then why are you there for?  I have posted pic to show plumbing issue in this room was really bad starting from the time we checked in and the room i was provided with their “engineer” was working on.

4.0,2022-04-05T03:44:32,Dean Krapf,"A whole lot to say about our visit.

It was opening day so things were bound to go a bit sideways.

Pros:

Kammi our ref - absolutely amazing! She was attentive to the group, very friendly but had no problem calling out safety items the instant someone's mask wasn't all the way down or an uncovered barrell. She was great and I highly recommend you request her if you are taking a group.

The different games fields were fun and challenging. Our group had seasoned vets and first time adults and teens so it was well balanced. Kammi started us out easy and then introduced respawns and play until you're out of paint which everyone loved.

The field paint quality was really good in my opinion. Very consistent and I wish I had a marker that could really sling it.

The whole staff was friendly and went above and beyond to ensure everyone was safe and having fun.

Cons:

The hiccups of opening day with any business, but the owner and his team took it in stride and powered through.

Ran out of air so they were transporting tanks back and forth. Also ran out of cases of paint but that too was resolved with a trip the their warehouse.  These two items didn't affect our play or the amount of fun we had.

The rental markers were all over the place. Different models, broken detents, etc.  Once again - opening day, but it's on the calendar - clean and check everything weeks in advance. We replaced a few tank o-rings ourselves from our parts kits to save time.

No chronographing of walk on players. The rentals were slow and hot and some walk on teens were definitely pushing 300 fps. That's a safety thing especially with rental masks/lenses and horrible experience for young teens playing for the first time.

I am very glad our group made it down and even with said hiccups we had a blast and will be back in the future.",The Edge Paintball Experience,,,,4.6,2.0,True,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMjd5VVZnEAE,Paintball center,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtFHn_w7ekkZ3pQlTwWf5_sHnttv2167G2xLwT=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPH5nVT8OI9fX8y1t4ddoJLzREWivW9iyLk9Uym=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMjd5VVZnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x1d7c0c9704eb3f0!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDW27yUVg%7CCgwIoPaukgYQwLChuQE%7C?hl=en-US,113737575556195080059,296.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SoolYwEt4KS21sSnH3TMTmR8UCIAQKt8arREpnoA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113737575556195080059?hl=en-US,134,2023-03-26T11:02:50.981Z,Wisconsin,5946 US-51,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/The+Edge+Paintball+Experience/@42.5930271,-90.1429939,9z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x88061e838435d11d:0x1d7c0c9704eb3f0!8m2!3d42.5929872!4d-89.0223799!16s%2Fg%2F12hk1kwtj?hl=en",https://www.608pb.com/,Paintball center,,,Paintball center,activity,"[('cons', 0.3085), ('visit', 0.3083), ('pros', 0.2801), ('fun', 0.2559), ('kits', 0.255)]","['cons', 'visit', 'pros', 'fun', 'kits']","[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.42311805486679077}]",,real,ChIJHdE1hIMeBogR8LNOcMnA1wE,335

Went to the housekeeping cart & called out into a room I assumed was being cleaned & nobody answered or was in the room. I put my dirty towels in the bag hanging off the cart & grabbed clean ones & was good to go. No worries.  Put a do not disturb on my door & all was well. My complaint is that there were so many flies in my room when I arrived on the day before. I used a hand towel & killed them all. The a/c filters were filled with lint, like a clothes dryer filter. (The pictures I'm showing here are AFTER I cleaned them). I pulled them out & banged them together outside my door & the lint flew off into the wind. Then I rinsed them off in the shower & dried them & put them back. No worries 👍 sneezing problem solved. Also had to use a hand towl in room 114 to slam in the bottom of the entry door where critters could crawl in from outside.  The insulation on the bottom right corner of the door was missing.  Showerhead had bad water pressure due to corrosion as well & several outlets in the room didn't work. Other than that the place isn't that bad. I'll return for work but bring a flyswatter & clean the a/c filters in the room with each visit.",Best Western Colorado River Inn,,"Located just off Historic Route 66, this laid-back hotel is a mile from both Rivers Edge Golf Course and Needles Marina Park.

2.0,2022-10-07T21:00:00,Randy M,"Here’s the good and the bad and the very bad.

The good: The front desk staff who checked us in was very nice, the front office is very nice, and the shower was very nice. Get the picture?

The bad: this is an old motel that needs updating. The carpets are ripped, the sofa is ripped and covered up with a coverlet rather than replacing it, there is a mirror in front of the sofa rather than a TV to look at, and the bed is old and sagging in the middle. And this is an executive suite!Figure that out. Just look at the pictures.

The very bad: we booked a King executive suite. We were told that someone had already taken that suite and extended their stay. Instead of telling them that we had a reservation and that the motel could move them to another room, we were told that we would be moved to another room. We were given a queen executive suite. No discount. No offer of points. Just a “sorry, we can’t guarantee a room.”  When we complained, the manager was quite generous (please note that is sarcasm) by giving  us a whole 500 points. Wow-wee!

The very very bad: And they have the nerve to charge over $200 for the room.

PS The microwave was unplugged and that was because it didn’t work, which I reported to the morning clerk. They don’t serve breakfast in the motel. You have to go next door to the restaurant and the tip is not included. But honestly, we wished we had skipped breakfast because the cook must’ve had a bad morning and most of the food was not cooked enough - runny eggs although ordered fried hard, hash browns hard on one side/soft on the other, the same with the English muffin.

Recommendation? Try another hotel/motel in the area if you can.",Best Western Colorado River Inn,,"Located just off Historic Route 66, this laid-back hotel is a mile from both Rivers Edge Golf Course and Needles Marina Park.

I am paranoid about travelling due to the current pandemic, but I didn’t have a worry in the world with how spotless and clean this room was. Felt comfortable, and like home. No dirt, dust bunnies ANYWHERE.

Check in was fast an efficient. This motel could be charging way more than they are for the quality of rooms they provide.

The rooms had pots, pans, dishes, utensils, and whatever else you could need to make yourself a quick meal if you didn’t feel like going out to a nearby restaurant.

The bed was comfy, which is a rare find in most motels. They also has 3 different mattress protectors on the mattress itself, all extremely clean. They provide an additional blanket on top of the shelf as well.

I was also extremely grateful for the working air conditioner, another rare find in motels.

Very homey and family friendly as well, which comes through in the flavors of the food and the attentiveness of the staff. Compared to Marina and Holy Land, they definitely improve on quality in many ways, as the senior staff have years of experience that imbue the restaurant.

2.0,2021-06-29T16:34:18,Shani Levi,"Came for dinner on Saturday evening.

HOSTS - we came to check in for our reservation at 4:57, we were told that our 5pm table was not ready yet and were asked to wait by the bar. After 10 minutes of no one coming to get us, we went back and asked to be seated.

DRINKS - we got the pink Vanderpump sangria and dirty cowboy, both were good.

FOOD - ordered the Tuna tartare, which was good, but extremely oily. The appetizer came out really fast. For main course we got the Mykonos salad and the Salmon salad, both were average. Brussels sprouts in the Salmon salad tasted burned and unseasoned.

FINAL THOUGHTS - the waiter has asked me to clarify my order three times which was kinda frustrating. I also don’t understand why we couldn’t be seated when we were early to a reservation that the restaurant was extremely empty. When I moved my chair back I bumped into the table behind me which also had a party seated there.

I came for the hype, but I will not be dining here again.",PUMP Restaurant Lounge,,TV celeb Lisa Vanderpump's spot for upscale New American dining & drinks in ritzy garden environs.,$$,4.2,12.0,True,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxbE1ESDlBRRAB,New American restaurant,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7o67Le7izQ8CmkMlJki-44XerQeGnYQtWm34q=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEmUNlYPjglOtuj4ZLQo2tVGjILQTPEN_x_YY5=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO58kqZWyGlleqGEeijJM-FvB4TZoElQNOM7Mg8=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdtLRZ4q-9JJpCeZGJITKvyeQ65ElyUpytYTx4=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxbE1ESDlBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x19f0a77bfa3289fb!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDqlMDH9AE%7CCgsIipfthgYQqJ7UIA%7C?hl=en-US,110898019882196614828,76.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5R3cCBnq9p_fUg8aPMjL5wXPYh1xn7WkKbURX_T=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110898019882196614828?hl=en-US,1537,2023-03-26T09:36:20.677Z,California,8948 Santa Monica Blvd,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/PUMP+Restaurant+Lounge/@34.0604001,-118.3866381,13z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x80c2beaf6203472d:0x19f0a77bfa3289fb!8m2!3d34.0837453!4d-118.3852852!16s%2Fg%2F11b6wknyj2?hl=en",http://pumprestaurant.com/,New American restaurant,Italian restaurant,Lounge,New American restaurant,restaurant,"[('dining', 0.4781), ('dinner', 0.4351), ('restaurant', 0.3883), ('table', 0.3674), ('waiter', 0.3616)]","['dining', 'dinner', 'restaurant', 'table', 'waiter']","[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47343307733535767}]",,real,ChIJLUcDYq--woAR-4ky-nun8Bk,185

However, we weren’t really dressed to impress, and we also didn’t have time to go back to our hotel and do so (we had to get up super early for our departing flights). But, once arriving at the door, we were greeted with a friendly face and told that we could take a seat anywhere in the lounge. We went straight to the bar and the bartender assisted us immediately. We were very impressed with the service, despite our casual attire. We then took a seat, and we were immediately greeted by a server. He was so friendly!

4.0,2021-09-20T20:26:31,Chris Jacques,"Stayed here for a work event in Mid September.  Very nice resort and location.  Beds were comfortable.  Beach and multiple pools were very nice as well. Food was quite good at various restaurants.

The issue I had were with front desk.  Did not have my room reservation when I checked in.  At one point I had over $1200 in temporary authorizations.  Went to front desk multiple times and was assured those temp charges would be removed at checkout.

Day of check out I ask for itemized list of charges which was at zero.  Couple hours later I receive a revised bill with me owing $259.  Call the resort and literally no one picks up the phone on multiple attempts to try and resolve this issue.

Have to send it to our company event coordinator to see if this will get fixed.

My advice is to watch your bill closely at this hotel.  Never could get a straight explanation on what all these various charges were for and the answer was different every time I asked.",The Westin Hilton Head Island Resort & Spa,,"This upscale beachfront resort is 0.5 miles from Port Royal Golf & Racquet Club and 1.3 miles from the Adventure Cove entertainment center.

The 3 subs were delivered at 5:25 PM CST and the delivery girl told me she forgot the small double pepperoni pizza. Tell me why it's 6:37 PM CST and the pizza was just now delivered.

I wanted to try it for a while now and it didn't disappoint me at all.
We ordered a Large Pepperoni Pizza half Chicken and Sausage. The ingredients tasted fresh and the pizza was well made. We chose the Garlic Herbs flavor on the crust. It was tasty and very garlicky.

5.0,2021-12-18T21:11:51,Leah Michelle,"We are here last night, December 17th 2021, for my my husband's 28th birthday.

We have lived in Baldwin for 2 years and those years have been pretty rough, we were so lucky to find an apartment in sweet and quiet Baldwin City. We love it here and plan on buying a home. We've experienced quite a few events here but this was our first local restaurant. We were finally able to come to The Wooden Spoke after hearing so much about it and we brought friends from out of town.

What a charming, down-home, relaxed place. The parking lot felt like you were pulling into a old-time drive in, but you get out of your car and reach the door and it feels like you are standing outside of someone's well-loved home. The tables reminded me of my own kitchen tables in my childhood home. I felt comfortable as soon as I sat down. The waitress was extremely attentive, her energy was calm and sincere. Our drink orders were taken immediately, our appetizers came out quickly and the entrees were the best home cooking we all have had in many years.

We ordered the KC strip, the ribeye, the bourban steak and the spoke burger, spoke fries, mash potatoes, the chilli, mozzarella sticks, potato skins, and the wings in this beautiful honey brown sauce that was sweet, spicy, smoky and honestly it was incredible. I love WINGS and these took the trophy from me and my friends!

Our food and plates were hot, the food was fast. All the steaks were cooked as asked, all steaks were medium rare, juicy, delicious and quite big. Burger was done just well and had a classic burger taste.

The alcoholic beverages were delicious and made strong.

My daughter ordered the kids chicken strips and she said they were very good, we loved the fries. The spoke burger was amazing and the mustard tasted homemade. My husband especially loved the chilli. Overall, the food was spectacular. The service was fast and friendly, the environment was clean and comfy. We will definitely be back.

Thank you wooden spoke staff and mad respect and kudos to the Chef who made an unforgettable night full of nostalgic decor, warm and friendly interaction and phenomenal home-cooking! See you again soon!!

I wish I could add more photos but it was such a good time, I didn't think about taking a bunch, I just soaked in the night! ⚪️",Wooden Spoke Restaurant,,,$,4.3,1.0,True,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcE5pcmxRRRAB,American restaurant,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWwdSIoOEa__KhIYQtiL-kcM8wafXIFGTiZMCU=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlL4zikJIA7NqBku2MioazeWnnOvZgZgs7ddFY=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPleGLelncDH_42hSkW0ygx5Kbm-6ZRRc8VGtUq=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtPNOrn4wis2h-8mb4NtOcTigJPfE1DUf8cDra=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcE5pcmxRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xb991bc4a4a706f2c!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICmpNirlQE%7CCgwIl535jQYQqMD1qgE%7C?hl=en-US,116279269889306605644,59.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5TyXezcEUmMJ5T7rUESB-0IZm5EFiDDJ9A8IC9cHls=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116279269889306605644?hl=en-US,222,2023-03-26T09:37:24.460Z,Kansas,309 Ames St,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Wooden+Spoke+Restaurant/@38.9180532,-95.2268702,10z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x87bf5b84df236a35:0xb991bc4a4a706f2c!8m2!3d38.782004!4d-95.1824808!16s%2Fg%2F1v_nd09_?hl=en",https://woodenspokerestaurant.com/,American restaurant,Takeout Restaurant,Sandwich shop,American restaurant,restaurant,"[('restaurant', 0.4157), ('appetizers', 0.3532), ('steaks', 0.3384), ('decor', 0.3381), ('entrees', 0.3345)]","['restaurant', 'appetizers', 'steaks', 'decor', 'entrees']",,,real,ChIJNWoj34Rbv4cRLG9wSkq8kbk,411

1.0,2019-06-24T02:41:33,Nikki Westerfield,"I am disgusted. As I just sit in this bed because I don’t want me feet all over who knows how many guests before me. We stopped here so we didn’t have to continue to drive on our long trip. All we wanted was a clean hotel where we could sleep and shower with our two children! The shower even has black hairs! Black hairs were all over the first room and we asked to switch to find the same thing. The floors are not vacuumed at all. It’s unreal. I have never stayed at a Wyndham hotel but it looked VERY nice in the photos and I never imagined it would be this dirty. The cleaning in this hotel... well there obviously wasn’t any real cleaning done. There should never be leftovers from other strangers in a hotel I paid for. I would have rather drove three more hours then not have a nice place to sleep and shower at. I am very upset and I have NEVER in my life wrote a review. I am not hard to please! The Wi-Fi code does not work. The phone does not work. The phone plug keeps falling out every time I pick up the phone. The top layer of the sheet had dirt on it or food. Looks like cake. I stay at many hotel. This is unacceptable. Also On top of this. I was told you guys price match. There was a deal online that was $20 cheaper than the right here and they said they could not do it. So even more annoyed right now that I came here because I thought I was getting a deal. After having heart issues with my bank it took a little longer than necessary which is totally my fault. My car got blocked because were out of town. I would have paid the extra money to stay in a clean hotel but after carrying all of her bags and everything up for four people, me and my husband have to work tomorrow. And both of our kids are ready for bed. None of us will be showering in the bathroom and we are all disgusted to the point we don’t want to get off our beds u less we have our shoes on.
Livid to say the least. The cleaning lady left a envelope for a tip???? She has to be joking. She needs to be fired. Oh!!! and the what class that my daughter went to use had a big black hair in it. Look close at pics! Gross!!!!

Staff is very friendly. I will say. They were nice. Although a guy followed us up to make sure the second room was clean. It wasn’t.. and he walked away and did nothing. I am convinced all rooms are this dirty or I would ask for another!",Wyndham Garden Cross Lanes Charleston,,"This roadside hotel next to I-64 is a 12-mile drive from Downtown Charleston and 3.5 miles from the West Virginia State University.

3.0,2022-11-07T11:29:27,Jacqueline Hartman,"We stopped at a quick one night stop to get some sleep, shower, and back get on the road. It was on the way to where we were headed, so it worked perfectly. Things that need improvement: 1. The thermostat. It was not accurate and as you can see my thermostat said it was 65% humidity, because theirs wasn’t working and wouldn’t trigger air on its own. My husband continued to smell mildew every time he walked into the room, I must have missed it the 2 times I walked in. 2. The vent, it could use some cleaning. I am not sure how clean the air we manually forced out of it was.
Good things on why I scored it high: 1. Price was great. 2. Location for us was awesome. 3. It did the job provide a nice firm mattress for us to get some good shut eye. The pillows could have been comfier, but for the price I will not complain! 4. The one person we interacted with at the desk was great. 5. Had a pool, we didn’t use it but I heard kids were enjoying it when I was checking in. 6. Overall thought things were relatively clean! 7. The bathroom was super cute and had a cool mirror/light. 8. There was a tv, but we didn’t use it. It was small for some standards, but I didn’t care as we were actually just using it for sleep.

If you are looking for a quick stop to get some good sleep and this is on the way, would 100% recommend.

2.0,2022-08-12T23:21:45,Ulyana K,"Not a great experience overall. The only redeeming factors about the hotel are the price and the friendly employees. I stayed here while doing business in the area. I figured that swimming in one of 2 pools would be a great way to relax afterwards, especially for the price. Well, it could have definitely been better.

The first thing I noticed about the hotel is the smell of marijuana in the elevator. Then, when I got up to the hotel room, I tried to get in with the key cards they gave me. It took me no less than 10 tries to successfully use this card. I swiped it almost the same way 10 times, and it magically opened on the 10th.

The room itself was somewhat chilly when I got in. I changed the temperature and it started to heat up quickly. But, there was another odd burnt smell coming from the conditioner. It was dirty, too. Breakfast was decent. Food was nothing special, but the guy serving breakfast was awesome. Very friendly, even though I just had some coffee he offered me some freshly cooked food.

The pools were nice. Not too many people at night or during the day. Expect it to be more crowded at 9 pm than at 11 am, though. There were loads of what seemed to be pool algae all around the pool (dark green in color) but the water itself was clean. Good ambiance with the rocks and faux plants. Not too cold or too warm. Decent fitness center, too. Treadmill worked fine, they had dumbbells and a few other strength training machines. Pretty basic and small.

It's a bit tough to sleep during the night. They didn't give any pillows or blankets for the 2nd room with the pull out bed. You can hear everything and I was a bit concerned about a door near my room. People walking in and out all the time and you will surely hear some of that.

All in all, if you want a cheap hotel with 2 pools, this may be the place. The location is pretty convenient and the employees were very friendly.

Drove there arriving about an hour later, booked room, went to room and changed clothes. We go down to the pool and nephew starts swimming in the pool (there's a women and child there as well.) There's a sign around hot tub saying it's closed so we go ask what the deal is since that was a deciding factor of where we stayed since the nephew was with us. The guy gets kinda rude and says the pool is closed too, but nobody seems to know why. He goes to the pool and puts makeshift sign on the door and tells everyone they need to leave. We go to room, change back into regular clothes, and head downstairs. Upon speaking to the manager apparently the pool is fine but hot tub has a leaking pipe (not what sign says) so it'll remain closed. I'm giving 2 stars rather than 1 because the refund process was pretty seamless. The place looks nice, but being told everything is good, driving almost an hour and checking in to realize it's not, then the lack of communication and poor attitude of the desk worker... ehhh.

Plenty of lounge seating and common space in lobby since they kept the check-in area/front desk small and minimal to make way for more room for amenities. Very nice patio and firepit with views of downtown KC. Decent saltwater pool and hot tub. Asked for corner room since they generally have more space, they were nice enough to oblige upon checkin. Very friendly helpful staff. On the smaller side, family-friendly and near nicer lifestyle shopping centers with dining. The only gripes I had were that walls and floors were very thin and I could hear every footstep and stomps of the family above me at all hours, and every toilet flush. Note that they don't have microwaves in the room (not even for extra deposit) which is understandable and fine for a higher-end hotel, but this was more budget-friendly and family friendly and sometimes that is a godsend if you are traveling with kids.",Courtyard by Marriott Kansas City at Briarcliff,,"Connected to The View at Briarcliff Event Space, this modern hotel is 6 miles from the Sprint Center and 7 miles from the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.

2.0,2019-05-20T17:10:11,Jordan P,"The waitress was great, and some of the food seemed really interesting considering we didn't intend on coming here but the place we were meaning to go to was closed. The place in dingy, so be prepared for that; the sign is in disrepair, badly needs paint, the patio section desperately needs to be remodeled, broken down cars out front (as well as a broken down boat). Now, as to the food: pretty good. I got the Rancocas Burger and was generally pretty impressed other than it being overcooked (ordered medium, came out well.

5.0,2019-04-29T16:45:51,Matthew Charles,"A very special thank you to Reed F and Christian G. They made my stay enjoyable and were extremely accommodating and helpful given such short notice. Beautiful room, with a great view, along with plenty of amenities that make this a very desirable destination choice. They have a spa, golfing course within walking distance, a tram that runs every 20-30 minutes to nearby restaurants and outlet, and is situated in a gated community with security. However, I am extremely disappointed in the manner in which I was charged a $75 late fee checkout from Dawn Lucas. I am an Hilton Honors member and my room was without any heat the entire night. No one checked on the room, despite several inquires. I was freezing and slept for only a few hours. I asked for a late checkout to rest and have never had a problem with late checkouts before, even when hotels are at full occupancy. It wasn't so much the charge that bothered me but rather the manner and attitude I received regarding it. It was unprofessional and came across as extremely rude. Dawn almost seemed to take delight in charging the late fee, something that I felt extremely off putting. For those who see these, I caution you to be aware of their late checkout policies, especially if you are a Hilton Honors member, because I am now less hesitant to book my stay there again.

4.0,2019-06-16T22:37:24,KL Dice,"We had mixed feelings about our stay at this Hilton.  First off, the pictures of the family suites are deceiving.   We thought their would be an extra room with a king or two doubles.  Their was not.  It's all one big room.  When you walk in their are bunk beds, (the ceiling was low and the ladder was steep) then a hallway, bathroom ( with no lock on it, by the way) then the bed with a table & sofa ( that turns into a bed) then balcony.   They do have multiple restaurants, but  all of them were pricey.  They did give us a free ice cream, it was pretty good.  Alex who checked us in was very helpful.

They have multiple pools, but if you dont get  out to the lounge chairs by seven your out of luck!  Beachfront was great!  You have to rent chairs & umbrellas for the beach, so we just brought our own.  The hot tub in the indoor pool jets did not work.

Overall we enjoyed our stay.

It wasn't until our second trip to the front desk that we were told we could use the spa, how the bands work and towel checkout, where was breakfast and where we could eat.

3.0,2022-08-23T12:05:58,Ameer Robinson,So this place overall gets three stars because even though the service was exemplary inside the service outside with subpar and left nothing to be desired and ultimately they have the judged on the entire experience so that's why it's getting three stars. CRoom was awesome. Pool was awesome again. Service desk concierge all awesome but the beach service simply stated sucks.  The customer service skills are lacking.  Maybe it's because they just get paid on tips. Who knows. We bought a total of three umbrellas with chairs and didn't have a server come to us until we were about to leave and ask us if we wanted anything as we were actively packing up.  We stayed a little bit longer after we checked out and one person in a group needed Wi-Fi and understanding that we were still spending money with the hotel. Nobody made an extra move to try to even accommodate the request.  Would I stay here again? Big maybe... Would we spend as much as we did on incidental things??

4.0,2022-08-14T20:13:54,Kenton Wiedenbeck,"This place is ""Starting"" to grow on me. Much better atmosphere than my visit back in November 2021. Masks are encouraged but not Forced on you. The Food court has gotten back into it's groove and the options are plentiful and given a 4 Day 3 night stay we had tried just about everything with no complaints. The main Restaurant was superb, my Steak couldn't have been cooked any better and exactly as I requested. Medium with no seasoning only salt and hint of cracked pepper. This place still has plenty of real table games(it's nice have a real human for a dealer). They still have a mix of virtual table machines but the balance was much better than a lot of other out of the way casino resorts are going. Great selection of slots but still like all the other casinos, they are very tight. The areas for those not able to gamble was open and they had plenty to do to keep them busy. I recommend you check out their website to see all the options and entrainment available to anyone traveling with young people. I seen quite a few on this trip and they seemed quite happy and talkative. In all, we enjoyed this visit but I still miss my Wisconsin favorites. However, this one will definitely grow on you. Enjoy and definitely Good Luck! You'll need it, Lol.
Update 8-14-22; I just spent two nights here and this place just keeps getting better. Slots seem to be a little less tight and I actually walked out ahead this time, significantly 😁. I noticed a lot more staff, slot attendants doing hand pays, Security, cleaning personal and the drink servers we're around checking up on everyone very regularly. I still have to get used to the higher drink prices (""We're not in Wisconsin anymore""😂). The area is Beautiful and lots to do if you need a break and you're not in the gambling mood. If only they had a Spa this would definitely be a 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Resort.

The room itself was a little sketchy with something growing on the wall, the ceiling was pealing in the corner and was breaking away along the exterior wall. The tub had serious rust stains, and the phone didn't work. That's relevant because I needed to call the front desk when I woke up and found that my car had been broken into.

I had to call on my phone and the front desk just asked what room I was in. They didn't even apologize that this crime had been committed, didn't offer to send someone to clean up the glass, call the cops, anything. And when I checked out they didn't say anything. I received more sympathy from the cops (just filed a report, they didn't send anyone out) and the glass repair company Safelite. They apologized that this had happened and helped me find a repair location that can get me in tomorrow in a different state. Quality Inn isn't quality at all.

This resort charges a $25 resort fee in addition to $25 per day to self park across the street or $35 valet.  This Labor Day weekend seems to have overwhelmed the check in staff as there was a line of 50+ cars trying to check in and 50+ people on Friday evening.  Room smelled musty. Shower hardly drained.  Exactly one coffee cup provided and phone to call front desk or guest services didn’t work. Low def TV. However, Location is great although there are many homeless people and panhandlers in the area.

1.0,2020-03-29T15:16:01,Nancy Sepulveda,So incredibly disappointed.. I use to love the Hilton Daytona oceanfront property but this stay was definitely disappointing. The young lady who checked us in for our stay was very pleasant and as a Hilton honors member they upgraded our room from ocean view to ocean front. After arriving in the room I went to use the restroom and noticed the bathroom hadn’t been cleaned. During these times with many uncertainties this was very concerning. I searched our room after noticing the bathroom wasn’t clean and found a bug shell on our bed! We called the front and the quickly moved us to a different room . No bug shells on this bed but the room was still very sad and the pictures on the wall even had broken glass in the frame. I talked so highly of this property and after this stay I am embarrassed of how highly I spoke of it . I also paid $20 for self parking and when I mentioned the gate was up and not closing they said valet was working on it only to wake up this am and it still be open .,Hilton Daytona Beach Oceanfront Resort,,"This modern beachside hotel is a minute's walk from the Ocean Center convention facility and a 2-minute walk from the Daytona Lagoon waterpark.

Bowling is expensive so are the rides. Bumper cars were 6 for example.  Great for dates maybe but if you have a lot of kids skip this place try spare time down the street.

1.0,2021-10-08T02:04:35,Andrew Davenport,"This post should have been made in March 2021 but the trauma of the night is still a struggle for me.

I had been here once before and had a decent time. We paid extra for VIP and side lot parking. This night that lot was full and we parked on a side lot that was “monitored / guarded.” We got there and did not do a VIP experience as we had time to kill. It felt like the line did not move and easily an hour after standing in line we made it to the front of the building. We were 4 or 5 groups back and the line completely stopped. Across from us was the VIP line for the front door and they were not permitted to enter either. Several people from both lines would knock and ask questions but were disrespected.

Visitors had purchased tickets online and did not wish to continue to wait. They knocked to see if they could get a date adjustment and still the doors would be slammed in their face. There wasn’t a special uniform for the workers so when people knocked some would be allowed entry but no one updated the crowd outside. Eventually after a 2 hour wait (from arrival) the security guard shared they were short staffed and had to allow some people to clear out. There was no apology or anything just blatant disrespect to paying customers.

When we arrived and paid to park in the trap museum lot it was early evening and the lot was lit up by sunlight. By the time we finished the museum we came out to night time. The lot we paid to park in was not well lit when we returned to my vehicle. I found my vehicle damaged, articles stolen and when I asked the attendant he radioed a manager as he was too busy and didn’t know anything happened.

We spoke with the representative or manager who went by the name A1. He did not provide his full name but assured us they would fix my window. This time of evening we could not get anyone out and due to Covid mobile window repairs were limited. Still A1 shared the museum would cover the costs. The police came and took a report along with dusting for fingerprints. The thieves not only broke my window they damaged my glove compartment that had my Glock locked inside of it. They stole work items to include files, electronics and my work laptop. The serial numbers of all of my items were added to the police report.

I am a business owner and could not work for a month as I had to work to replace the electronics, files and missed opportunities to make money as I did not have the tools. I shared this with A1 and a lady named Adlia along with sharing the price point for replacing my window. I submitted all of my receipts for my window, loss work and equipment in hopes they would replace my work electronics as a thank you to a military veteran. It was wishful thinking but they mentioned they were short staffed, they pretended to understand how this interrupted my night and work as well.

They offered to cashapp me $300 for my window and a we are sorry that happened. Window itself was $300 and that did not include emergency installation. This place gave me a real life experience of what it means to support the trap.

5.0,2022-02-20T03:34:23,Victor N,"This was a great experience! We did the Sporting KC room with 5 adults plus a 5-year old and loved it! No spoilers, so all I'll say is don't let the small room deceive you. Plenty of clever things to discover.

They will give as many hints as you would like. Only the first requested 3 hints are free though. Anything beyond those 3 result in a 3-minute penalty each. You still get a full hour to break out, no matter how many hints you use. You're time will just look longer than one hour. This is how people get scores of 64 minutes, even though you only have an hour max.

The do give free hints if they see that you're stuck. These do not count against your 3 free requested hints, nor do they penalize your time.

My advice for the uninitiated is to not be afraid to use the hints! Especially if you're not going to try again at a later date. Enjoy the puzzles, but don't let them frustrate you. Make sure someone is keeping track of time so that you can pace the free hints.

A little over a month later I’ve already gone through most of the rooms available, with plans to then move to the other location and start tackling the rooms available there as well. The amount of work that must have gone in to these rooms baffles me. There are some puzzles that, when solved, result in things to happen in the room that I’m not sure whether is through the work of intricate wiring or the diligence of the room attendant person. Speaking of room attendant person, I’ve had my party overseen by Alex most of the times I’ve been there and he is a treasure. Super helpful and personable, and so quick to observe when we’ve done something slightly wrong to nudge us a tad and tell us to hey maybe try that thing again. Of course his nudges are always warranted and never ruin any puzzle or sense of achievement we feel when we hear the lock click. He’s also very quick to deliver clues when we do ask for them, and the clues are always exactly what we need.

You are not allowed to bring in your own cooking items or even a hotplate. I could probably fit one can of chunky soup into three of the paper bowls provided. fridge size is what you would expect in a dorm room. previous reviews mention coupons everyday to the restaurant at the casino, I was not informed of this upon checking in and was never offered a coupon my whole stay. I stayed almost a full week before I caved and had my boss switch me hotels... I will never be back!!

I am surprise that the carpet still broken from the hall way (trip hazard) and beds have holes as it is a Holiday Inn Chain should be better for the price they charge. The pillows smells like sweaty head from the previous person. Really this hotel needs to improve. When I was sleeping i had bugs over me around 6 of them and another ones at the floor. Check the pictures. The staff told me it were from the outside bugs and they were aware of that and of course move me to another room. When I asked to extended my checked out I was only allow 30 min.

My non-smoking room was on the third floor, was in good condition and didn't smell. However, the elevator and the entire 3rd floor smelled like cigarette smoke. The closet was tiny, but there were plenty of drawers in the dresser.

The room had plenty of room to walk around in and for a couple of people to sit comfortably. I had a king size bed and it was very comfortable.

Breakfast was alright. I had sausage patties, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy and a waffle with coffee and oj. Coffee tasted like flavored water. They also had apple juice, toast, bagels, cereal and oatmeal.

When my husband and I stayed, we found brown spots on the unwashed sheets and pillowcases, stained flooring, dirty walls, broken door and window locks, many patched holes in the wall, and a broken phone and picture frame.  We have stayed in hotels in third world countries that were cleaner and more kept up.  It took 45 minutes for them to switch us to a new room, where we discovered a crust spot on the bed cover.  Instead of an apology, the owner stated ""Well, I asked the housekeeper to check it for me.""  They brought a new bed cover after another 20 minutes.  We did not feel comfortable there not knowing if they even changed the sheets.  Instead of relaxing, we had to leave shortly after for our concert.  After we complained in the morning, the front desk lady asked us ""What kind of crust spot was it?"" in lieu of an apology.  I asked her how we were to know and why it mattered.  She then offered $10 off, which was not worthy of accepting.  The owner did not offer anything else and obviously does not take pride in her business.

1.0,2018-11-29T14:45:27,Chocolat- e,Not good at all. Staff all nice yes but the condition of the hotel overall not ok. The cleanliness was poor. Some rooms are unfinished. Some smell like urine. Very drafty during the winter. Breakfast was trash. And there are bed bugs and bettles present in some areas and rooms this was the BIGGEST DISGUST AND TURN OFF. I do not have bugs of any type in my home and NEVER have much less in my bed so with that being said I will not sell myself short in someone else's establishment that's meant to make others feel comfortable.  I was un easy the remainder of my stay and had to do alot of mental conditioning to get past what i seen even after switching rooms... I'm a super visual person and once i see something its difficult to un see. I will not be back and wish like hell I could atleast get half of my money back for the major inconvenience. For this to not have been discovered tells me someone is not doing their job or fair share here. Thanks but no thanks Days Inn. When I visit it's for weeks to a month at a time so I take my booking seriously for the safety and comfort of my family above all else. This was unacceptable. And it was kinda just brushed over as if this was a normal complaint.

Upon entering, we were immediately hit with a strong mold smell. Our room A/C unit was also set at 60. We turned it to heat and began suffocating from an enveloping odor of mold/mildew. Everything--carpet and sheets, felt damp. We asked to move but were told all rooms were taken. Suspecting water damage, I found peeling wallpaper near the floor and doors in the hallway. Inspecting the room, ceiling paint was cracking, falling away, and stained with water rings. The walls are weak and give under pressure near the floor under the window. Metal fixings (hinges, pipes, hangers...) are rusted. There are cobwebs in the corners, and plenty of pubic hairs on the bathroom floor. The door sign with the room prices is yellowed, smudged (mildew?), and has hair hanging from it. The free wifi had 1 bar at best and really never stayed connected throughout our stay.

3.0,2021-06-28T16:48:09,Ben P,"Pros: some fun stuff for kids! Go karts, bumper boats, rock climb, trampoline jump. There are also laser tag and mini golf available. There is a game room with some arcade style games, snacks, etc. Kids will love everything here, and you might too.

Cons: EXPENSIVE! Understand before you go that tickets for just outside activities are $30 per person... For 2 hours. That's $120 for a family of 4. Want to play a doubt of mini golf? That's not included... That's another $18... Per person. So now you're up to $200. Wanna try laser tag?it's very fun, but also not included.

Your kids will want to play the arcade games to win tickets, you can buy game passes for a time limit.

During fully open operation and during the summer it is *crowded* so lines are long so be prepared to wait.

Bottom line - kids will have a blast, go on off-peak days if you can, look online or ask about packages for activities and games, and be prepared to shell out a lot of money for the afternoon; if you're not ready to either drop a couple hundred bucks or disappoint the kids by telling them ""no"" then maybe come back a different time.",Hinkle Fun Center,,"Family recreation spot featuring bumper cars, laser tag, paintball & more along with an arcade.",,4.4,11.0,True,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaEppWGpBRRAB,Amusement center,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCltabjNCyLvbb3_9NILsQYFXghdXfJlUSJLfw=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuzGWmvQohHP8cPa4yYabmBAQNflVbvLqFtbX4=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaEppWGpBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x412edc9effd42a9e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDqhJiXjAE%7CCgwIyfrnhgYQsMbajQE%7C?hl=en-US,107238146596747514590,93.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5QfMXh1ck3MWoxsiJnLCWk2U3XBnUejCRT3VvVZgQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107238146596747514590?hl=en-US,2249,2023-03-26T11:04:01.183Z,New Mexico,12931 Indian School Rd NE,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hinkle+Fun+Center/@35.0821683,-106.8165631,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8718a04616bd7ba3:0x412edc9effd42a9e!8m2!3d35.0955452!4d-106.4982381!16s%2Fg%2F1tyt5tdn?hl=en",https://www.hinklefuncenter.com/,Amusement center,,,Amusement center,activity,"[('cons', 0.448), ('pros', 0.3603), ('arcade', 0.2601), ('fun', 0.2242), ('activities', 0.218)]","['cons', 'pros', 'arcade', 'fun', 'activities']","[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4339221715927124}]",,real,ChIJo3u9FkagGIcRnirU_57cLkE,207

Nothing huge but worth mentioning.  The private beach is directly behind the hotel and easy to get back and forth. Multiple places to eat and all were on par with the resort.  Several other upscale amenities, activities and services are available consistent with other Hilton resorts. Another bonus is they provide shuttle service to Baytown Wharf which is close to the resort, among other places.

We have been together for 4 and a half years and now engaged and have a beautiful 9 month old baby girl. At this place I met friends and made family the connections you make just by visiting this place are amazing even if it is just to watch a movie because the employees are always happy the theaters are always clean and you are guaranteed to make memories so don’t forget to capture them.😌,Cinemark 20 and XD,,"Chain of movie theaters, some with multiple screens, stadium seats & self-service ticketing kiosks.",,4.4,12.0,True,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxeHEteHpnRRAB,Movie theater,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOH54W83rRC3WUrW93lRmF90DXVwo7U7tAFVDer=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNY4fo7xlJzqIRZlusj0PKdK9p-JOU84fO0VFPr=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNchT4GPPisR1NgPNF82zPy7T2JCMbM_XquQo7z=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMETssFybkU2zCPeYucxzk0kt70jrEAqEhnbbDh=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuhnSfUk8gF-grBdEeyaZYRfjH-SiSXxKyuVpo=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7VS7Hu1EWow1VdwjnW8r5epPwhQ6pnrgU02Pa=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFfHsX8f8o9enDWRCEFtvOFTMzoEE3YCWOdqfy=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPA4Js_JaBz4WpZiepIvGqItdF8batdktZPAaTx=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPutwkZ_N0quWkIrLw2zTDebMKwZm7fK7VUf5h=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTrYfmlOpYvFiQYmyUmcQMUqZfJ1ixRnhKdWA0=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxeHEteHpnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x3a2ef4996d777502!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDqxq-xzgE%7CCgwI1p2UhwYQkITV0gM%7C?hl=en-US,105630764307482087811,103.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SkKXWbvFD0qKx12aS1bpcdHqdsLj7rucMadCgabQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105630764307482087811?hl=en-US,3954,2023-03-26T11:01:01.874Z,Kansas,5500 Antioch Dr,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Cinemark+20+and+XD/@39.0236396,-94.753853,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x87a17ea7f88622a3:0x3a2ef4996d777502!8m2!3d39.0290037!4d-94.6879504!16s%2Fg%2F11b708kjw8?hl=en",https://www.cinemark.com/theatres/ks-merriam/cinemark-20-and-xd?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=gmb&utm_campaign=local_listing_theater&utm_content=GMB_listing&y_source=1_MTc0OTMxNDYtNzE1LWxvY2F0aW9uLndlYnNpdGU%3D,Movie theater,Snack bar,,Movie theater,activity,"[('theaters', 0.3763), ('theater', 0.3356), ('place', 0.2951), ('visiting', 0.2924), ('employees', 0.2243)]","['theaters', 'theater', 'place', 'visiting', 'employees']","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6120910048484802}]",,real,ChIJoyKG-Kd-oYcRAnV3bZn0Ljo,126

My date and I went to J. Alexander's for a quick workday lunch. It took a while to be seated (no complaints, because it was the lunch rush) and the table service made up for it because our server was prompt and efficient. We both wanted something light and landed on the same thing: the Thai Kai Salad ($16) with chicken, mixed greens, and peanuts tossed in a cilantro vinaigrette with Thai peanut sauce, along with a croissant on the side. It was a great salad and we both enjoyed it because the dressing was flavorful and tangy, had nice pieces of cold-yet-grilled chicken, and we left feeling full. I'm not sure if it was worth $16, but I can't say for certain it was not. One great thing about this salad was we were both productive at work and didn't feel sluggish.",J.

Also, unlike most other restaurants we have visited on NYE they didn’t give us a set amount of time before running is out. Instead, they let us sit at our table and enjoy our date night together.

1.0,2018-10-02T12:36:21,Ash C,"1 star for a subpar/gross experience at Chicago Getaway Hostel. I rented a private room for 3 nights looking for a clean/decent place to sleep and shower while I was in the city for a work project. Chicago Getaway Hostel did not fit the bill.

The Hostel is in a beautiful Lincoln Park neighborhood with tons of giant trees and you really can't find a better location to get the LP vibe but then walk a block to hop on trains/buses. The cost for a private room is comparable to a hotel room, but I chose this place because it's location was within walking distance to where I was going to be working. After looking at reviews and photos of the hostel, it seemed like a very modern and clean place that I would be comfortable staying at... unfortunately the photos were deceiving and the reviews did not represent my experience.

When I walked up to the building, I had to walk through a crowd of people gathering on the sidewalk outside the hostel smoking (great for my asthma) to enter the building. This happened every time I entered/exited the building over the next few days, which was a real turn off to me. The check in process was quick - the person checking me in rushed through all of the instructions and gave me no written document that verified what he went over, so that was fun.

My room looked nice at first glance - 2 bunk beds, a desk, shower/toilet/sink. All the essentials. Upon further investigation here's what I found (some photos attached)... the bathroom was absolutely disgusting. I don't know when it was last cleaned, but it had to have been a long time. The amount of dirt/grime built up in that shower made me feel dirtier than I was when I walked in. One shouldn't have to buy flip flops to shower in a private room bathroom they rented. There was buildup ON THE SHOWER HEAD where the clean water is supposed to come out of but there was nastiness caked on so it passed through that first.

The beds were pretty uncomfortable. The mattress was very thin and I could feel the bars through it, so it was rough sleeping. A majority of the linens had a ton of stains/loose hairs on them (especially the pillows) and they were very rough in texture. All of this combined made me feel very gross and like the room hadn't been cleaned at all. For the price of a hotel room I'd expect a much higher level of cleanliness from this place.

Needless to say, I will not be back.",Chicago Getaway Hostel,,"Vibrant, modern hostel with dormitory & private rooms, plus a guest kitchen, free breakfast & WiFi.",1-star hotel,4.1,0.0,True,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBX0pyaTNnRRAB,Hostel,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVHBocKpYgIfkuqQocbpequ1nmlV_aHoNMgctm=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGBZ4KoSDjWafS2AP9umOC-Qa5WC4QtakyClYi=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCgVIkgklQss-62dfcA-J6L5MNxOrWbyv4jBO3=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtt-HTpcJ5g0WuvVyCS95oLGj-knaK2pkqL1XJ=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBX0pyaTNnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xe7048c084e9305f!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICA_Jri3gE%7CCgwIxczN3QUQqO_NugM%7C?hl=en-US,104433012677603482894,60.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5QCvkQfOxKksKcyUrOK8_ra32a9EwsDeIlR_euFvg=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104433012677603482894?hl=en-US,1980,2023-03-26T11:27:46.614Z,Illinois,616 W Arlington Pl,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Chicago+Getaway+Hostel/@41.9268713,-87.6796144,14z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x880fd30e41afb9ab:0xe7048c084e9305f!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d41.9268713!4d-87.6445955!16s%2Fg%2F1tg2l7zx?hl=en",http://www.getawayhostel.com/,Hostel,Extended stay hotel,Guest house,Hostel,hotel,"[('hostel', 0.4692), ('hotel', 0.411), ('cleanliness', 0.3681), ('clean', 0.3169), ('room', 0.3168)]","['hostel', 'hotel', 'cleanliness', 'clean', 'room']",,,real,ChIJq7mvQQ7TD4gRXzDphMBIcA4,442

5.0,2016-08-24T00:13:34,Angela S,"I visited Chicago for a Pearl Jam concert & stayed here for 3 nights. I loved the experience. This was my first stay in a Hostel, & I was nervous at first, but that quickly changed when I sat in the common area & chatted with people from all over the world. Everyone was so friendly, & I met several PJ fans.
The price was very affordable & they had everything I needed + some. If you don't mind sharing a room, this is a great place to stay.
The hotel staff was very friendly & helpful, & let you store your bags if you arrive before check-in.
I shared a room with 6 other females (8 bed room). Bunk beds come with sheets, 1 pillow, 1 thick blanket, 1 locker, & 1 towel. You will need to bring a lock for the locker, or you can purchase one for $5.40 at the front desk. There is an ac window unit & a portable heater in each room.
Women's bathroom had 3 stalls & 3 showers with a hair dryer & several shared shower products that are removed on Mondays.
There are about half a dozen computers, a printer (free), lots of space to sit & lounge, pool & Foosball table, 2 televisions with plenty of seats, & a very nice patio area with bicycle rentals.
There is also a big kitchen you can use any time, huge eating area, 3 refrigerators, 1 freezer, bins & labels to store your food, plenty of shelves to store dry food, ice machine, vending machines, & Kuerig with coffee & hot chocolate. There is an onsite laundry room with laundry soap & fabric softener available for purchase as well.
I hope this helps!!

2.0,2021-11-28T03:04:13,Kassi L,"Minutes after we walked into our room, I started having severe dust allergies, and the place was filthy. I was shocked because we expect so much more from a Marriott. I called and asked for the room to be cleaned while we were gone for a few hours, telling them that the floor was really dirty and the phone had so much dust on it it appeared it hadn't been cleaned in a very long time (just to give them some examples of the problems.) When we came back, it was clear someone had wiped down the phone briefly and swept the tile floor in the doorway, but the room was still filthy. I called again and let them know, and to their credit, they upgraded us to a much nicer much cleaner room. And I wasn't allergic to this room which was visibly less dusty and dirty.
We were thankful for the upgrade, but it should have never been necessary. I shouldn't walk into a room in a Marriott property to find it so dirty.

When we got in the room we noticed there was a cabinet for a refrigerator, but no refrigerator. I called the desk and was asked if I requested one. I told her no, that I didn't think I had to since EVERY hotel I've stayed in for the last 25 or more years had one in the room. I take prescription medication that must be refrigerated. I explained that to her. She said she would notify housekeeping. Several hours later I went to the desk and asked again, stressing my need for a refrigerator, again explaining my situation. We stayed for 2 nights and never got a refrigerator. I guess i should be grateful there was an ice bucket. Hopefully it didn't compromise the effectiveness of my prescription.
In addition, there was no microwave.
When we returned to our room the housekeeper was at the end of the hall.
There was a pile of dirty towels outside our room. We went out and when we returned hours later the housekeeper was gone but the pile of towels were still there. My husband called the desk to tell them they forgot to pick them up, they thanked him and assured him it will be taken care of. They were still there this morning when we left.

This facility far exceeded my expectations. The dressing rooms and facility itself was clean and updated. It was $35 for all three of us (out of city residents) to swim/play all day which isn't even one ticket at other water parks. We have been to our fair share of water parks, splash pads, etc. and I have never experienced lifeguards and staff remain so continuously attentive and alert in their positions. Not once did I see a lifeguard distracted by their cell phones, talking to each other, nothing of the sort. I noticed the staff rotated positions frequently, took safety checks in their zones, and were quick to act in situations to prevent accidents or injury. As a parent, I value and appreciate these proactive practices so much.

I have to make a separate paragraph for the dessert. Nikki did a fantastic job. It's a peanut butter custard with brownie cubes and buttered pecans.

Our waiter did a great job taking care of us and giving recommendations. We started with appetizers of meatballs, Pear Bruschetta and Salmon Crudo. It was a great way to start off our meal. For entrees we had Rigatoni Bolognese, Tuscan Chicken and Salmon. We shared bites and I would order any of  the other items next time I come here. I enjoyed the hand made pasta and you could tell they paid attention to details. The dessert was Tiramisu and it was ok, nothing special. Their wine and beer selection is decent. Overall, a great dinner and I recommend  to come with some friends and the night will be memorable.

4.0,2022-06-18T20:04:55,Kim Taylor,"I'm visiting here from Delaware, and I wasn't sure what to expect since the existing reviews are nowhere near consistent. I booked the hotel room through Agoda based solely on the fact that it was a very short (and safe) walk to Oven's Auditorium where my granddaughter's graduation from Hawthorne Academy was scheduled to take place. Overall, I am happy with the room. While it's far from the best place I've ever stayed, and the main elevator has been out of order the entire time I've been here, it has still been an enjoyable stay. The two photos that accompany my review are my photos taken with my Moto phone, not stock photos. My room was very clean upon my arrival. While the furniture was a little dated with a scuff here and there, everything was functional. A little Old English Scratch Cover would definitely make a huge difference in the existing furniture. That said, would I stay here again? Absolutely. The staff was very friendly. They offered me the use of their service elevator to go back and forth to my third floor room, which I thought was really nice since I'm almost 67 years old, and I don't particularly like flights of stairs. The only real disappointment was the fact that the hotel restaurant was permanently closed. Perhaps it was a victim of Covid. I'm not sure. There is a circa 1955 burger establishment almost directly across the highway, but you cannot walk there unless you want to take your life in your hands crossing the very busy highway. I wouldn't try it even if I were Usain Bolt in his prime. But I did drive there, and it only took me about 5 minutes using Google Go directions. (Their Ribeye sandwich was the best I've ever eaten.)  So yeah, I would definitely stay here again. It is ranked as a 3-star hotel, and I give it 4 stars myself because I felt very safe here, and they went out of their way to accommodate me. I will say that if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. Like any other hotel or motel on a busy highway, there is traffic noise at night. The sound of the running AC unit helps, but the foam earplugs really shut it out. ⭐⭐⭐⭐",Golden Green Hotel Daily & Extended Stay - Loving Hut Vegan Restaurant,,"Set off Route 74 and Highway 27, this modest hotel is a block from Bojangles Coliseum and 4.4 miles from Bank of America Stadium.

First I was told when I booked I can have a early check in with a confirmation that it would not be a problem. I get there and I'm told I can't check in until 3. Why not contact me ahead of time so I could made arrangements at the another hotel. I had to be in lake norman by 3 which is why the early check in was needed. They only had a double available and charged me $10 extra didn't even offer the same price due to the inconvenience. SMH. On top of that the elevator didn't work and my room was on the 6th floor. Complete bs. And the room..omg look at the pics. Pub hair on the folded towel. So you know what that means 🤮 the only decent thing was the TV they need to revamp that hotel by the pics you see it needs a major major upgrade.  The area wasn't bad.

5.0,2020-12-26T17:42:50,Kimberly Kayona,"The Pros: I checked in at night, and desk attendant was very efficient, going above and beyond for service with a smile. The evening staff was super friendly! Every time I went past the lobby, they greeted me like old friends. When I was in the gift shoppe area, we chatted and laughed. They were super accommodating.

The room was great! The furniture was really cool and unique in the King Studio. The side view room shows the parking garage of the hotel next door, but if you stand on the balcony and look left, you have a great view of the beach. To the right, trees everywhere past the shopping center.

The hotel was really clean everywhere, including the public restrooms by the lobby. The breakfast area has a beautiful view of the Gulf.

My only con: I've just now noticed that at all different Hamptons I've stayed in, they all seem to have really bad pillows. Like, you can ball them up, or drape them over your arm almost like a towel. They go flat as soon as you lay your head down. Now, I just bring a small but firm travel pillow to put under the 2 already on the bed.

I would definitely stay here again!",Hampton Inn & Suites Orange Beach/Gulf Front,,"Off State Route 182, this contemporary beachfront hotel is a 5-minute walk from downtown Orange Beach.

Well tasting the Mahbarawi is the first time that I cried from food being that good. I generally don't trust restaurants that only have five reviews, where all five are four or five stars, and most of them come from reviewers with little to no reviews. Well, I'm glad that I took the risk. For less than $20 I enjoyed one of the best meals of my life, with a lovely cup of tea, and service as good as one could hope for.

It looks like somebody just ate half of it and gave me the left overs… if I am a respectful loyal customer then you guys need to respect your customers too!!!!!! This is very dirty of you guys to treat take out customers like this… to go orders and dine in orders should be the same portion size!!! Because when I dine it I have never received something like this it always a big portion.This happened to me before too by the way I just forgot to write a review.
