4.0,2022-01-29T15:23:32.733Z,Demetris,"1/2022:  RECOMMEND, but 3.5 stars if possible due to 2 details:

If possible, go during the WEEKDAY for Unlimited bowl until 5pm for $11.99. I've hurt my arms & shoulders from bowling way too many games during this inexpensive time and improved my bowling scores.  (Thank you Round 1).

I've enjoyed going to Round 1 to relax and enjoy the oversized Pac-man game and bowl some stress away.  I have not tried the food nor drinks there because I just go in to play games.

Mostly clean, spacious and social distancing  protocols are  in effect.  Team members were constantly cleaning.  My only negative comment is that no one has cleaned the escalator entrance and it looks unwelcoming/unsightly.

I love arcades, and this one blew my mind. A lot of the games are the Japanese versions which is amazing to find, especially in The Land of Enchantment.

I love claw machines(the more challenging the better), and this place has TONS of them.

I purchased a $40 card and after a few arcade tries I went to try a claw.

After about 10 tries my card ran out of money, and I went to go re-load it. While I was gone, the progress that I had made on the item in the machine was re-set by a worker, which led me to a mini-freakout.

Never heard about or used it before but it seemed it had got nice reviews and ratings on several travel websites. The price was also very good, especially compared to those resorts and cabins inside RMNP (Riding Mountain National Park). These are attractive enough so I decided to give it a try.

I have to tell you that I was not disappointed at all even though I  set my expectation very high. This B&B is right out of the town of Onanole, on a small hill right beside Hwy 10. Only 7km from the entrance of RMNP, you have easy and quick access to the park while still enjoy the quiet and beautiful setting of the B&B. The historic building has been beautifully restored and tastefully decorated. The room feels cozy and the bed is comfortable and supportive. The full breakfast (with bacon, egg/omelette, toasts, fruits, and coffee) was delicious. There are lots of other amenities for the gusts to enjoy, like the huge deck, the lounge room with TV, etc. Too bad I stayed for two nights only and was too busy to fully enjoy them.

We enjoyed the back deck immensely and found ourselves out there every night. While we were there the owners, Cindy and Earl began another project on the grounds, preparing an area for wedding ceremonies to be held. I am certain that is going to be a great addition to the property and well received in the area.

The breakfast service was excellent. As someone that loves to cook, I could easily see the passion that went into the morning meal.

The beds are amazingly comfortable and the sheets are out of this world comfortable. The great news is that you can buy the same sheets and bring home a brand new set for yourself.

The space provides an interactive digital entertainment for the whole family, first date, or friends. It can be very fun but I could imagine with a lot of people it could make for a busy experience with lines or frustration attempting to use an exhibit.
Most exhibits are like playing a VR game such as Beat Saber or a VR style Atari Pong while others are interactive or viewable digital art that continuously changes. A very unique experience. I did not try the food or drinks so I cannot speak to their quality or pricing but the main attraction here is the digital environment. Would definitely check out if in the Albuquerque area.

Not only is it a revolving conveyor belt sushi spot (which reminds me of Japan), but it has made to order foods on a self-service kiosk! You also insert your plate in a slot to keep track of your bill and total. You win a little toy prize if you get 15 (probably not worth it, but it's fun!) My only gripe is that this place does not serve very fresh ingredients... the fish quality is mediocre, and I DON'T recommend the Uni on ANY of the rolls. Please don't get it because I had it multiple times, and it definitely should not taste super bitter and rancid. I would not eat here more than once a month. But it is cheap though! $2.75 a plate I believe (for the most part). The Takoyaki octopus balls were amazing.

All plates are made to order, and honestly i think the quality is fresher (you can already tell i loved ordering fresh— see below). The prep time can be longer than just grabbing from the conveyor belt, but for the safety and the freshness, i can take it!!
Menu-wise, i prefer all the belly (toro?) sushi to regular sushi. Their tamago is COLD - didn’t expect that... you should ask for wasabi and soysauce. Udon was decently good - i think better value than miso soup. Oh, i like mackerel as well, but it might be too fishy(?) for some people.

4.0,2018-10-13T22:42:14.917Z,Shant'e T,"I really enjoyed this hotel and glad I selected it for my first trip to LA. It's directly across the street from the train station and surrounded by several bus lines. There's also a really nice church next to it that's worth checking out. I believe it's the Oasis church. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly. The rooms were clean, quiet and the beds comfortable. My first time seeing the Hollywood sign was from my room! Exciting! Commissary, the hotel restaurant was pretty decent. It's aesthetically pleasing giving it an overall good vibe. I even received cilantro seeds in a package along with my bill which was a nice touch. One issue was the kitchen eating area setup. Because the kitchen is in the hotel and the eating area is separated, the staff had to walk outside with my food resulting in pieces from trees on my plate. Also, while there, a pool party was given. During this time I attempted to get a non-alcoholic drink and was told to go outside with the party goers to order a drink or go to another restaurant downstairs in the hotel lobby. I was aware of the pool party in advance and planned to relax by the poolside once it was over. I was unable to do this since the party ended later than the time announced. Besides these few annoyances, I would certainly return to the Line and reccomend it to others.",The LINE LA,,"Adjacent to the Wilshire / Normandie subway station, this hip hotel in a midcentury building in Koreatown is 4 miles from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

1. the latest style of watching TV. No on demand or netflix etc. The connections to attach you device didn't work and didn't have the ability to connect latest Android devices.
2. Noise insulation from outside and noise between rooms. We were women in the middle of the night by noisy neighbours 2 nights. And the Windows are really thin and let on noise and drafts.
3. Service although friendly in general wasn't up to the standard of say a hotel like The Ace.

What was good was:
The room was comfortable.
The view from the room was great of the Hollywood hills.
Cool room design

The only thing, and I mean the ONLY THING, I could comment on was the water pressure is a bit soft. But that’s it.

The pool area is stunning, a nice place to relax and read a book while tanning and having a drink/snack. Good wifi. Haven’t dined in the greenhouse lounge yet but will do so today.

4.0,2022-04-05T03:44:32.388Z,Dean Krapf,"A whole lot to say about our visit.

It was opening day so things were bound to go a bit sideways.

Pros:

Kammi our ref - absolutely amazing! She was attentive to the group, very friendly but had no problem calling out safety items the instant someone's mask wasn't all the way down or an uncovered barrell. She was great and I highly recommend you request her if you are taking a group.

The different games fields were fun and challenging. Our group had seasoned vets and first time adults and teens so it was well balanced. Kammi started us out easy and then introduced respawns and play until you're out of paint which everyone loved.

The field paint quality was really good in my opinion. Very consistent and I wish I had a marker that could really sling it.

The whole staff was friendly and went above and beyond to ensure everyone was safe and having fun.

Cons:

The hiccups of opening day with any business, but the owner and his team took it in stride and powered through.

Ran out of air so they were transporting tanks back and forth. Also ran out of cases of paint but that too was resolved with a trip the their warehouse.  These two items didn't affect our play or the amount of fun we had.

The rental markers were all over the place. Different models, broken detents, etc.  Once again - opening day, but it's on the calendar - clean and check everything weeks in advance. We replaced a few tank o-rings ourselves from our parts kits to save time.

No chronographing of walk on players. The rentals were slow and hot and some walk on teens were definitely pushing 300 fps. That's a safety thing especially with rental masks/lenses and horrible experience for young teens playing for the first time.

I am very glad our group made it down and even with said hiccups we had a blast and will be back in the future.",The Edge Paintball Experience,,,,4.6,2.0,True,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMjd5VVZnEAE,Paintball center,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtFHn_w7ekkZ3pQlTwWf5_sHnttv2167G2xLwT=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPH5nVT8OI9fX8y1t4ddoJLzREWivW9iyLk9Uym=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMjd5VVZnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x1d7c0c9704eb3f0!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDW27yUVg%7CCgwIoPaukgYQwLChuQE%7C?hl=en-US,113737575556195080059,296.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SoolYwEt4KS21sSnH3TMTmR8UCIAQKt8arREpnoA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113737575556195080059?hl=en-US,134,2023-03-26T11:02:50.981Z,Wisconsin,5946 US-51,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/The+Edge+Paintball+Experience/@42.5930271,-90.1429939,9z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x88061e838435d11d:0x1d7c0c9704eb3f0!8m2!3d42.5929872!4d-89.0223799!16s%2Fg%2F12hk1kwtj?hl=en",https://www.608pb.com/,Paintball center,,,Paintball center,activity,"[('cons', 0.3085), ('visit', 0.3083), ('pros', 0.2801), ('fun', 0.2559), ('kits', 0.255)]","['cons', 'visit', 'pros', 'fun', 'kits']","[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.42311805486679077}]",,real,ChIJHdE1hIMeBogR8LNOcMnA1wE

2.0,2022-10-07T21:00:00.970Z,Randy M,"Here’s the good and the bad and the very bad.

The good: The front desk staff who checked us in was very nice, the front office is very nice, and the shower was very nice. Get the picture?

The bad: this is an old motel that needs updating. The carpets are ripped, the sofa is ripped and covered up with a coverlet rather than replacing it, there is a mirror in front of the sofa rather than a TV to look at, and the bed is old and sagging in the middle. And this is an executive suite!Figure that out. Just look at the pictures.

The very bad: we booked a King executive suite. We were told that someone had already taken that suite and extended their stay. Instead of telling them that we had a reservation and that the motel could move them to another room, we were told that we would be moved to another room. We were given a queen executive suite. No discount. No offer of points. Just a “sorry, we can’t guarantee a room.”  When we complained, the manager was quite generous (please note that is sarcasm) by giving  us a whole 500 points. Wow-wee!

The very very bad: And they have the nerve to charge over $200 for the room.

PS The microwave was unplugged and that was because it didn’t work, which I reported to the morning clerk. They don’t serve breakfast in the motel. You have to go next door to the restaurant and the tip is not included. But honestly, we wished we had skipped breakfast because the cook must’ve had a bad morning and most of the food was not cooked enough - runny eggs although ordered fried hard, hash browns hard on one side/soft on the other, the same with the English muffin.

No worries,  it's not like I'm a slob. Went to the housekeeping cart & called out into a room I assumed was being cleaned & nobody answered or was in the room. I put my dirty towels in the bag hanging off the cart & grabbed clean ones & was good to go. No worries.  Put a do not disturb on my door & all was well. My complaint is that there were so many flies in my room when I arrived on the day before. I used a hand towel & killed them all. The a/c filters were filled with lint, like a clothes dryer filter. (The pictures I'm showing here are AFTER I cleaned them). I pulled them out & banged them together outside my door & the lint flew off into the wind. Then I rinsed them off in the shower & dried them & put them back. No worries 👍 sneezing problem solved. Also had to use a hand towl in room 114 to slam in the bottom of the entry door where critters could crawl in from outside.  The insulation on the bottom right corner of the door was missing.  Showerhead had bad water pressure due to corrosion as well & several outlets in the room didn't work. Other than that the place isn't that bad.

I am paranoid about travelling due to the current pandemic, but I didn’t have a worry in the world with how spotless and clean this room was. Felt comfortable, and like home. No dirt, dust bunnies ANYWHERE.

Check in was fast an efficient. This motel could be charging way more than they are for the quality of rooms they provide.

The rooms had pots, pans, dishes, utensils, and whatever else you could need to make yourself a quick meal if you didn’t feel like going out to a nearby restaurant.

The bed was comfy, which is a rare find in most motels. They also has 3 different mattress protectors on the mattress itself, all extremely clean. They provide an additional blanket on top of the shelf as well.

I was also extremely grateful for the working air conditioner, another rare find in motels.

If you are making a cross country drive like I was, I highly recommend planning to stop here for a good nights rest.

(Also I greatly appreciated the little cat feet socks on the chair legs, just adorable.)",Quest Motel,,,,4.7,4.0,True,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4b29EZ093EAE,Motel,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGF5Hja7wiMw_WCXCSMqbLvOwMYqDw_LJQodl1=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2K7bL9eys09Wco5DPmA_4x4Try54WzmQdjGk-=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMYlNcrC1bN1eEVkvXikhEYSiRRQTPwnbt7Nra=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4b29EZ093EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x4fb2d158d60e0e1!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC8ooDgOw%7CCgsIktTi9wUQuJPyEg%7C?hl=en-US,110547249124063660614,34.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5S8BpoE4CZcqLEPe7aR2d1ylovsNd-K-hee3IfX8Q=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110547249124063660614?hl=en-US,209,2023-03-26T11:30:40.830Z,Saskatchewan,913 Service Rd,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Quest+Motel/@49.4677703,-107.8952702,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x52e1a18770802d25:0x4fb2d158d60e0e1!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d50.3355339!4d-102.2634103!16s%2Fg%2F1tcw383_?hl=en",https://instagram.com/questmotel?igshid=ZDdkNTZiNTM=,Motel,,,Motel,hotel,"[('motel', 0.5168), ('motels', 0.4298), ('rooms', 0.3664), ('bed', 0.3278), ('room', 0.3238)]","['motel', 'motels', 'rooms', 'bed', 'room']","[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.38295137882232666}]",,real,ChIJJS2AcIeh4VIR4eBgjRUt-wQ

5.0,2018-07-11T11:39:05.115Z,David Thomas-Jensen,"I have known the proprietor, Mohammed, since he was the head chef at Big Marina on 49th and Central Northeast. He's a good kind and generous father, excellent chef, and you people Uptown are extremely lucky to have this place here end capping eat Street. This place is known for its Mediterranean fare, hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli, Gyros, sambusas, grilled chicken, roast chicken, Kafka, pot roast, BBQ rib tips, arguably some of the best mashed potatoes, three kinds of seasoned rice, countless other dishes. You need to bring an appetite, and expect to overeat if you plan on going with the all-you-can-eat buffet option. A more practical and dietary way, is to make your selections ala carte to go, even if you just sit down and eat. That way you take a measured amount, it controls the overeating, and it's more frugal.

5.0,2022-05-30T16:20:52.530Z,Tom Bandini,"We came to Hilton Head Island for Memorial Day because we never get away for the holidays. It was such a pleasurable experience. The resort was not very busy for being a holiday weekend. There was lots of activities and there is immediate beach access.

The rooms were a little humid even with the air conditioning at 65 which made for some sticky night sleeps but still very cold for the hot weather we experienced.

The food at View 32 was excellent. We highly recommend the Grilled Cheese BLT Panini! I wish they still had the lobster roll from a few years ago when we visited but I was able to find that at a nearby local restaurant. The servers we had were also amazing!

I also had delightful experiences with Clive from the Front Desk and Madison from Guest Services. They had exceptional customer service skills which is the reason I choose Marriott!

We will definitely be visiting again! Thank you to the Westin staff for your hospitality!",The Westin Hilton Head Island Resort & Spa,,"This upscale beachfront resort is 0.5 miles from Port Royal Golf & Racquet Club and 1.3 miles from the Adventure Cove entertainment center.

4.0,2022-10-07T04:14:48.382Z,Mrs. Red Beard,"We were able to book this fun hotel during an “off week”. We spent 2/5 days without leaving. They truly offer everything.

Not long after we checked in, they sent us 2 free app coupons & a bottle of champagne with a thoughtful note for our anniversary.

Our king room was clean & spacious. The bed was SO fluffy, which I loved. We had a partial ocean view which was nice bc that wasn’t what I booked. Most reviews say rooms are outdated, I guess they kind of are but it’s not terrible. Every day we walked past rooms being cleaned, like furniture flipped over & scrubbing. (I’m sure it’s easier for them to do in down time.) I was seriously impressed. The room had complementary water & coffee, a fridge, iron, hair dryer..etc Our only inconvenience was no microwave for leftovers.

All of the staff was so welcoming and kind! Someone said they were short handed, like everywhere, but we didn’t really notice until our last day when a lot more people started coming in. Even then, it wasn’t a problem for us.

The Spa! I wish we would’ve thought to book services sooner. It’s pricey but worth it!

The pools are nice & grounds well manicured. Pools close at 9 which was disappointing. We wanted to use the hot tub at night but couldn’t seem to get there before then.

The walk to the beach is easy with a nice path. We took advantage of the lifeguards umbrella & chair rentals. I believe it was $40 a day. The beach was a little crowded the 2 days we were able to go. I just thought, I couldn’t imagine how busy it would be in the summer.

Last, find the breakfast buffet! They have everything. It was wild. Lol

Overall, we would stay here again if it was in our budget & low crowds. This place is expensive along with every extra thing to go with it. It was our anniversary so we splurged.

So posting the review to show that mistakes can be made and everyone is not scamming for money. I would rather eat my salad than recieve a refund.

5.0,2021-12-18T21:11:51.358Z,Leah Michelle,"We are here last night, December 17th 2021, for my my husband's 28th birthday.

We have lived in Baldwin for 2 years and those years have been pretty rough, we were so lucky to find an apartment in sweet and quiet Baldwin City. We love it here and plan on buying a home. We've experienced quite a few events here but this was our first local restaurant. We were finally able to come to The Wooden Spoke after hearing so much about it and we brought friends from out of town.

What a charming, down-home, relaxed place. The parking lot felt like you were pulling into a old-time drive in, but you get out of your car and reach the door and it feels like you are standing outside of someone's well-loved home. The tables reminded me of my own kitchen tables in my childhood home. I felt comfortable as soon as I sat down. The waitress was extremely attentive, her energy was calm and sincere. Our drink orders were taken immediately, our appetizers came out quickly and the entrees were the best home cooking we all have had in many years.

We ordered the KC strip, the ribeye, the bourban steak and the spoke burger, spoke fries, mash potatoes, the chilli, mozzarella sticks, potato skins, and the wings in this beautiful honey brown sauce that was sweet, spicy, smoky and honestly it was incredible. I love WINGS and these took the trophy from me and my friends!

Our food and plates were hot, the food was fast. All the steaks were cooked as asked, all steaks were medium rare, juicy, delicious and quite big. Burger was done just well and had a classic burger taste.

The alcoholic beverages were delicious and made strong.

My daughter ordered the kids chicken strips and she said they were very good, we loved the fries. The spoke burger was amazing and the mustard tasted homemade. My husband especially loved the chilli. Overall, the food was spectacular. The service was fast and friendly, the environment was clean and comfy. We will definitely be back.

Thank you wooden spoke staff and mad respect and kudos to the Chef who made an unforgettable night full of nostalgic decor, warm and friendly interaction and phenomenal home-cooking! See you again soon!!

1.0,2019-06-24T02:41:33.058Z,Nikki Westerfield,"I am disgusted. As I just sit in this bed because I don’t want me feet all over who knows how many guests before me. We stopped here so we didn’t have to continue to drive on our long trip. All we wanted was a clean hotel where we could sleep and shower with our two children! The shower even has black hairs! Black hairs were all over the first room and we asked to switch to find the same thing. The floors are not vacuumed at all. It’s unreal. I have never stayed at a Wyndham hotel but it looked VERY nice in the photos and I never imagined it would be this dirty. The cleaning in this hotel... well there obviously wasn’t any real cleaning done. There should never be leftovers from other strangers in a hotel I paid for. I would have rather drove three more hours then not have a nice place to sleep and shower at. I am very upset and I have NEVER in my life wrote a review. I am not hard to please! The Wi-Fi code does not work. The phone does not work. The phone plug keeps falling out every time I pick up the phone. The top layer of the sheet had dirt on it or food. Looks like cake. I stay at many hotel. This is unacceptable. Also On top of this. I was told you guys price match. There was a deal online that was $20 cheaper than the right here and they said they could not do it. So even more annoyed right now that I came here because I thought I was getting a deal. After having heart issues with my bank it took a little longer than necessary which is totally my fault. My car got blocked because were out of town. I would have paid the extra money to stay in a clean hotel but after carrying all of her bags and everything up for four people, me and my husband have to work tomorrow. And both of our kids are ready for bed. None of us will be showering in the bathroom and we are all disgusted to the point we don’t want to get off our beds u less we have our shoes on.
Livid to say the least. The cleaning lady left a envelope for a tip???? She has to be joking. She needs to be fired. Oh!!! and the what class that my daughter went to use had a big black hair in it. Look close at pics! Gross!!!!

Staff is very friendly. I will say. They were nice. Although a guy followed us up to make sure the second room was clean. It wasn’t.. and he walked away and did nothing.

3.0,2022-11-07T11:29:27.016Z,Jacqueline Hartman,"We stopped at a quick one night stop to get some sleep, shower, and back get on the road. It was on the way to where we were headed, so it worked perfectly. Things that need improvement: 1. The thermostat. It was not accurate and as you can see my thermostat said it was 65% humidity, because theirs wasn’t working and wouldn’t trigger air on its own. My husband continued to smell mildew every time he walked into the room, I must have missed it the 2 times I walked in. 2. The vent, it could use some cleaning. I am not sure how clean the air we manually forced out of it was.
Good things on why I scored it high: 1. Price was great. 2. Location for us was awesome. 3. It did the job provide a nice firm mattress for us to get some good shut eye. The pillows could have been comfier, but for the price I will not complain! 4. The one person we interacted with at the desk was great. 5. Had a pool, we didn’t use it but I heard kids were enjoying it when I was checking in. 6. Overall thought things were relatively clean! 7. The bathroom was super cute and had a cool mirror/light. 8. There was a tv, but we didn’t use it. It was small for some standards, but I didn’t care as we were actually just using it for sleep.

If you are looking for a quick stop to get some good sleep and this is on the way, would 100% recommend. If you are looking for a fancier vacation hotel I would probably look elsewhere, but I’m not sure if that’s the area for fancier hotels.",Wyndham Garden Cross Lanes Charleston,,"This roadside hotel next to I-64 is a 12-mile drive from Downtown Charleston and 3.5 miles from the West Virginia State University.

When we woke up, I could see oily fingerprints on the headboard, something sneezed or splashed onto the TV, someone's grocery store card they accidentally left behind, and some rather dirty looking blood stains on one of the pillow cases.

The tiles and grout near the tub were a bit in disrepair, but overall things appeared tolerably clean and satisfactory unless you looked closely. I feel like the cleaning job is one of the biggest customer services a hotel can offer, because you don't want to feel like you're constantly touching other people's left behind germs, lube residue, etc. It was a major detraction.

The breakfast was okay but the lady behind the counter (responsible for cooking the eggs and everything) seemed spread very thin in her duties.

Drove there arriving about an hour later, booked room, went to room and changed clothes. We go down to the pool and nephew starts swimming in the pool (there's a women and child there as well.) There's a sign around hot tub saying it's closed so we go ask what the deal is since that was a deciding factor of where we stayed since the nephew was with us. The guy gets kinda rude and says the pool is closed too, but nobody seems to know why. He goes to the pool and puts makeshift sign on the door and tells everyone they need to leave. We go to room, change back into regular clothes, and head downstairs. Upon speaking to the manager apparently the pool is fine but hot tub has a leaking pipe (not what sign says) so it'll remain closed. I'm giving 2 stars rather than 1 because the refund process was pretty seamless. The place looks nice, but being told everything is good, driving almost an hour and checking in to realize it's not, then the lack of communication and poor attitude of the desk worker... ehhh.

Plenty of lounge seating and common space in lobby since they kept the check-in area/front desk small and minimal to make way for more room for amenities. Very nice patio and firepit with views of downtown KC. Decent saltwater pool and hot tub. Asked for corner room since they generally have more space, they were nice enough to oblige upon checkin.

At first glance the menu is pricey but well worth it once you receive your meal. I think the Jaeger Schnitzel sandwich is an absolute winner.

Now, as to the food: pretty good. I got the Rancocas Burger and was generally pretty impressed other than it being overcooked (ordered medium, came out well. I still ate it cause I'm not that annoying about my food). While I could be way off base, it had a sort of lack of flavor that's reminiscent of cheapish frozen beef.

We thought their would be an extra room with a king or two doubles.  Their was not.  It's all one big room.  When you walk in their are bunk beds, (the ceiling was low and the ladder was steep) then a hallway, bathroom ( with no lock on it, by the way) then the bed with a table & sofa ( that turns into a bed) then balcony.   They do have multiple restaurants, but  all of them were pricey.  They did give us a free ice cream, it was pretty good.  Alex who checked us in was very helpful.

They have multiple pools, but if you dont get  out to the lounge chairs by seven your out of luck!  Beachfront was great!  You have to rent chairs & umbrellas for the beach, so we just brought our own.  The hot tub in the indoor pool jets did not work.

1.0,2022-05-29T21:57:46.025Z,Jonathan Friedopfer,"Quick drive from Atlanta. Fun place with table games and slots which pay out well!

Update- returned and absolutely did not enjoy. After visiting many random casinos around the country and then returning I realized that the slots are outdated as well as very tight. I never expect to win however I do expect to be entertained and have fun. Additionally, all the tables had minimum $25 bets with some at $100 min. I'll happily bet $25-$100 when I'm feeling it however mandatory on every bet can drain your stack fairly quick.

The atmosphere is also dull. I enjoy the other location in cherokee a lot more.

Back to slots. Many make you hit max bet for chance to get progressive. 90% don't have any cool bonus features. The few which  have features like spin wheel or free games rarely hit. Even if a bonus feature only wins $1 at at least gives some excitement.  This place is supposed to be fun and exciting. Additionally, most times the slots are full so very few options to even pick from to play.
Why do random casinos like in Iowa, wendover- NV, FL, CT, etc  all have new fun exciting games with bonuses, freeplay, bonus side games, etc and not here. Why do all these other places allow to hit progressives on any bet? Why do they have better music, comps, atmosphere, etc?

I had to call on my phone and the front desk just asked what room I was in. They didn't even apologize that this crime had been committed, didn't offer to send someone to clean up the glass, call the cops, anything. And when I checked out they didn't say anything. I received more sympathy from the cops (just filed a report, they didn't send anyone out) and the glass repair company Safelite.

Ciara at the front desk if super awesome and friendly. One of the best things about the hotel is the location. It is located right next to the boardwalk so you can walk over and play video games and do a little budget shopping as well and go to the movie or go get ice cream. There are also several different vendors doors as well as a movie theater. Joe’s crabshack as well as bubblegum are both walking distance in addition to marble ice cream company. The hotel also have a Starbucks inside as well as a nice steakhouse called Hyde Park which is fancy and serves premium steaks,chops and cocktails.

CONS:  (none of which merit giving this resort less than 5 stars).  The resort itself is quite dated, so don't expect fancy rooms, but -especially for a beachfront resort- the common areas are in good shape.  Expect to pay exorbitant prices for everything within the resort, as goes with any vacation resort.

TIPS:  I definitely recommend spending the money for valet parking because the self-parking is a good distance away and terribly inconvenient (and isn't that much cheaper).  Try and get a room on the upper floors, beachfront, because the view is great!

Came to $125 with my FL Resident discount. They did waive the outrageous $25 per day resort fee since no amenities were available, but still charge the daily parking fee. These extra charges are why I avoid such places & stick to quiet low-key motels, but they are closed currently due to no travelers because of COVID-19. Fortunately no crowds at least. Hotel is dated, tho our room was clean. They should have the pool open since FL leaves that decision to the owner, there is no ""shut down the pools"" order by the state or county. With 4 or 5 guests in the whole hotel and being that chlorine kills viruses, it would have been nice to use the pool. When I reserved the room on the phone they tried to upsell me on ""Vacation Ownership"" too which I of course turned down, being that I already hated having to pay $100 in parking fees for a 2 day stay (2 vehicles)  They get 3 stars because the room was clean, view was good, no tourists to ruin the chill quiet I wanted & the front desk lady was nice.",Hilton Daytona Beach Oceanfront Resort,,"This modern beachside hotel is a minute's walk from the Ocean Center convention facility and a 2-minute walk from the Daytona Lagoon waterpark.

However, league doesn’t end until 9pm and about 3/4 of the lanes are dedicated to league games. We ended up waiting over and hour to bowl. Our issue is they knew league wouldn’t end until 9 and they gave us a complete unrealistic waiting time. Also multiple lanes (many next to each other) were completely open but they wouldn’t allow anyone to bowl next to league games. This is incredibly frustrating for local patrons who want to take advantage of their weekly deals. So disappointing. Also if you plan to have a night with a lot of people at the bar it would be nice to have more then one bartender to serve drinks took forever to get anything

The art posted was interesting and I actually learned a few things. The bar at the end of the museum kind of threw me off a bit - I guess I wasn't expecting to see a bar in a museum.  There were individuals in there in the evening that were under 18 years of age and around the drinking adults so that was awkward. I personally would not bring my child. Definitely meant for a mature crowd.

5.0,2022-02-20T03:34:23.091Z,Victor N,"This was a great experience! We did the Sporting KC room with 5 adults plus a 5-year old and loved it! No spoilers, so all I'll say is don't let the small room deceive you. Plenty of clever things to discover.

They will give as many hints as you would like. Only the first requested 3 hints are free though. Anything beyond those 3 result in a 3-minute penalty each. You still get a full hour to break out, no matter how many hints you use. You're time will just look longer than one hour. This is how people get scores of 64 minutes, even though you only have an hour max.

The do give free hints if they see that you're stuck. These do not count against your 3 free requested hints, nor do they penalize your time.

My advice for the uninitiated is to not be afraid to use the hints! Especially if you're not going to try again at a later date. Enjoy the puzzles, but don't let them frustrate you. Make sure someone is keeping track of time so that you can pace the free hints.

5.0,2022-02-20T03:34:23.091Z,Victor N,"This was a great experience! We did the Sporting KC room with 5 adults plus a 5-year old and loved it! No spoilers, so all I'll say is don't let the small room deceive you. Plenty of clever things to discover.

They will give as many hints as you would like. Only the first requested 3 hints are free though. Anything beyond those 3 result in a 3-minute penalty each. You still get a full hour to break out, no matter how many hints you use. You're time will just look longer than one hour. This is how people get scores of 64 minutes, even though you only have an hour max.

The do give free hints if they see that you're stuck. These do not count against your 3 free requested hints, nor do they penalize your time.

My advice for the uninitiated is to not be afraid to use the hints! Especially if you're not going to try again at a later date. Enjoy the puzzles, but don't let them frustrate you. Make sure someone is keeping track of time so that you can pace the free hints.

There is a Denver Zoo App with a map to help ease but it lacks a logo to specify children interactive areas such as the sand play area, jump like an animal etc. They have a whole play area for children, toddlers and up. The new Dinosaur exhibits are awesome and we hope they're here to stay, or at least come back next summer!! They have a dig for bones activity and a dinosaur to climb on by the carousel. They also have a whole parakeet section where you can go in and feed the birds. I wish they had a place you could feed the giraffes.

Boo at the Zoo is always a hit, we love the chapstick (only Toyota was handing out the chapstick this year). The light at the Zoo has severely improved since the last time I attended in 2011. There are so many more lights and fun events etc.

FYI you cannot bring balloons into the zoo, but you can bring food, snacks, juice boxes, and water. Food isn’t too expensive nor disgusting if you have to buy here too. Beer and BBQ is sold at the Zoo if you need that as a selling point to get the hubby to go.",Denver Zoo,,"Sprawling facility with animal exhibits, shows & demonstrations, plus venues for eating & shopping.",,4.6,0.0,True,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnb1BYM1pREAE,Zoo,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwhYPIbLPL8c3bHVOu5gNMq0_gw3J5G-6lZE2D=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZ_eqgY9oBB1BGoAb4LOOTCQg3iHGzhqNV39JC=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPspXHc0J6C0Xsd8foCTRJpPzKZ0iqoho5kh1RB=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKdkQ5SHZbVMaEzR4GO2oGejNPzzp-mRuiXJhQ=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSBv9StBjeO6TxT4vOxKz5LjKOvtiJYXpjw5KL=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3tq3CXHR_UM6OxStJhgpPdZS41sptC6P4qVjC=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwQTbdsgKdMsz2DlQ4dwQWbrDe6v-K8W3K-SOZ=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO22X8bRSAMMDtollNLlOcKRJZnC7rvje8VMPnt=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjE2oRe-E0nLFcFN8-os9r5D2fs015XYHy8Jit=w256-h256-p-k-no,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnb1BYM1pREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x53fd0ed23d876c29!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICgoPX3ZQ%7CCgwI0Y_U1QUQgPXN-gI%7C?hl=en-US,115882901216523607992,72.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5Td-0verXQveeF6xW2Lp3txRJJuTOoM9MgeiR4_=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115882901216523607992?hl=en-US,24339,2023-03-26T10:59:14.093Z,Colorado,2300 Steele St,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Denver+Zoo/@39.7167041,-104.9604587,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x876c794e20258f71:0x53fd0ed23d876c29!8m2!3d39.7501637!4d-104.948953!16zL20vMGN5bnhk?hl=en",http://www.denverzoo.org/,Zoo,Historical landmark,Non-profit organization,Zoo,activity,"[('zoo', 0.3934), ('exhibits', 0.2812), ('carousel', 0.1756), ('denver', 0.172), ('fun', 0.1611)]","['zoo', 'exhibits', 'carousel', 'denver', 'fun']","[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4334515929222107}]",,real,ChIJcY8lIE55bIcRKWyHPdIO_VM

5.0,2022-06-20T14:52:28.106Z,Andrew Parker,"My work involves a lot of travel and I’ve been fortunate to visit multiple arcades around the world, including Japan. I’d easily rank the four Free Play locations in the DFW metro area collectively as the best arcades I’ve visited in the United States. In fact, I think the fact they routinely acquire new games and swap out machines on the floor gives them an advantage over the few remaining retro Japanese arcades.

In short, THIS is how you do an arcade right. I hate the term “barcade” but I suppose this is one in the sense they have an impressive bar and kitchen on site. That said, unlike almost every other self-styled barcade I’ve visited, the drinks and food complement the games rather than serve as the primary attraction.

What sets Free Play apart is the diversity and rarity of its games. These feature some true gems on original hardware that go well beyond the dime-a-dozen Pac-Man and Centipede cabs found elsewhere. For example, the Richardson location (at the time of this writing) has an ultra-rare Planet Harriers, an Atomiswave running Dolphin Blue, the first Beast Busters, Do Don Pachi, Power Stone 2, and the original Marvel Vs. Capcom…to name just a few. I’m not really into pinball but there are quite a few of those machines on the floor too.

My boyfriend and I made eating here our anniversary dinner tradition several years ago, and it does not disappoint. The bow tie pasta is incredible, and the chicken alfredo pasta is great, too. I've never had food here I didn't like. However, the real star of the show is the phyllo brownie - you just can't come here without getting one!! You can come to Paulo and Bill dressed up for a special occasion, and students sometimes come in dressed up for proms or homecoming, and yet if you are wearing a t-shirt and jeans, you won't feel too out of place, either.

Other son got lasagna, also good and husband got a beef pasta.... deburgo, very spicy, perfect for his taste. Nice that the calamari came with both warm marinara and cool lemon aioli, as my family was split on preference, but stealing garlic bread almost resulted in a fork in the hand! Only disappointment was that sweet tea came as tea with sugar packets, which any tea lover knows doesn't dissolve well when tea is cold and... my husband was asked if he wanted parmesan cheese and pepper on his meal but when server came back she said that the parmesan ""hadn't been taken out yet,"" asking if just black pepper was okay?

Upon entering, we were immediately hit with a strong mold smell. Our room A/C unit was also set at 60. We turned it to heat and began suffocating from an enveloping odor of mold/mildew. Everything--carpet and sheets, felt damp. We asked to move but were told all rooms were taken. Suspecting water damage, I found peeling wallpaper near the floor and doors in the hallway. Inspecting the room, ceiling paint was cracking, falling away, and stained with water rings. The walls are weak and give under pressure near the floor under the window. Metal fixings (hinges, pipes, hangers...) are rusted. There are cobwebs in the corners, and plenty of pubic hairs on the bathroom floor. The door sign with the room prices is yellowed, smudged (mildew?), and has hair hanging from it. The free wifi had 1 bar at best and really never stayed connected throughout our stay.

The outside and interior is in good condition.

My non-smoking room was on the third floor, was in good condition and didn't smell. However, the elevator and the entire 3rd floor smelled like cigarette smoke. The closet was tiny, but there were plenty of drawers in the dresser.

The room had plenty of room to walk around in and for a couple of people to sit comfortably. I had a king size bed and it was very comfortable.

Breakfast was alright. I had sausage patties, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy and a waffle with coffee and oj. Coffee tasted like flavored water. They also had apple juice, toast, bagels, cereal and oatmeal.

When my husband and I stayed, we found brown spots on the unwashed sheets and pillowcases, stained flooring, dirty walls, broken door and window locks, many patched holes in the wall, and a broken phone and picture frame.  We have stayed in hotels in third world countries that were cleaner and more kept up.  It took 45 minutes for them to switch us to a new room, where we discovered a crust spot on the bed cover.  Instead of an apology, the owner stated ""Well, I asked the housekeeper to check it for me.""  They brought a new bed cover after another 20 minutes.  We did not feel comfortable there not knowing if they even changed the sheets.  Instead of relaxing, we had to leave shortly after for our concert.  After we complained in the morning, the front desk lady asked us ""What kind of crust spot was it?"" in lieu of an apology.  I asked her how we were to know and why it mattered.  She then offered $10 off, which was not worthy of accepting.  The owner did not offer anything else and obviously does not take pride in her business.

Upon entering, we were immediately hit with a strong mold smell. Our room A/C unit was also set at 60. We turned it to heat and began suffocating from an enveloping odor of mold/mildew. Everything--carpet and sheets, felt damp. We asked to move but were told all rooms were taken. Suspecting water damage, I found peeling wallpaper near the floor and doors in the hallway. Inspecting the room, ceiling paint was cracking, falling away, and stained with water rings. The walls are weak and give under pressure near the floor under the window. Metal fixings (hinges, pipes, hangers...) are rusted. There are cobwebs in the corners, and plenty of pubic hairs on the bathroom floor. The door sign with the room prices is yellowed, smudged (mildew?), and has hair hanging from it. The free wifi had 1 bar at best and really never stayed connected throughout our stay.

3.0,2021-06-28T16:48:09.297Z,Ben P,"Pros: some fun stuff for kids! Go karts, bumper boats, rock climb, trampoline jump. There are also laser tag and mini golf available. There is a game room with some arcade style games, snacks, etc. Kids will love everything here, and you might too.

Cons: EXPENSIVE! Understand before you go that tickets for just outside activities are $30 per person... For 2 hours. That's $120 for a family of 4. Want to play a doubt of mini golf? That's not included... That's another $18... Per person. So now you're up to $200. Wanna try laser tag?it's very fun, but also not included.

Your kids will want to play the arcade games to win tickets, you can buy game passes for a time limit.

During fully open operation and during the summer it is *crowded* so lines are long so be prepared to wait.

Bottom line - kids will have a blast, go on off-peak days if you can, look online or ask about packages for activities and games, and be prepared to shell out a lot of money for the afternoon; if you're not ready to either drop a couple hundred bucks or disappoint the kids by telling them ""no"" then maybe come back a different time.",Hinkle Fun Center,,"Family recreation spot featuring bumper cars, laser tag, paintball & more along with an arcade.",,4.4,11.0,True,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaEppWGpBRRAB,Amusement center,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCltabjNCyLvbb3_9NILsQYFXghdXfJlUSJLfw=w256-h256-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuzGWmvQohHP8cPa4yYabmBAQNflVbvLqFtbX4=w256-h256-p-k-no,,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaEppWGpBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x412edc9effd42a9e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDqhJiXjAE%7CCgwIyfrnhgYQsMbajQE%7C?hl=en-US,107238146596747514590,93.0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5QfMXh1ck3MWoxsiJnLCWk2U3XBnUejCRT3VvVZgQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107238146596747514590?hl=en-US,2249,2023-03-26T11:04:01.183Z,New Mexico,12931 Indian School Rd NE,False,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hinkle+Fun+Center/@35.0821683,-106.8165631,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8718a04616bd7ba3:0x412edc9effd42a9e!8m2!3d35.0955452!4d-106.4982381!16s%2Fg%2F1tyt5tdn?hl=en",https://www.hinklefuncenter.com/,Amusement center,,,Amusement center,activity,"[('cons', 0.448), ('pros', 0.3603), ('arcade', 0.2601), ('fun', 0.2242), ('activities', 0.218)]","['cons', 'pros', 'arcade', 'fun', 'activities']","[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4339221715927124}]",,real,ChIJo3u9FkagGIcRnirU_57cLkE

The patio furniture is run down and the fire ants bite- don’t take your shoes off !!
Seriously that isn’t grass- it’s the pool.    The ice machine was down on 3 floors and the list goes on.

One thing worth noting is I’d consider staying on the left side facing the beach or in the inner right to avoid the partial view a restaurants roof, had the room to the right of the presidential suite for reference.  Nothing huge but worth mentioning.  The private beach is directly behind the hotel and easy to get back and forth. Multiple places to eat and all were on par with the resort.  Several other upscale amenities, activities and services are available consistent with other Hilton resorts. Another bonus is they provide shuttle service to Baytown Wharf which is close to the resort, among other places.

3.0,2022-04-07T01:25:08.098Z,Jonathan Brito,"I wish I loved this meal, but honestly I could have had better in Boston and that's not saying much.

The baked potato was delicious and very flavorful, but the strip steak with blue cheese crust was all panko breadcrumbs and very little blue cheese. The steak was also a bit tough for the $39 price tab.

Service was also very slow. 40 minute wait for a table that never came so I sat at the bar instead and then waited another 10 minutes to have my drink request taken.

The glass of red wine I chose was out of stock, so I had to choose something different and waited another 10 minutes for someone to ask if I wanted a drink. Surprisingly, the meal came out quickly, in about 15 minutes, but having to wait nearly 1.5 hours for an okay steak and a delicious baked potato was disappointing.

The restaurant was busy, but the two bartenders (and one additional bartender / waitress that kept floating in and out of the bar) with a devoted barback should be able to handle a dinner crowd.",J.

3.0,2022-08-01T01:56:37.314Z,Lauren Stewart,The ambiance was very romantic for our wedding anniversary. The server was also very nice and helpful with the menu. I got the fillet 4oz combo with 3 bourbon maple shrimp. I was underwhelmed when I saw how small the steak looked and it was well done not medium. It was also dry and needed a sauce. The shrimp was flavorful and tasty. The sides were good but nothing to rave about. My husband got the cajan spiced pan roasted fillet which was seasoned nicely but was very clean..small portions all around. The au gratin was lukewarm and the mushroom was on top of the steak and not really a side. The dessert of the 7 layer coconut cake was very moist and good but I don't care for the passion fruit coulis.,J.

House made lemonade is sour-ly delicious

Fish tacos are perfectly fried and the sauce they have in the tacos really makes it taste better.

Salad is good, but the fried croutons with it is just yum!

Veggie burger is pretty thick, has flavor but isn't too dry.  The fries are like drugs.  Once you start you can't stop.

Dessert
Chocolate bunt cake is lovely.  Perfectly moist and sweet that it doesn't overpower the vanilla ice cream.  Sweet but not super sweet.  If that makes sense.
Pumpkin pie, is really simply done without added surger.  The pie crust is wonderfully done where you can't tell where it ends and the pumpkin moose begins.

5.0,2021-06-15T01:17:45.484Z,Roberto Sabas,"It was my first time staying at a hostel and I'm glad it was at this location, close to the lake in a nice area. Compared to many a 1-star motel or hotel, it's bare bones in room amenities, but the sense of community and the savings are good reasons to consider staying in one. What comes to mind is a boarding house, which I suppose hostels are akin to, but the staff at this place are helpful and responsive to guest needs and concerns. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and the nice patio area. Our fellow guests were from various places and the ones we met were friendly.

Nearby are many nice restaurants, cafes, businesses, conveniences, and bars. To the east is the North Pond, and further the lake shore. You can walk, run, or bike to your heart's content (convenient for pet owners too as it's very pet friendly in the area). It's less than 15 minutes away from the conservatory and the zoo (both free). There are are wonderful museums both in the area and a little further away (but in stone's throw).

Tips: 1) bring your own food to store in the plentiful refrigerated cases (they provide bins and labels) to save on dining expenses or if you have specific dietary requirements. 2) Their parking spaces are limited so arrive within 5 minutes of check-in. It's $28 a night to park there. 3) Alternatively, use an app like SpotHero to book affordable longer term spaces in the area (12 hours to a several days). 4) the kitchen is huge and well maintained, but do your part to help keep it that way (same goes for the bathrooms). 5) if you're looking for fun things to do, check out the activities chalkboard in the lobby. 6) Be respectful, kind, and friendly to everyone there.

1.0,2018-10-02T12:36:21.928Z,Ash C,"1 star for a subpar/gross experience at Chicago Getaway Hostel. I rented a private room for 3 nights looking for a clean/decent place to sleep and shower while I was in the city for a work project. Chicago Getaway Hostel did not fit the bill.

The Hostel is in a beautiful Lincoln Park neighborhood with tons of giant trees and you really can't find a better location to get the LP vibe but then walk a block to hop on trains/buses. The cost for a private room is comparable to a hotel room, but I chose this place because it's location was within walking distance to where I was going to be working. After looking at reviews and photos of the hostel, it seemed like a very modern and clean place that I would be comfortable staying at... unfortunately the photos were deceiving and the reviews did not represent my experience.

When I walked up to the building, I had to walk through a crowd of people gathering on the sidewalk outside the hostel smoking (great for my asthma) to enter the building. This happened every time I entered/exited the building over the next few days, which was a real turn off to me. The check in process was quick - the person checking me in rushed through all of the instructions and gave me no written document that verified what he went over, so that was fun.

My room looked nice at first glance - 2 bunk beds, a desk, shower/toilet/sink. All the essentials. Upon further investigation here's what I found (some photos attached)... the bathroom was absolutely disgusting. I don't know when it was last cleaned, but it had to have been a long time. The amount of dirt/grime built up in that shower made me feel dirtier than I was when I walked in. One shouldn't have to buy flip flops to shower in a private room bathroom they rented. There was buildup ON THE SHOWER HEAD where the clean water is supposed to come out of but there was nastiness caked on so it passed through that first.

The beds were pretty uncomfortable. The mattress was very thin and I could feel the bars through it, so it was rough sleeping. A majority of the linens had a ton of stains/loose hairs on them (especially the pillows) and they were very rough in texture.

I was shocked because we expect so much more from a Marriott. I called and asked for the room to be cleaned while we were gone for a few hours, telling them that the floor was really dirty and the phone had so much dust on it it appeared it hadn't been cleaned in a very long time (just to give them some examples of the problems.) When we came back, it was clear someone had wiped down the phone briefly and swept the tile floor in the doorway, but the room was still filthy. I called again and let them know, and to their credit, they upgraded us to a much nicer much cleaner room. And I wasn't allergic to this room which was visibly less dusty and dirty.
We were thankful for the upgrade, but it should have never been necessary. I shouldn't walk into a room in a Marriott property to find it so dirty.

Checked in easily. But the key card stopped working when we left the room the first time and had to come back twice to get a replacement.
We weren't told to keep our phones away from the card until the third replacement.
We left for 3 hours and turned the AC down while gone.  Came back and the room was so hot we almost threw up packing up our stuff.
They then gave us a different room after we had to carry everything which took us 2 trips the first time down to the lobby back to the 5th floor. They did give us free breakfast for the inconvenience but would of been nice if they could of met us on the floor instead of 2 trips down to get the room and 1 trip with the luggage cart up.
Breakfast was so so half of the buffet was kinda cold. Wouldn't pay for it so for a free breakfast it's decent.
They also didn't explain any charges so I had a mini panic attacks that they charged me an extra 100 for my room only to go down and have the free explained

When we got in the room we noticed there was a cabinet for a refrigerator, but no refrigerator. I called the desk and was asked if I requested one. I told her no, that I didn't think I had to since EVERY hotel I've stayed in for the last 25 or more years had one in the room. I take prescription medication that must be refrigerated. I explained that to her. She said she would notify housekeeping. Several hours later I went to the desk and asked again, stressing my need for a refrigerator, again explaining my situation. We stayed for 2 nights and never got a refrigerator. I guess i should be grateful there was an ice bucket. Hopefully it didn't compromise the effectiveness of my prescription.
In addition, there was no microwave.
When we returned to our room the housekeeper was at the end of the hall.
There was a pile of dirty towels outside our room. We went out and when we returned hours later the housekeeper was gone but the pile of towels were still there. My husband called the desk to tell them they forgot to pick them up, they thanked him and assured him it will be taken care of. They were still there this morning when we left.

This facility far exceeded my expectations. The dressing rooms and facility itself was clean and updated. It was $35 for all three of us (out of city residents) to swim/play all day which isn't even one ticket at other water parks. We have been to our fair share of water parks, splash pads, etc. and I have never experienced lifeguards and staff remain so continuously attentive and alert in their positions. Not once did I see a lifeguard distracted by their cell phones, talking to each other, nothing of the sort.

My wife and I shared the deviled eggs and they were pretty good. We enjoyed a Moscow Mule and a Mojito. I had prime rib and it was cooked perfectly.

There is a large game room with electronic type fun games that I'm pretty sure we won't be taking little girls too? A workout room with treadmill etc.

2.0,2022-06-12T22:29:10.019Z,angel taylor,"For nearly $500/night, I was expecting more than the standard hotel however, it was nothing more than average.  The front desk was nice but I had to walk by an overly full garbage can when walking in, so that set the tone. I wouldn’t mind really, but it was that way every day that I was there. The can in the pool area was also overflowing by lunch and never changed until the end of the day.
This place has a smaller than average pool with very little seating. Approx 20 lounge chairs and there was room for many more. There were no umbrellas or tables In the pool area and very little shade.  There is a small bar outside that had some shaded seating. Prices for cocktails was $12+ .  Bring your ant spray, as there was an abundance of ants around the pool.  The breakfast seating area is a decent size but it doesn’t accommodate the amount of people that can stay at that hotel. I know it’s not reasonable to plan for every patron to eat breakfast at the same time however, when it’s 15-20 min wait to make a waffle or wait on some other item to come out so you can have something before they close the doors on you, then it’s a problem.
Our room had a rusted, I mean RUSTED, like throw it away it’s so rusty, lamp.

Room was very clean, gulf view, great AC, and it was quiet. Across the street are a few restaurants, walking distance to Starbucks. Publix and Walmart very close by.

Construction is starting next door on new giant condos so the peace and quiet May be gone soon…. That’s also the same side as the bar.",Hampton Inn & Suites Orange Beach/Gulf Front,,"Off State Route 182, this contemporary beachfront hotel is a 5-minute walk from downtown Orange Beach.

I don’t usually nitpick, but I was paying $400 a night and find some things just not excusable at that price.
They don’t have daily maid service, and you have to go down to get towels/toilet paper and take out your own trash. Again, for the price I was paying, I think daily service would be expected. You can only get a full service every 5 days.
They are dog friendly, which is amazing…but there was no place to take them to the bathroom. The abandoned lot next door was what we opted for, but it was filled with thorny and burred plants. They are not allowed on the beach (city law) so there are really no options. At one point we tried to use a tiny patch of grass outside the fence, but the bartender from the pool told us it was gross to have them within eyesight and we needed to take our dogs off property to use the bathroom.",Hampton Inn & Suites Orange Beach/Gulf Front,,"Off State Route 182, this contemporary beachfront hotel is a 5-minute walk from downtown Orange Beach.

Rooms are pretty plain and simple, but that doesnt matter. I cant imagine many people will spend much time in their room, except to sleep.🛌 The hotel🏢 is directly on the beach! 🏖👐🙌👏

A lounge chair rental service w is available for rent at $35 a day. You can walk directly from the hotel to the beach via a wooden  boardwalk w a few stairs. The white sand is so soft and the sound of the waves just took our stress away. ⛱️

Outside pool and hottub also face the beach.

Parking permit for the garage at check in. Easily elevator access frlm the garage too.

Most rooms with balconies facing the ocean are double beds🛌 instead of kings, which could be good for families.

🧽Very clean, did I mention clean!!!🧼 Absolutely will return to this Hampton when we are in town again. Very satisfied multi year diamond member here.

There is an outside tiki bar for drinks and the full beach affect too! 🍸🍷🍹

During the stay a 🌀storm blew in and it was very cold, so we hit the hot tub. I saw alot of kiddos playing in the pool and a few adults.

The hotel itself is in decent condition with updated modern designs and comfort. The doors going into the room and balcony could have used a little maintenence. The room had a spectacular view of the Gulf and we enjoy the balcony alot. The pool/hottub was clean enough and a had great temps every time. Their beach area was always kept nice and we spent alot of time just enjoying the waves.
The breakfast was always served hot and there was always plenty even though we often ate towards the end of the meal time. They serve you instead of you picking what you want - Covid19 restrictions.
The only reason they are losing a star - we had to ask for everything. Since they are not cleaning the rooms and restocking supplies and clean towels each day, we were left to ask for toilet paper, new paper cups, coffee, etc. Several times it seemed as though they didn't want to get anything for us and that we were imposing on them to ask for a trash bags or whatever. I would suggest having a time frame each morning that the guests could get what they need without ""disturbing"" the front desk staff. Other than that the staff was pleasant.
One of the elevators was out of service the entire time we were there. Apparently it has been out for several weeks.. while most of time it wasn't too long of a wait, during the weekends it got a little crazy.

Well tasting the Mahbarawi is the first time that I cried from food being that good. I generally don't trust restaurants that only have five reviews, where all five are four or five stars, and most of them come from reviewers with little to no reviews. Well, I'm glad that I took the risk. For less than $20 I enjoyed one of the best meals of my life, with a lovely cup of tea, and service as good as one could hope for. They customized the spice level for me, and the cabbage, potatoes, beets, lentils, and greens perfectly balanced the spiciness of the meat. The flavors, the texture, the presentation, were all a symphony to the senses. If I lived in the area, I would eat here at least once a week.

The food was absolutely delicious, and the price was very fair, especially considering that we ordered a platter for four people and couldn't even finish it! My friend really enjoyed the mango smoothie, but I found it a bit too sweet and heavy. The one downside was that the restaurant was very busy, and they occasionally forgot to bring our additional orders. Also, they charged us the wrong amount, so it's important to double-check your tab during checkout.

Well tasting the Mahbarawi is the first time that I cried from food being that good. I generally don't trust restaurants that only have five reviews, where all five are four or five stars, and most of them come from reviewers with little to no reviews. Well, I'm glad that I took the risk. For less than $20 I enjoyed one of the best meals of my life, with a lovely cup of tea, and service as good as one could hope for. They customized the spice level for me, and the cabbage, potatoes, beets, lentils, and greens perfectly balanced the spiciness of the meat. The flavors, the texture, the presentation, were all a symphony to the senses. If I lived in the area, I would eat here at least once a week.
