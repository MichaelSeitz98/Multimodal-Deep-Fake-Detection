I tried the gnocchi and it was delicious, perfectly cooked with a flavorful sauce. My friend had the lasagna and said it was some of the best she's ever had. The only downside was the wait time for our table, as we had to wait about 30 minutes even though we had reservations. However, the food and service made up for it. Overall, I would recommend the Italian Restaurant to anyone who loves Italian cuisine and wants to have a nice, cozy dinner out with friends or family.\"\n",

They have lots of different games and machines to choose from and a big variety of music and entertainment tastes.\\nIf you live in Michigan I'd recommend stopping in you'll have a great time. If you live out of state like me and are planning a trip to Michigan I would definitely include Playland at Oakland University in your plans. \n",

They obviously don’t want to do business as there was literally no one dining in but me and my husband. We literally waited 35 minutes for ANYONE to even acknowledge our existence. And even then, it was the hostess walking up to tell us our table is ready when we’ve been standing at the entrance waiting to be seated for literally 30 minutes. The restaurant itself is very clean, which is a nice surprise (not sure how) when 99% of it was closed. And even still, the food was disgusting and the chicken had raw spots in it and the cheese in the quesadilla was uncooked and disgusting. I’m so upset that I chose to eat here.\n",

I enjoyed the Star Route, a huge steak cooked medium and with all the fixings. My wife enjoyed the salmon, cooked perfectly and with a great sauce. Our daughter had the chicken tenders which she liked very much and our son surprised us by ordering s prime rib Oscar style, it was very thick and he only ate a little of it, perhaps his second choice would have been a better selection. \n",

They don’t have more than 100$ special machines. They have a lot of good games, a bar and appetizer station inside and a larger bar outside next to the forest. They don’t serve food inside but they have a good selection of food nearby. Parking is suck. if you don’t get to there early than its challenging to find free parking. It only cost 15 dollars to park there but the construction and lack of spaces makes it not worth it. \n",

I expected enchiladas to come with rice and beans and they did; but they were mere puddings.

He came out to talk with guests and ask if everything was to their liking.\\n\\nThis is my absolute favorite place to come for authentic African/Ethiopian cuisine.
