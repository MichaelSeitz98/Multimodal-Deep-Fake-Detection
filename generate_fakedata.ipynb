I tried the gnocchi and it was delicious, perfectly cooked with a flavorful sauce. My friend had the lasagna and said it was some of the best she's ever had. The only downside was the wait time for our table, as we had to wait about 30 minutes even though we had reservations. However, the food and service made up for it.
