I opened the box and was immediately disappointed. It looked like something I could have bought from a random guy in a mall food court rather than a refurbished phone. The scratches were not huge or deep but where very visible when the light hit them even at an arms length to everyone that looked at it. Requested the return a few minutes after opening the box and shipped it back the very next morning. I did get a quick refund with no real hassle but would have rather had a phone with a decent screen. I then ordered the renewed premium. The last two photos are what I ended up receiving where someone had put on a tape type protector that left a disgusting layer of thick sticky residue completely covering the touch screen. After about a solid two hours of cleaning and I finally had a clean phone but for being renewed premium that’s a bit ridiculous. No scratches obvious on the screen of the second phone and generally happy with the performance but the arrival appearance probably would have made me ship it back again if I was not stubborn to the core. It’s like Amazon wanted me to return both and go to Apple and to buy a brand new phone (which was the next step if I couldn’t get the screen clean on the second one).","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/61GFMLNXUhL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/71EOfOx-1mL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/71KJMLnkToL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/71ipBn8dfmL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/61sOGAQZF8L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/711wFgfU4+L._SY88.jpg",,"One person found this helpful","Returned it","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BPWFJIY43WS7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08BHXG144","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 24, 2022","HeatherHeather","Size: 256GBColor: Space GrayService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed"

And the longer the day went on the more the cracks started to spread.So had to return that phone which made me very skeptical of getting the iPhone 11 Pro Max instead.I had literally no problems with setting it up or transferring everything, which was such a relief.Have had this phone for a few months and so far no cracks, no scrapes, camera works beautiful, and I can actually hear people when I’m on the phone! The iPhone 11 had TERRIBLE audio and I always had to turn on speaker for calls yet could barely hear.I don’t normally do reviews but this surprised me with how well it’s going. 🙌🏻🥹🥹","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/61GFMLNXUhL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/71EOfOx-1mL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/71KJMLnkToL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/71ipBn8dfmL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/61sOGAQZF8L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/711wFgfU4+L._SY88.jpg",,"7 people found this helpful","Skeptical after previous experience","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3J3E9NSGFTRPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08BHXG144","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 16, 2022","Liz Crocker","Size: 64GBColor: Space GrayService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed"

Reducing overall rating to 4-stars.Summary: Upgrading from an iPhone 7 plus, and decided I would go with the 11 Pro Max version. I was on the fence whether the extra money for the premium renewed is worth it, so will be discussing what I considered.Observations: The high level basic differences are: 1) about a $100 difference; 2) three vs. 12 months return period: 3) battery level of 80% vs. 90%. Recommendation: After considering the factors, I decided to look into how much a replacement battery would cost, which is $40 right now. However, starting with the iPhone 8 (i think), Apple started sealing the cases, which requires a heat gun to separate the case because of the extra waterproofing adhesive. To breakdown the addition $100 cost, subtract the $40 battery from that, leaving $60 for an additional 9-months (or $6.67/month) to ""insurance"" to return the phone if issues come up.Carrier Lock: I decided I wanted an unlocked version, and that appears to be another feature that is included with Premium Renewed, with the majority of carrier locked versions being offered as renewed only.Conclusion: For the additional $100, I elected to go with the Renewed Premium. I rate both the Renewed and the Premium Renewed as 5-stars. Which you chose would depend on individual financial and personal factors.Related Products:Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, US Version, 256GB, Midnight - Unlocked (Renewed)4.3 out of 5 stars    12,122 ratings | 1000+ answered questionsPrice: $491.86https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z4681LQ/ Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, 256GB, Midnight Green - Unlocked (Renewed Premium)4.3 out of 5 stars    12,122 ratings | 1000+ answered questionsPrice: $586.00https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BHFGJXF","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41awbSh37uL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IXLUVMvCL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714Gc1kC8aL._SY88.jpg",,,,,"25 people found this helpful","Is Renewed Premium worth the extra money?","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TVOATKFWT50D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08BHXG144","Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2023","aTypicalEngineer808aTypicalEngineer808","Size: 256GBColor: Midnight GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed"

All was done in less than 30 minutes.  The part that took the longest was adding the Apple Watch to the new phone.  The whole process took another 40 minutes.

That's only due to me not having headphones to test at the time as well as the SIM card. I've a screenshot of speed test working on T-Mobile network LTE. So it works fine.Initially I ordered an iPhone 11 Pro Max for my mother, 64GB version. Unfortunately, the ear piece wasn't working and contacted the seller via Amazon message center. I had to send the phone back in order to complete the replacement.They provided the  2-day shipping label (sent out on Saturday, arrived there Monday). They kept in pretty close contact with me and that was good. They shipped Tuesday and received Thursday morning. So there's very little delay in getting the replacement.Diagnostics checked out (see screenshots). The Earpiece tests that failed were due to me not having a headphone to try it on at the time. But I'm assuming it works and will edit if that changes.The condition of the phone is near new! No blemishes on the body and screen looks really clean. There was very minute permanent lines in the screen that looked like smudges, but they with the sceen on, you don't notice it at all. PLUS they gave us a couple acrylic screen protectors, so that was a major plus!The BONUS (at least for me)!It turned out to be a blessing in disguise for me, because they ended up upgrading me to the 256GB model free (initially 64GB model). My mom didn't understand what that meant, and I pretty much explained that she can download apps and take photos to her hearts desire LOL.It's a phone for mom, and she's coming from a Samsung A21 phone that had performance issues and wifi problems. Kept saying there's no internet and reboots in safemode. I wanted simplicity with Face-ID (which also works) that pretty much takes care of itself, and iOS delivers on that.So ya, experienced issues. All devices will have a defect one way or the other (or none). You just need to contact their support and work with them before submitting your review. It annoys me when someone says ""It's defective"" with no resolution comments of what they ended up doing.If I need another replacement phone, I'll definitely do business with them again.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610mOtio9iL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6194qMOp5JL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61M3Lp3Wk0L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TTe+BAkAL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xpp-XKsEL._SY88.jpg",,,"22 people found this helpful","Had issues, but was taken care of by their support with a bonus!

Very happy with it, everything is perfect except for the fact that it was not fully cleaned, there is still a lot of dirt in the cracks and crevices, the speakers were still covered in junk and I wish it was cleaned thoroughly! The dirt and grime that was left in the speakers, silent button, camera cracks, only makes me wonder what is under the hood which is extremely concerning and dangerous, being that it is a major health hazard for it to be that way nowadays. It should have been cleaned properly. It is dirty and it still has a lot of junk in the cracks and stuff however I am satisfied with the condition, it is as advertised, great battery capacity, very new!

You have to be so certain that this product is unlocked because it wasn’t unlocked when I received it and I had took the phone to verify it wasn’t going to be back log with anyone information. Turns out they had some information about who had this phone before I did but it was briefly in someone’s possession for those three days. So I wouldn’t really cold as a renewal product but more like a refurbish product. The iPhone does not come with its Apple box but with an after marketing box with and without the original iPhone wall charger. I decided not to use that wall charger and use my own wall chargers that have been certified by Apple. I don’t think the wall charger that comes with my device or with your device may be certified by Apple.The storage is great to have especially for video creators like myself but the phone does perform very very well and I couldn’t complain too much about my experience dealing with Amazon and buying an Apple product open Amazon. So this should give you some insight on why you should go directly to the Apple store and buy an apple product from the Apple Store. Also you should take it to the Apple Store, to check for warranty optionsUpdate: March 1st 2022I have to make a shocking discovery about this device it turns out they replace the screen in the camera with third-party parts that are not certified by Apple. I took it to Apple to get a diagnostic and turns out the screen wasn’t even an apple screen. The reason why I had very suspicion about the device is how I received it. Also the screen was sometimes black out this is when I became very suspicious while playing a video game on the device. So I continue to ask Apple if they can replace the screen and they told me no. So I took it to a third-party Certified Applerepair shop that fixes iPhones correctly, not only a pay for a new screen but also paid for a new camera that was actually fixed on this device. I pretty much got scammed. I contacted Amazon and spoke to several people about this incident","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T2/images/I/61V7RvQshUL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T2/images/I/61tb+2j+N4L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T2/images/I/71GtNafj6pL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T2/images/I/613zA1di6nL._SY88.jpg",,,,"9 people found this helpful","iPhone wasn’t Unlocked, Phone had some minor imperfections","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20ZPVFPT8P1L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08BHXG144","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 14, 2022","ThePandaPhotographerThePandaPhotographer","Size: 512GBColor: Space GrayService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed"
