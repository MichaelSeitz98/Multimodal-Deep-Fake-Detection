"My husband and I had our anniversary dinner here and it was amazing! The service from the time we walked in was incredible. They sat us immediately and the waiter was very prompt. The chef, Jeff, greeted us personally and even presented our dessert for us!
My husband had the chicken, which was flavorful and juicy. I had pasta with shrimp, which I recommend highly! We had the pear bruschetta appetizer and I would also highly recommend it!

"Best EVER garlic bread!!!!  Literally made my day! Ha! That pesto garlic dipping sauce was divine with that perfectly cooked bread. I got a yummy delicious HUGE plate of bowtie chicken, enough for lunch tomorrow as well. One son got Sicilian pizza, good (not really spicy as listed) but also plenty for leftovers. Other son got lasagna, also good and husband got a beef pasta.... deburgo, very spicy, perfect for his taste. Nice that the calamari came with both warm marinara and cool lemon aioli, as my family was split on preference, but stealing garlic bread almost resulted in a fork in the hand! Only disappointment was that sweet tea came as tea with sugar packets, which any tea lover knows doesn't dissolve well when tea is cold and... my husband was asked if he wanted parmesan cheese and pepper on his meal but when server came back she said that the parmesan ""hadn't been taken out yet,"" asking if just black pepper was okay?

"PUMP is a great place to have brunch. I came here for my birthday and absolutely loved it the second I walked in. I heard about this place when I went to Vegas. They have a pump in Vegas at the Caesars Palace, and I fell in love with that place, so I was excited to hear that there was one closer in West Hollywood. When you first walk in, it’s like you’re entering a secret garden. We were seated right away in their beautiful outside area. I highly recommend eating outside to get the whole experience; instead of eating inside, it literally felt like you’re eating in a garden. Our waiter was super nice, super friendly, and was efficient. My husband and I ordered drinks and appetizers. Then we ordered our food, and everything was delicious and yummy. It was a really great romantic experience. The only thing that could’ve been better was their dessert menu. Also, I was confused about the parking situation. We didn’t see a valet or a parking lot. We found street meter parking across the street.

"Trendy restaurant that’s part of the Vanderbilt empire. Come here for the pretty decor and to say that you’ve been here. The food is mediocre, but the photo ops are plentiful. Wear something cute!

Metered street parking (2 hour limit). It’ll be tough to find any free parking close to the restaurant (it’s right in the heart of WeHo). Credit cards accepted. Reservations available and there’s a 90 min limit for the dining experience. Gender neutral restrooms. Outdoor dining available.

Food-wise, everything is overpriced for what it is. The burrata appetizer came with 4 slices of toast and tomatoes, but only a small portion of burrata. I got the lox benedict, which came with four small potatoes, but a surprisingly good amount of salad. The avocado toast was a bit soggy, but it’s a good vegetarian option. We didn’t do drinks because we were recovering from the night before, but note that the sparkling water is ~$12. Service was nice but slow.

"Okay wooooow! I was not expecting this to be what it was. Well, food wise anyhow I was pleasantly surprised. Anything on the West Hollywood strip, I’m expecting to be a tacky, but in the spirit of location, a super fun experience. It is decked out, very Hollywood. I don’t watch whatever show they have, but for those who do and are coming for a visit, I say hit this place. The folks I sat next too at the bar were super excited to be there. In short, good food, drinkable drinks, and beautiful atmosphere.
I’ve only been here once and sat at the bar, so I cannot speak to the full dining experience, but the bar was very mediocre, they have the look but not the talent which made it disappear (or maybe just not the resources to make good drinks). If I ever return I’m drinkin wine. Full menu is available at the bar, it is open seating. Prices are a little high, but your paying for location so forget about it.

THE FOOD: nothing salty, some items may need salt. Low on the crazy flavor scale. Pretty presentation.

Fish and Chips: for the win! Fish was lightly seasoned, cooked to perfection, and the fries were goody good good. Appreciate and liked the tarter sauce and malt!

Burger: basic and boring, but the fries again, good good.

Popcorn Shrimp: for the win!

Potato Salad: 100% a joke. I the chef made this so be funny. Like, just to see who would eat it or return it. We returned it.

"We absolutely loved it! I was really surprised about the quality of the foods. I thought it might be mediocre because they probably don't have to worry about getting guests because of the TV show. The food was outstanding and I'm super high maintenance about quality! We came for the happy hour and got 4 different appetizers. Best fries I have ever had with a great dip. The wontons had quite a bit raw tuna and they were also paying attention to the presentation. The taste was really divine and rounded with balsamic reduction, pomegranate and avocado. The shrimp was garnished with mango. They had quite a few people who were serving so you didn't have to wait and they were super friendly,   and everyone was quite attractive.

The only 2 things that could be improved are: 1. They only serve happy hour items in the garden, on 2 tables and then those tables didn't have a server (but one guy was willing to serve us). 2. It was my birthday and when I got the reservation it asked for occasion and I wrote birthday and I kinda thought someone would at least say ""Happy Birthday"" to me.

"Went here for a 3rd, 4th, & now a 5th time and each encounter seems to be better than the last. The servers are lovely presentations and complement the atmospheric beauty that the decor of Pump offers! The food comes out within excellent timing, is art to the eyes, and tastes just as good as the ""vibes"" you feel just from being there.

Note: If you're getting food at a sit-down table please get seated and wait for your server, don't go to the bar for beverages. I was a server once upon a time and this to me is dining etiquette 101.

Overall, I love this place and as a new ""local"" to the area, I would one day love to meet the owners to thank them for the experience and for creating a place for memories to be made.

Best,

Cory!

"OK.  I went here since my wife is a fan of RHOBH and Vanderpump Rules

Was pretty dead on a weeknight post-pride, so had my pick of a seat.  Went to the bar and had a couple of drinks .. They weren't bad, honestly better than I thought they would be, and the bartender was fun to speak with.

Got the better half a tee shirt, which was $40 but not surprising given the location and the celebrity.

"This place is so cute! Came on a Saturday night at 915pm. We had to wait a little bit because we showed up just after our reservation but getting a drink at the bar was no problem. We sat down on the covered patio and ordered a variety of entrees and appetizers from the kitchen, all of which were amazing! Only downside is that the tables are very close together so we definitely bumped into the table next to us when trying to get out and back in again.

"I come to LA for the Vanderpump experience.  I visit all of her restaurants, TomTom, SUR, and of course PUMP.   PUMP is by far, my favorite, though they are all great.   It's the ambiance of the large olive trees and lighting designed by Lisa herself.   It's the music which is at just the right level so you can have a great connection with everyone you are with, and even make a new friend.  The food never disappoints.  It's also the staff.  We had exceptional service from servers and server assistants, but the one person, other than getting to see and chat with LVP herself, that makes this special for me is Logan, who is a server here.   He's warm and genuine.  You feel like you have known him forever.   He makes me feel like special VIP, and then I look around and he is treating everyone this way!  Now I might be slightly jealous of this ;) but he is just that amazing and is an all around good guy.    He is not just my Server, but I consider him my friend.  I always ask for his section when I visit if possible.    Go enjoy the PUMP experience, and I hope you get to see Lisa and Logan and enjoy the fabulous atmosphere and food.

"The waitstaff is amazing!! Angela is fantastic! And I'll admit the hand pinched taco was tasty! (Beef with parm)  The house frozen margarita was incredibly sweet. Which I like, but the alcohol is very light. And from here on out, just NO.

The waitstaff and busser is the only reason they got 2 stars!

Do not walk, run!  The salsa was interesting. It was okay and had carrot bits in it. Odd, but I like to try new things. I got the spinach dip. The large. The most disgusting dip I've ever had. It tastes like the cheese was the cheapest they could find and I couldn't tell if the spinach was from a can or a cheap frozen brick. Other than that it was beyond bland. There was an odd taste I've had before but I couldn't even eat 1/8 without the margarita. (And sadly I will gorge on cheese dip.) So, no to the salsa, no to the spinach cheese dip, and the chips are eh. The frozen margarita, was really weak, definitely not worth $6, but sweet if that's how you like it. I do. 😊 The pinched taco... okay, I really enjoyed that! The waitstaff - someone needs to poach them!!! This place doesn't deserve them.

Edit:
The frozen margarita,  I still stand by that it is sweet, but I have more of a buzz than I realized. So the alcohol's just kind of hidden.  I will say I would indulge in another frozen Margarita here.

The ""busser"" I referred to, come to find out, is the manager. Not expected, but he was a hard worker, great personality, friendly, and very welcoming.

I will admit, he said several people commented on the dip saying it tasted weird and took it off no issues or real questions.

I personally don't plan on coming back. But if they were slow and I was bored and wanted to chat with the staff, I would eat a taco and have a margarita. If you live close by, and love to support Mom and Pop places as I do, I say give it a try and leave your experience on here. Maybe I just caught them on a really off day. Or maybe I'm a little spoiled. 🤷‍♀️",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bHJUSV9RRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/El+Sombrero+Mexican+Restaurant/@39.1558178,-94.6226482,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x87c0f8e14c6778e5:0x7a83ab0f7396465d!8m2!3d39.1970678!4d-94.5048943!16s%2Fg%2F1td0y_d5?hl=en",ChIJ5XhnTOH4wIcRXUaWcw-rg3o,Mexican restaurant,2.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM72AmD5OqeldlbLH42IE29K9ydn28fngCmEGQd=w150-h150-k-no-p

First impression...The host at the door that seated us was rude. The girl that brought our salsa and chips was also unpleasant. The food was ok however I think the menu is misleading. Tacos say it comes with guacamole but when asked was told it was an extra charge. My husband and daughter thought the shrimp tasted like Walmart brand frozen from a bag.

"Walked right in and was seated right away. They immediately brought us out chips, salsa and queso. The queso was great and the salsa had a different texture but was good. It’s rare to find places that start you off with free queso. They honestly have the best horchata I’ve had. The food had great flavor and the portions were perfect. The rice was a little dry for my liking, but I typically never eat the rice anyways. Service was great and they had refills ready to go.

The ambiance was very romantic for our wedding anniversary. The server was also very nice and helpful with the menu. I got the fillet 4oz combo with 3 bourbon maple shrimp. I was underwhelmed when I saw how small the steak looked and it was well done not medium. It was also dry and needed a sauce. The shrimp was flavorful and tasty. The sides were good but nothing to rave about. My husband got the cajan spiced pan roasted fillet which was seasoned nicely but was very clean..small portions all around.

"I wish I loved this meal, but honestly I could have had better in Boston and that's not saying much.

The baked potato was delicious and very flavorful, but the strip steak with blue cheese crust was all panko breadcrumbs and very little blue cheese. The steak was also a bit tough for the $39 price tab.

Service was also very slow. 40 minute wait for a table that never came so I sat at the bar instead and then waited another 10 minutes to have my drink request taken.

The glass of red wine I chose was out of stock, so I had to choose something different and waited another 10 minutes for someone to ask if I wanted a drink. Surprisingly, the meal came out quickly, in about 15 minutes, but having to wait nearly 1.5 hours for an okay steak and a delicious baked potato was disappointing.

House made lemonade is sour-ly delicious

Fish tacos are perfectly fried and the sauce they have in the tacos really makes it taste better.

Salad is good, but the fried croutons with it is just yum!

Veggie burger is pretty thick, has flavor but isn't too dry.  The fries are like drugs.  Once you start you can't stop.

Dessert
Chocolate bunt cake is lovely.  Perfectly moist and sweet that it doesn't overpower the vanilla ice cream.  Sweet but not super sweet.  If that makes sense.
Pumpkin pie, is really simply done without added surger.  The pie crust is wonderfully done where you can't tell where it ends and the pumpkin moose begins.

"We just had a great dinner after a day of house-hunting in Overland Park. So happy we walked in, as the staff was so friendly and knowledgeable, about not only the food, but the questions we had about the area. (Thanks, Isaac and Josh!)

We ordered the chicken tenders as an appetizer, with the delicious plum BBQ sauce, made in-house.  As much as I wanted prime rib, I settled for steak tacos and my partner ordered crabcakes.  We watched the food going out to the tables, every item seemed to be on a large plate and looked amazing.

Our service was paced perfectly, and we were happy with all items. So much flavor, very tender, and plenty of it.  Even the lemonade was fresh and delish.

We will be back. Loved it!  Although we are staying at a hotel, I included a pic of the foil wrapped taco and bag of ice from the hotel, since we are in a room without a fridge.

"Homegrown GA: where hospitality meets quality

This bustling Atlanta suburb diner has been a staple in the community for generations it seems. From the moment you pull up, you can see what to expect. Old school restaurant, friendly staff and a small but thorough menu.

Breakfast is served all day, and to be honest it’s substantial enough to carry you all day. Ask for the house special and you’ll be offered “The Comfy”. An open faced chicken biscuit with fresh sausage gravy on top. Add a side of potatoes if you like, but by no means is it necessary.

Don’t be discouraged by a wait, it moves quick and won’t leave you disappointed. Enjoy some coffee, the nostalgic signs and art that fill the walls, the friendly conversation with staff and the amazing smells coming out of the kitchen.

In short, this is a must go when in Atlanta.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdDZIaXNBRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Home+grown+GA+Restaurant/@33.8024586,-84.9197088,9z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x88f503fd3a38eb77:0xab27b394f0bc3f29!8m2!3d33.746684!4d-84.3558822!16s%2Fg%2F1trqj1bh?hl=en",ChIJd-s4Ov0D9YgRKT-88JSzJ6s,Family restaurant,5.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkB1-2ydSEevnMjqZVnyqZ2O_5Et_hfEq7xfjW=w150-h150-k-no-p
"Worth the wait. We waited outside for around 20 minutes as it drizzled. The picnic tables were shared by multiple families. The atmosphere was upbeat and friendly. Our names were announced via speaker when our table was ready. Inside is an amazing experience of Atlanta culture, that was a mix between hippie chic and yard hoarder fancy. The coffee was served piping hot so be careful! I mixed with chocolate syrup to make a mocha coffee. We enjoyed a skinny chicken plate that was served with fresh spinach which was absolutely wonderful. I favored the turkey round sausage over the chicken link sausage. My highlights are the grits and home fries which I opted to add the peppers and onions, and the pancake was big enough for the 3 of us to enjoy and tasted like heaven.

"New to Atlanta and had a friend visiting from DC this weekend so we wanted to find a good spot for breakfast and this place did not disappoint.  It’s a cute little eclectic spot with a great brunch menu.  We did have to wait 20-30 minutes for a seat but it was well worth it.  We started with fried green tomatoes which were delicious.  I had the fried chicken and waffles, the portion size was perfect and both items were very tasty.  The others with me had the biscuits and gravy, basic breakfast and fried chicken biscuit.

"Home grown is a staple in the Atlanta brunch scene. It is small and cozy, with a warm diner vibe. The food is solid and there are a lot of menu options. This is a good place to take anybody for brunch.

Their signature dish is the comfy chicken biscuit. It is an open-face biscuit with chicken and sausage gravy. This is always my go-to menu item. It is definitely comfort food.

The item my husband ordered was the standard two egg breakfast plate with eggs over easy, cheese grits, a biscuit, and bacon. The eggs, grits, and biscuit were great. The bacon was a little rubbery. We would have preferred it more well done.

Overall, the food may not be the most amazing food, but it is solid, and it is comfort food. The staff is very friendly, and have all been there for years.

"This was a nice kind of hole in the wall place. Food wise I think that the food is probably about a 3/5 for the price and level. It's a little saltier than I'd like, but I'm not a huge fan of salt. The presentation is okay as you can see in the pictures but not fantastic. But I don't remove points for that because I don't expect a restaurant of this caliber to have fantastic presentation.

The reason that I'm removing an extra point is because they only provide plastic cutlery, styrofoam cups for water and drinks, and even the plates are paper. That's very unusual for a sit down restaurant and it looks like they're trying to cut costs on a dishwasher or dishwashing stuff, but also being very non environmentally friendly. I think that's wrong and I think that really brings quality of the establishment down.

I also noticed that the Table we were seated at didn't have clean floors and still had crumbs on the chairs  Very strange and it felt kind of nasty to sit there.

"I read about this place on a blog entitled, ""Best Sandwiches for each State"". I like chicken, love pimento cheese and garden to table always sells me, so I had to try this place out.

The diner was decorated like in the 60s sandwich shop fashion and our waiter was friendly.

I had the chicken and pimento cheese sandwich. The cheese was more of a sauce than a pimento cheese spread. Very cheddary and creamy. It was really good.

They serve on paper plates with plastic utensils. Problem is the plastic knife was made of such thin plastic it bend when trying to cut the chicken. It wouldn't cut so I had to pull the meat apart with my fingers.. The store owner really needs to purchase better cutlery.

They make folks wear mask (even if you are vaccinated) until you arrive at your table where you can take the mask off. However they don't space tables out. People were sitting back to back in booths.. I guess germs don't get on you if you are sitting at your table, but will jump on you if you get up without a mask on. I rather have distancing than wearing a mask.

"Absolute BEST Brunch We've Had!!

Overall: after a visit in the ATL, we had a choice of many great options for brunch and we settled on HomeGrown. It was fantastic!! They have such an eclectic and unique menu that it's difficult to choose. Customer service is super friendly and helpful and the food is amazing. Good bit of space inside and patio. Definitely gets busy, but they keep service throughout. Parking on site is a very needed bonus.

Food: creative and unique menu that's tough to choose. Tempted many times by other items , but went with the comfy chicken sandwich. It is an open faced fried chicken on a biscuit with pork gravy. I know this is a BIG statement, but it is the BEST chicken sandwich with gravy I've ever had! It was seasoned perfectly and pro gravy was fantastic. The biscuit was awesome as well. No need for salt, pepper, or hot sauce at all. B got the hot steak biscuit, complete with hot sauce and a pickle on a tasty biscuit. Also had to get the home fries with onions, chilli, cheese and carrots. Amazing!! Coffee could use a little work, but I'm reaching here.

Interior/Exterior/Scene: awesome deco with city vibe including stickers of local places, music, and abound with unique paintings and overall decor. Large counter space if you want to skip the wait, which we did. Large patio with outside eating and large amount of parking for an in-city spot.

Service: was great, friendly, and super attentive. Our waiter at the counter was awesome!!

"THIS PLACE IS A MUST
There's usually a 45 minute wait and parking can be complicated so keep that in mind but it's worth it! I live in the neighborhood and always pass this place and see how packed it is so I decided to come for brunch with my girlfriends.

The service is amazing! This place really makes you feel like home, great energy from staff as well as patrons. We were waiting for two people in our party to come and I was nervous that they wouldn't seat us but the staff did not have a problem with it at all and did not make us feel pressured to order when we were waiting probably 30 minutes for our other friend to show up. Thank you! Because a lot of other places would not do that

Best biscuits in Atlanta hands down! There are a few pictures attached of our food as well! I ordered the Lynn special and it doesn't look that great in my picture but WOW it was amazing. Two hearty salmon cakes over fried green tomatoes, topped with pimento cheese, all over a bed of spinach and tomatoes. The green tomatoes were fried to perfection!

"A group of friends and I had brunch here during our first morning in Atlanta. There's not much that needs to be said other than the fact that our visit was the best way to start our vacation.

We were quickly seated and had friendly, amazing server. The environment had a very artsy feel to it (almost like a brunch spot fused with an antiques shop, but there were no antique items). Our server made us feel welcomed and even made suggestions for us during our Atlanta visit.

The food was the best of the best. I ordered the Skinny Chicken with a pancake on the side. The entree came with grilled chicken, spinach, and egg whites. Healthy as can be and it didn't taste overly salty. The pancake was phenomenal and the best part of it all.  It came with powdered sugar and was basically a homemade pancake.

"Love the atmosphere! I can honestly say that when we pulled up I had no idea what to expect.  At all. There were a lot of cars outside..I thought a long wait was ahead of us. We walked in and we're immediately seated in the back part of the rather large dining room. The ambiance of this place is amazing!  For the first five minutes I sat, looking around in awe. A very diverse staff as well as customer base. I love that literally everyone approaches you as if they have known you forever. Southern hospitality at its best. On the walls the art work of local artists hang with the price tags ready for purchase.  We sat in the back where there is what looks to be a small thrift store. A really cool addition to the place. This restaurant is suitable for families, just a couple of friends out to eat, or a couple looking for a nice chill place.

The menu literally has something for everyone. There are so many things that I wanted to try so I just randomly picked one today! Everything is reasonably priced with the taxes included in the price that is listed. You definitely get your money's worth as the portions are pretty big. Almost 2 servings per order. Did I mention they sell breakfast all day! SCORE!

As for my food, I ordered the chef's omelet  with veggie sausage added and a pancake for my side.  My food was pretty good. The goat cheese probably threw it off a little for me though. In sticking to southern food traditions my omelet was also pretty heavy with butter or oil.  The spinach, tomatoes,  and mushrooms were sauteed perfectly. The pancake was as big as the plate.  I seriously only ate half of it and asked for a to go box for the other half. It was thick and fluffy. Very good. My boyfriend got a simple breakfast with scrambled eggs , cheese grits, bacon, Turkey sausage, and a biscuit. His food looked really good as well.

Overall...I loved it! I'll definitely go back here often! The only thing I HATED....I left my to go pancake box on the table. By the time I got to the register and realized it was too late. I went right back and our table had already been turned and was clean.

"(11/21/20 visit) Got the salmon patty biscuit, side of eggs with vegetables, French toast and fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. The only non- great item was the biscuit. It's not that it tasted bad but it was HEAVY. Like dense. The salmon patties were flavored great and the breading gave it the perfect crunch. The eggs were well cooked and fluffy. The French toast was amazing. Perfect amount of sweety and savory. The fresh squeezed grapefruit juice was refreshing. Tasted natural and fresh. Customer service was excellent.

The establishment was clean and neatly decorated with Ethiopian based art. It was nicely lit for small group/small family style dining. They even have a bar. There were only 2 other dine-in parties seated when our group arrived. They were seated completely separate from each other and by the time we got our meals, we were the only diners there. Our service was kind and they answered any questions that we had. The food was delicious, especially the beef tibs, the shrimp dish, and the curried lentils!

"Really love the concept! Some of the dishes were tasty while others were okay nothing too fancy,
If you are super hungry this type of style restaurant would be best bet as when you get seated you can start eating your food if you see anything you like on the conveyor belt.

We had appetizers and some decent sushi.
Some of the faves were:
Golden Sushi Roll
Tiger Roll
Texan Roll
Spicy Popcorn Roll
Shrimp Avocado Roll
CHEESECAKE

Inari was a little different but not too bold or sweet (neutral)
I gave it 3 stars because:
Cleanliness of the restaurant, it was a little smelly (outside of the raw food), even outside the restaurant.
We weren’t treated as a new customer, we were so lost until we had to flag down a waiter to help us understand and even then, we had to read over the instructions which are on the belt of how to order and how to take off plates on conveyor belt. We did eventually figure it out.
Lastly, their drinks options are very limited-  their tea (green) was not your typical tea it was not great - so we stuck with water.

Food is good. Sad they never brought the banana tempura back. My issue is the rise in price over the years. I remember when the plates were a little over $2 each. Now, its almost $4. The ramen used to be about $5, now it's $10. Ridiculous price for a little bowl! We used to spend around $50, but now our total is $80, for less food! It's just not worth eating here anymore.

I love coming here when I crave sushi. The revolving machine with different sushi is an experience itself. Everytime you finish your sushi you can put your plate inside the area they have next to you table and a video will play. Because of COVID19 they are not doing that at the moment but you can order the sushi you want and they'll send it to you on a conveyor.

"Love this place. The sushi 🍣 always tastes fresh AF. You can sit down and immediately start grabbing food off the rotating belt or order off the touch screen above you. If you order food of the touch screen it always arrives quickly, the dishes are consistently very tasty and always presented well. There's only been one dish I didn't like in the ten+ times I've been here... it was the fried squid or calamari dish. It was way over cooked and very rubbery. My favorite dishes are the rainbow and caterpillar rolls. I also really enjoy the hand rolls... They are probably the best deals in my opinion. The desserts are also really good, my favorite is the Fried banana 🍌. A must try if you're a fan of bananas. The fried donuts to me is a little over rated and not very impressive but still 'aight. The cheese cake is yummy and if the mochi wasn't frozen solid as a rock when I tried it I'd probably have enjoyed it more. The staff is always very friendly and there's always employees around to help if you have questions. I just hope they get a beer and wine license soon!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBbktmU3VnRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Kura+Revolving+Sushi+Bar/@29.7398268,-95.3786331,13z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8640bf6e6c0a0a03:0xe0d4a91e7918564a!8m2!3d29.7394979!4d-95.3792165!16s%2Fg%2F11hbms5vqq?hl=en",ChIJAwoKbG6_QIYRSlYYeR6p1OA,Conveyor belt sushi restaurant,5.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRYvGzDiHNeQjDrN9pe44DiruptmdZlvTJw8-u=w150-h150-k-no-p
"Returned during COVID-19 and had a pleasant experience. Conveyor service is stopped — definitely the right move for everyone’s safety. All plates are made to order, and honestly i think the quality is fresher (you can already tell i loved ordering fresh— see below). The prep time can be longer than just grabbing from the conveyor belt, but for the safety and the freshness, i can take it!!
Menu-wise, i prefer all the belly (toro?) sushi to regular sushi. Their tamago is COLD - didn’t expect that... you should ask for wasabi and soysauce. Udon was decently good - i think better value than miso soup. Oh, i like mackerel as well, but it might be too fishy(?) for some people.

"Kura offers an intuitive way to be served.  Food items make their rounds by each table on a conveyor.  You grab and lift plates of your choosing then once you're done, you'll place your empty plate into a slot.  Each plate from the line is $2.35 and the majority come with two pieces of sushi.  There are special items too such as snow crab legs (one piece), sushi bowls, desserts, and sea urchin (an acquired taste).  Once you deposit 15 plates, you get a prize like a lanyard, stickers, small figurines.

If it is your first time there, the server will ask you then inform you briefly how to get your meal.  Speaking of the servers...  I know this isn't your ritzy 5 star restaurant, but they could use a little more time with their uniform.  I noticed some whose uniforms were untucked, wrinkled, and sloppy overall.  At an authentic Japanese restaurant, they take pride in the way they present themselves.  In their culture it is a show of respect for their patrons.

Overall, the experience was okay because I went on a Monday.  By the time I got there much of the plates on the line were empty.  Oh, you can place separate orders for hot items like soups, ramen, tempura, desserts, etc.  Those arrive at your table on a different line.  Once they get to you, please pick up your order.  If you don't, it will stop the line.  One group wasn't aware and they didn't pick up their order.  So my guest had to walk over to that table to let them know.  Pretty sure that is the server's job to ensure the line doesn't get held up.  But, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwbklfNGpBRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Kura+Revolving+Sushi+Bar/@29.7398268,-95.3786331,13z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8640bf6e6c0a0a03:0xe0d4a91e7918564a!8m2!3d29.7394979!4d-95.3792165!16s%2Fg%2F11hbms5vqq?hl=en",ChIJAwoKbG6_QIYRSlYYeR6p1OA,Conveyor belt sushi restaurant,4.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1SPYih3LGksyKwvCdLBbdURYrhJHOZ5b4iSgR=w150-h150-k-no-p
"My daughter took me for father's day. Between the two of us we had to force ourselves to get that 30th plate so my daughter could win a prize.
I loved everything about the place. Small portions so if you did not like something you were not wasting food. With the rice you fill up fast.
Perfect for anyone who has always wanted to try sushi but is afraid of the price for something you may not like. 30 plates, 2 drinks, cost us $77 and that's cheap for good tasting sushi.
For those who carry a firearm openly they do not have any signs, although you may be asked to sit toward the back. That's okay because it's more private for conversation and you won't be forgotten. If you need something just hit a button to call a server.

The concept is really cool. You arrive and you can order a table on their entrance screen or wait for a host to seat you. At the table, you can use the screen to order anything from the menu and have it arrive to you table via conveyer belt or you can grab anything from the bottom conveyer belt for $2.25.

"This place is super unique. Not only is it a revolving conveyor belt sushi spot (which reminds me of Japan), but it has made to order foods on a self-service kiosk! You also insert your plate in a slot to keep track of your bill and total. You win a little toy prize if you get 15 (probably not worth it, but it's fun!) My only gripe is that this place does not serve very fresh ingredients... the fish quality is mediocre, and I DON'T recommend the Uni on ANY of the rolls.

"The tuna handrolls and the Wasabi are the best here. Rice is not done right, sushi falls apart when you pick it up instead of holding together. Skip the miso soup.. half a cup for 4$ and had a strange flavor. Hardly any sushi is replenished on the conveyor belt. System is flawed several sushi rolls we didn't order arrived on our side. Waited over 25 minutes for scallops to arrive. One server shook his head when asked for more Wasabi and green tea. Only 3 servers for an entire lunch rush.  It's too bad this place doesn't have its service and execution in order else it would be a fun concept. Unfortunately the hour and a half it took for us to have lunch was a little much.

"Wandered down here on a Tuesday evening thanks to sushi cravings. We walked in with no wait (but I have passed by this place on the weekends and see people in their waiting area). Once in a booth, the waitress came over and explained to us how it works. It’s actually a really cool concept - almost all the sushi comes on black plates. There are 2-3 pieces (depending on what you get - you get to see it as it comes around) and are $2.50. There are some special dishes which are more than $2.50 but they have an iPad menu which shows all the prices. There is a slot you can put your plates away and will count how many black plates you have. Also, if you order the more expensive plates, the iPad keeps track of that too. You can order anything though on the iPad (even if it is on the revolving convey) and it comes out within 2-5 minutes. They have some great options of fish, beef and a few vegetarian (very few though). My favorite was the Kura roll, garlic salmon ponzu and shrimp avocado. The quality was good but it was a little frustrating if you go in a group more than 2-3, you would have to get multiples of dishes and they do add up.

My favorite here is their seared scallops and seared salmon. When you finish your 16th plate, you get a surprise ball, automatically! (Kinda like a toy from Dave and Busters you get after getting enough tickets)

If you notice that your favorite plate gets picked up so quickly or doesn't reach you, you have the option to choose and make a special order on their touch screen.

Probably one the best buffet deals you can find in MN. Piles of aromatic rice pilafs. Really fresh and tasty desserts. Not quite traditional pistachio baklava, but baklava-shaped with creamy gooey ness inside.

There were tons of stews but I really like okra so I downed the okra stew. Also the giant potatoes with sauce was great.

Service was great - down to earth and friendly. The decor is as it should be: diner-like without the fru fru extras. Mostly tables and standard stackable chairs.

"Exceptional. We started out for Glam Doll Donuts, saw a Mexican bakery (Marissa's) down the street and got distracted. By the time we bought our Mexican pastries, it was lunchtime and Marhaba was across the intersection.

Understand one thing about Marhaba and you will fare much better there: don't expect much from their ""American"" food (looking at you, fried chicken wings). Everything else is very, very good. They do a Mediterranean buffet better than The Marina a few miles north. I didn't think that was possible and here I sit full an so very much corrected.

Things I needed seconds of (some of which I had, some of which I was too full to do again): baklava, catfish, lamb Kafka, tabouleh, gyro meat, meat samosa.

$42 for 2 adults and 2 preschoolers on some mysterious pay per year of the child's age system. So probably somewhere around $15/person with a soda. If the quality of the Mediterranean food wasn't so high, I would have dropped a star for the price.

This place is known for its Mediterranean fare, hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli, Gyros, sambusas, grilled chicken, roast chicken, Kafka, pot roast, BBQ rib tips, arguably some of the best mashed potatoes, three kinds of seasoned rice, countless other dishes. You need to bring an appetite, and expect to overeat if you plan on going with the all-you-can-eat buffet option. A more practical and dietary way, is to make your selections ala carte to go, even if you just sit down and eat. That way you take a measured amount, it controls the overeating, and it's more frugal. Mohammed doesn't mind either way, DIY card method means you're less likely to waste food, and as a Muslim, wasting food is considered a sign of disrespect for the gift of the meal, from Allah.

"I went here on valentines with my partner for a date!! The food was delicious and the atmosphere was really enjoyable. It was our first time coming here and we both had a nice experience. It's a very cozy feel inside. We had reservations and got there about 3 mins early, they seated us quickly and gave us our menus and some bread. The customer service was really great. When walking to the restroom there's a big door to open into the hallway and a waiter nearby actually opened it for me, which I found very polite. The only complaint I have is that me and my bf both got steaks but our waitress didn't ask us how we wanted them cooked, my partner quicky told her how he wanted his cooked before she walked off after taking our order. Sadly, I didn't get to tell her how I wanted mine prepared since she walked off so quickly so overall my steak was cooked well done, which I didn't enjoy but it didn't ruin the taste of the steak too much for me. Regardless of the steak not being prepared to my liking, I would definitely come back to this restaurant!!

"Although I wasn't very familiar with Ethiopian cuisine, I had a great time at this restaurant. The food was absolutely delicious, and the price was very fair, especially considering that we ordered a platter for four people and couldn't even finish it! My friend really enjoyed the mango smoothie, but I found it a bit too sweet and heavy. The one downside was that the restaurant was very busy, and they occasionally forgot to bring our additional orders. Also, they charged us the wrong amount, so it's important to double-check your tab during checkout.

"Came for the Tuesday deal. Was told it would be 20-30min wait for leagues and parties to end. However, league doesn’t end until 9pm and about 3/4 of the lanes are dedicated to league games. We ended up waiting over and hour to bowl. Our issue is they knew league wouldn’t end until 9 and they gave us a complete unrealistic waiting time. Also multiple lanes (many next to each other) were completely open but they wouldn’t allow anyone to bowl next to league games. This is incredibly frustrating for local patrons who want to take advantage of their weekly deals. So disappointing. Also if you plan to have a night with a lot of people at the bar it would be nice to have more then one bartender to serve drinks took forever to get anything

"The Denver Zoo is one of the best zoos I've been to. I would give it third place - behind only San Diego & the National Zoo. It's a very big zoo for being right in the city,  with easy access from downtown and 25. Admission is incredibly reasonable and is a better deal than the aquarium.  The enclosures are great and the animals seem very well cared for.  We did a ""behind the scenes"" with birds of pretty and it was excellent!

"First time doing the Denver Zoo light spectacular and it was absolutely remarkable. I love how they spread out different themes throughout the park ie: makes it look like you're walking through the ocean and another part like you're walking through the jungle. Over 1 million lights! Getting the glow pass and the zoo it all pass are great additions! The glow pass gives you 3-D glasses that are VERY fun & unique to view all the lights! That pass also gives you a nice insulated souvenir cup.  The Zoo it all pass gives you unlimited rides on the train,  carousel and 4-D show which is perfect for families of all ages.

"Really enjoyed this zoo. It was compact, walkable and had a wide range of species. Staff was friendly, ticket rates were reasonable ($15 for adults).

Located near Denver city park, it’s a short 5 min walk from the interesting musuem of science and nature which is yet another worthwhile attraction in this area. There’s ample parking here if you are renting a car, otherwise it’s pretty accessible via ride-based apps as well.

They have a number of lions and penguins greeting you as you enter and then a plenitude of primates likes orangutans, chimpanzees and gorillas waving at you from their large enclosures. Animals are well looked after here like in other zoos in LA, Oakland and San Diego and have a good amount of space to wander about so let your conscience not bother you for indulging at their price.

"We haven't been here in about a year and so much has changed! It was a great zoo before, but even better now. Plan to spend quite some time there. My daughter and I were just there for two hours and didn't get to see everything! It got too close to closing time lol. Will go earlier next time (went at 230 on a Saturday). The exhibits the animals are staying in are amazing. I was especially impressed with the elephant and giraffe houses. The way the place is set up and designed is awesome. And you can tell the care takers are really great and take loving care of their animals.

Random tips: We took our own water bottles. There are water bottle filling stations throughout the zoo so you don't have to purchase drinks if you don't want to. There is a water spray station for the kiddos if they get too hot. Some of the indoors exhibits are also air conditioned. Lots of places to rest or just observe the animals. I will say parking is tight when it's busy, so if you make a reservation, give yourself plenty of time to find parking. The garage is free and has four levels, elevators take a minute, walk the stairs if you're trying to get to the entrance for a reservation. City Park is also right next to the zoo and has an awesome play ground and places to picnic. Masks are not required, but some guests do wear them. I wore one because I'm high risk and was fine. Can't wait to go back! Hope the avian bird flu passes soon so the birds can come out, but gotta keep all the animals safe ❤️.

*Our passes were free through Denver Public Library. You have to make the reservations ahead of time online. I believe the prices are $20 for adults and $15 for kids 3 - 11, otherwise.

"They labeled the enclosures well plus added many warning signs to protect the public. There were many areas to sit down and rest as well as to eat and refresh yourself. The animals were entertaining especially the Gibbons monkeys and Silverback Gorilla.  The cost of a 2-12oz bottle of Coca-Cola and 2-soft pretzels cost us $23.82. It was ridiculously expensive and I hope some of that goes to take care of the animals.

"Very nice zoo. Last zoo we were at was in Bronx, NYC right before covid shut it down in 2020.

Unfortunately for humans, but good for animals, the birds d/t avian flu circulating were out of main display.

Several exhibits were closed for renovations.

The ticketing online did give a heads-up though. On that note, the timed entry thing is a bit annoying. I don’t know how it prevents covid spreading 2.5 years into this when people still crowd each other at the exhibits anyway. Also, it looked like you could actually buy a ticket at the zoo on the kiosk but not sure if they were really working.

"We decided to treat the kids to a family fun Sunday. It was a little chilly but not unbearable.  Staff was very helpful and gave my daughter some Birthday coupons , there was employees all over the park who was telling us about the animals. Due to the cold weather and a few enclosures that are being built some animals weren't around to be seen like the gorillas, birds, and sting ray cove which is some of our favorite places to visit . We love to feed the stingrays and the birds. But we did get to get pretty close to some beautiful giraffes with their long necks they were passing the barrier and we could almost reach out to them. Tons of great animals to see and to learn about . One of our new favorite things to do is walking through their animal hospital if you get to the zoo early enough you might see some Vet tech going on in the viewing windows. We got to see the lemurs getting fed .  Defiantly will be going back when it's a little warmer to see the bears and gorillas out.

"I've been to two zoos in the U.S. Washington D.C. zoo and the Denver zoo. Here are the reasons why I think Denver zoo is superior.

The zoo has a pretty well planned layout that makes sense. I like the decision to keep the animals from the same regions together in the same pans as you might find them in nature which I didn't see in DC zoo. Denver zoo has more rides than D.C. and as a full grown adult, I still wished I could ride the cool train. The number of empty/unavailable exhibits are also fewer, most had animals in them while D.C. one had a lot of empty exhibits for different reasons. Themes and vibes created for the areas through building styles and music are also quite incredible around the zoo.

Why do I rate 4 stars?

D.C. zoo is free and Denver zoo is $20 for general admission. In value comparison, it's probably even, if D.C. zoo isn't better. $20 would price out a lot of families. $5 ~ $10 range would totally push it to 5 starts imo.

If you're fine with the entry fee, I'd 100% recommend it as a must-visit place for families visiting/living in Denver.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2Z3JlR0hREAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Denver+Zoo/@39.7167041,-104.9604587,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x876c794e20258f71:0x53fd0ed23d876c29!8m2!3d39.7501637!4d-104.948953!16zL20vMGN5bnhk?hl=en",ChIJcY8lIE55bIcRKWyHPdIO_VM,Zoo,4.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNa-I4N_t8JvzjB4LdDmAhRjEW6Dq2epoGnTtmD=w150-h150-k-no-p

I’ve been going to the Denver Zoo my entire life and before I wouldn’t have given such a high review. The enclosures use to be so small and crowded but they have been working really hard recently to update and expand all enclosures. The service over the year has improved. The biggest downside right now is with COVID you have to select a time slot to go and there aren’t as many zookeepers walking around or have as many stations set up where you can learn more about the different animals.

"My wife and I had traveled to Denver because it houses The Children's Hospital Colorado, and we got free passes since we stayed at the Ronald McDonald House of Denver, so we went! And may I just say, the Zoo itself was extremely clean, well-maintained, and full of people excited to see the wonderful animals there! We spent about a total of 4 hours just walking around, looking at the entirety of various animals that they had there. The day we went, it was a little cold, so they had most of the animals inside their habitats that were shielded from the cold, but were still able to roam freely.

The Denver Zoo is a pretty nice zoo. It is a long day if you are going to go through the whole thing to see all of the animals. Food is pretty expensive so if you want to save a little money I would suggest bringing a water bottle and some snacks.

"Denver Zoo is an 80 acre zoological garden in City Park of Denver, Colorado. Founded in 1896, it is the most popular paid attraction in the Denver metropolitan area.

Denver Zoo was started with the donation of an orphaned American black bear. With the construction of Bear Mountain, it became the first zoo in the United States to use naturalistic zoo enclosures rather than cages with bars. It expanded on this concept with Primate Panorama, featuring huge mesh tents and open areas for apes and monkeys, and with Predator Ridge, which has three separate areas through which animals are rotated so that their overlapping scents provide environmental enrichment. Toyota Elephant Passage, which opened on June 1, 2012, is divided into five areas for rotating the various species.

The zoo achieved ISO 14001 certification in 2009, was given the first AZA Green Award in 2011, and was named the ""Greenest Zoo in the Country"" at the World Renewable Energy Forum in 2012. In 2015, it was re-certified for ISO 14001 and achieved OHSAS 18001 certification, becoming only the fourth zoo in the world to get both certifications.

Denver Zoo houses species from all over the world, including hoofed mammals, carnivorous mammals, primates, pachyderms, birds, reptiles, and fish. The zoo's animal collection contains 3,500 specimens representing 550 unique species. The zoo is laid out in a large loop, with exhibits both inside and outside the loop",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyd0pMeHdnRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Denver+Zoo/@39.7167041,-104.9604587,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x876c794e20258f71:0x53fd0ed23d876c29!8m2!3d39.7501637!4d-104.948953!16zL20vMGN5bnhk?hl=en",ChIJcY8lIE55bIcRKWyHPdIO_VM,Zoo,5.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcAEvKvJgmk5EcZqcesr1VH9GQFTGKpfe5X7Vw=w150-h150-k-no-p

"Always purchase tickets in advance. They no longer have a ticket window but just have kiosks. However, since tickets are timed entry and limited to a certain number of people, there have been days where they sell out all together.
The food selections are pretty standard for a place like this (hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken fingers, fries, soft serve ice cream including the Dole Whip like they have at the Disney Parks, and stands for pretzels, beer, Dippin' Dots, popcorn (extremely salty), and cotton candy to name a few).
The long standing staple at the zoo, The Bird House, is closed and looks to be slated for demolition or huge renovation. I will miss that place. The old ""Cat House"" has been closed for a couple years now and it's not obvious what they're going to do with it. But there are many changes coming in the future. I just hope it's not too seriously delayed from Covid-19.
My new favorites are the Painted Wild Dogs. They are very interested in the people and what they want. One growled at my husband because it was challenging the direct eye contact. I love so many of the animals there but I deeply miss the Red Pandas. I hope they bring some in soon.
Another favorite thing about the Denver Zoo is the beautiful gardens. The cacti are gorgeous and the seasonal switch of flowers throughout the park is so well done.

The zoo is over 80 acres and practices animal conservation. Not saying there isn't room for improvement there is always room for improvement. This is a great zoo. They serve great food too.

Stingray Cove is a must see and not over priced to enter or feed the animals.
Fun little cabana next to it with tacos and margaritas.
No one under 16 can feed or enter the stingray exhibit without an adult present.
Always recommend getting a year pass if your a local. Save yourself some money and keep this wonderful zoo well funded. (7/17/21)

Beautiful exhibits, staff is very friendly and helpful with answering questions.

Recommend getting a year pass-%10 off food and drinks, %20 off souvenir shops.

At the brewery stands purchase the souvenir glass and that combined with your year pass gets your drink cheaper and it’s worth it! It’s pricey the first time because you are purchasing the glass, but when you bring it with you for your next beer it’s cheaper.

Purchase the souvenir soda cup for around $5 and then your refills are around $1.50.

You can pack in lunches and find plenty of places to sit and eat.

Parking is a little snug since it is next to the museum and if the museum is packed unfortunately some people come and park at the zoo and walk over to the museum. Taking spots away from people trying to go to the zoo.

The zoo was very nice. All the animals were out. The reason I'm giving three stars is because we had a giraffe feeding that I paid extra for and they said that we missed it when I know I scheduled it for two o'clock. So they don't do refunds they offered us to feed the camels. I have to say that was not very exciting and anyway shape or form. I know they do their best to take care of their animals with the animals were very dirty. At first they weren't letting us feed the camels. The worker was just feeding and talking. I'm like do we get to feed them she's like well no and I'm like okay that's what we paid for. So I think me and my two friends were able to give them each two snacks.

"I've been coming to this zoo for years and the changes they have been making to the exhibits are beautiful. The elephant pavilion in particular feels like you're transported to a different place and the landscaping throughout the zoo is next level and worth a visit alone with beautiful flowers and plants and art installations everywhere.

The food offerings are so incredibly threadbare, however. With covid you can only walk in one direction through the zoo and it literally took us an hour to get to a restaurant that served something other than greasy beer fries or nachos or grilled cheese. I don't think there's a single green salad for sale in the entire zoo. In addition, online ordering was down so there was a very slow ""one family at the indoor register at a time"" process in place which could be improved by allowing orders through the app. The food we did have tasted good however.

"Visited 10/26
First time visit, the zoo is beautiful. We visited right after a big snow a lot of the animals were moved and a lot of the park was closed due to COVID. We still had a great time walking around and seeing those animals that were out. The lego build of animals were also pretty cool. They did have the gift shop and some food places open. There was not many people at all and felt like we had the zoo to ourselves.

"Love the Denver Zoo. It's been a while since I went to the zoo, however it never disappoints. Lots of ongoing construction, but always worth the price of admission. Seems like there are exhibits that are closed, but enough other exhibits are open to enjoy the experience. Manage expectations. I wanted to see polar bears and the reptiles but the bears were still hibernating 😴 and the reptile exhibit was closed (or gone) for construction.  I dont think they're doing up close with the animal opportunities with covid restrictions.  Denver Zoo manages covid very well. Limited visitors and open paths. Being mindful, avoiding confined spaces and wearing my mask to help prevent infections and help everyone got me through. Other guests at the zoo were pretty mindful of my personal space. Overall worth the trip. Be mindful I have no kids and ate before I went. I did buy some water there, but this was a cheap excursion for me. WEAR CONFORTABLE WALKING SHOES.

"I have grown up with this Zoo and I am super grateful they have been able to figure out how to operate regardless of the current conditions. Contact less tickets online, guaranteeing you a time slot to enter the park and also a low stress parking experience when you arrive. They have one way easy arrows that help you navigate through the park, and you have the option to take the full trip or half trip. It's lovely to have the option, especially since they give you estimated times for each route. Even though there are still closed exhibits, they have a new stingray exhibit where you can touch them!!

The babies were soooo cute and playful. I was quite impressed with this zoo. They have several yummy food and beer options with food huts in various places throughout the zoo. There was food ranging from Korean - Mexican - American. We got bison tacos from a food truck that was parked inside the zoo! It was delicious! Will try the Korean food next time.

The animals looked very well taken care of. We watched penguins hop about and swim. There were even an elephant and sea lion presentation. The elephant was free to roam in and out during the informational presentation, but he stayed the whole time and even gave the crowd a few poses without prompting. We couldn't stay for the sea lion presentation, so will have to do that next time. This zoo was very clean and the smells were not bad at all. I'm sensitive to odors and was able to handle the whole zoo. There was an area where some monkeys could swing on ropes right above us as they cross from one area to another.

"Perty cool design on buildings and animal enclosures. Due to covid 19 they have made a giant path you have to follow and stay on around the park and alot of things are closed. You have to use their website to get tix and QR barcodes to order any food but the gift shop is open with a path to follow inside as well. You have to keep masks on the whole time. They do have hand sanitizer all around as well.
There is only a certain amount of tix sold for each time slot throughout the day. They are supposed to let each group through in 15 min increments but this was not followef when we went and there were big clusters of people not following the 6ft rule anywhere or keeping masks on or on their kids as well.

"We went towards the end of the free day which is an amazing offer to get to go for no admission price, but we also didn't get to see many animals, in fact, the most animals that were around were inside the tropical discovery building meaning we mostly saw fish, reptiles, and amphibians. Don't get me wrong, the tropical discovery is a cool area, but we didn't get to see any elephants, lions, hippos, or the rhino. The hyenas, giraffes, zebras, and the tiger we're about the only mammals we saw. Oh, and the seals who didn't seem to mind the cold. It was awesome but honestly I'm glad we didn't make a whole day of it like we had planned, we saw all the animals that were outside in the hour, hour and a half we were there. My girlfriend was really disappointed not to see any elephants since that's her favorite animal, maybe we went too late? Not sure the reason, but there wasn't much activity. We'll try again on another free day, definitely not worth paying the normal pricey admission fee in my own opinion. As you can see from the photos, the zebras looked like sad horses in a pen (while I know they are essentially just horses, it would've been nice to see them in more of a natural setting not a farm setting eating grass out of metal horse feeders; that just looks very farm-y to me).

There is also a family restroom and many baby changing  stations. Water from the fountains tasted alright but was not very cool. We weren't too impressed with the bears. I have seen zoos with better polar bear and penguin exhibits. In all its a nice zoo. Expect parking to be a hassle. But isn't it everwhere in Denver.

"Went to the Denver Zoo with my son on an 18 hour layover to Arizona, the zoo allowed us to check our backpacks in a secure area in the Welcome Center so we didn't have to lug them around all day. The staff were extremely nice and helpful when needed, they immediately directed to hurry and see the new cub as we got there late in the day and they wanted us to see it. The exhibits were pretty and the animals were more than taken care of (have been to a few zoo's where the animals and exhibits looked as though they weren't being taken care of). I wish we didn't get there so late in the day so we could have taken our time a little more, but it was still a good day spent with plenty to see!

"Great Zoo, it’s a large 80 acres. Has a lot of animals to see plus a 4D theater that was a lot of fun. The theater is a separate cost, $6 each. There is also a railroad that is also a separate cost to ride. The enclosures are a little small but the zoo was built in 1896 so keep that in mind, they are doing a lot of renovations to make them larger. There are a lot of things for kids to do and the employees are very friendly. There is an elephant show as well.

It was covid time (6/30/2020 @345p) and the staff was friendly and making sure social distancing was in place. Everything had signage of high touch areas (meaning you probably DON'T wanna touch) and sanitizer for your hands. You are kinda corralled through the park. My advice would be go earlier than later. The baby lions ect are going to go to 'bed' at 230pm. So many times i quoted the line from Jurassic park about the lack of animals on the tour. I got some good shots and it was better than I expected.

"I loved the play and splash area!  I wish I had known about it sooner. There is a Denver Zoo App with a map to help ease but it lacks a logo to specify children interactive areas such as the sand play area, jump like an animal etc. They have a whole play area for children, toddlers and up. The new Dinosaur exhibits are awesome and we hope they're here to stay, or at least come back next summer!! They have a dig for bones activity and a dinosaur to climb on by the carousel. They also have a whole parakeet section where you can go in and feed the birds. I wish they had a place you could feed the giraffes.

Boo at the Zoo is always a hit, we love the chapstick (only Toyota was handing out the chapstick this year). The light at the Zoo has severely improved since the last time I attended in 2011. There are so many more lights and fun events etc.

FYI you cannot bring balloons into the zoo, but you can bring food, snacks, juice boxes, and water. Food isn’t too expensive nor disgusting if you have to buy here too.

"A lion was inches away from me. That's what happened late yesterday afternoon when I visited the Denver Zoo. The great-bodied, long-maned lion, with his large yellow eyes and massive paws, was only inches away... although, luckily, he was behind strong glass.  There was no one else around. I heard the faint voices of children calling from afar, but I was by myself. The lion, however, was not alone. He lay on a large rock near a brother, with another a bit farther off. They were still with a mysterious feline stillness. Twice, the nearest lion turned slowly his head slowly to look in my eyes, and then turned back again. I sat watching for a long time. A few flakes of snow drifted down, and the  breeze began to rise, but these changes were ignored by the big cats. They remained still, like monuments, like myths.

I think they were waiting for supper. Perhaps they were simply waiting for a door to be opened to allow them inside. I felt lucky to be able to wait with them, for a time. And to be able to be so close, near enough to mark their breathing.

Zoos are complicated and paradoxical. They certainly offer preservation and education, but they participate in captivity, one of the worst of human behaviors. The frequently garish displays of commercialism are also quite bothersome. Of course, I'm personally just as conflicted. I can feel immensely sad during some zoo visits, but it's also deeply meaningful to be able to approach animals that I would otherwise never see in real life.

In this review, I've given the zoo three stars, despite my wonderful experience with the lions, because the rest of my visit was marred by the awful holiday music blaring near most (but not all) of the exhibits. This was an afternoon visit, remember. The zoo would close at 5:00 and then reopen a half hour later for the annual Zoo Lights event. During my afternoon at the zoo, Christmas music was continuous, and continuously distracting. Holiday music has its place - during the evening Zoo Lights event, presumably - but otherwise please let me hear the call of the peacocks, or the sound an elephant's foot makes as it slides along the path.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJdloyMGVnEAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Denver+Zoo/@39.7167041,-104.9604587,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x876c794e20258f71:0x53fd0ed23d876c29!8m2!3d39.7501637!4d-104.948953!16zL20vMGN5bnhk?hl=en",ChIJcY8lIE55bIcRKWyHPdIO_VM,Zoo,4.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOO7uIAiDyfxDbb9mGnm2G0yElqJG94bwhBqrVK=w150-h150-k-no-p

"We had a great outing at the zoo today. First time I’d been, it was a sizeable establishment and we walked about 3 miles total with all the little side trails( you could cut it in Half if you wanted/needed).  We were there about 3 hours with a toddler and stroller, there also seemed to be a good amount of people but it really didn’t feel overcrowded or like people were pushing to the front to see the animals. The exhibits were set up nicely with multiple viewing locations, many also had indoor/covered viewing as well as outside. It was nice to see the animals seemed to have a lot of space and weren’t forced on display. There were quite a few animals we did not see (it may have been a seasonal thing with the exhibit closed) or maybe they were taking a nap somewhere- but we didn’t feel like we missed out because there were plenty of other animals.  Once the trees bloom it will be even more beautiful just as a nice walk too. You also can rent wagons if you have kids that want to be in and out of the strollers.  Facility was well kept, restrooms and water throughout.  There were a few places to eat, and some small vendors set up throughout.  Fun elephant/water show twice a day.

"The Denver Zoo holds a special place in my heart. When my son was a toddler, I'd take him almost once a week because we loved being here together.

We'd ride the carousel and train. We'd catch the sea lion show. We'd feed nectar to the lorikeets. We'd hunt for the peacocks that wander freely through the zoo. We'd visit Monkey Island,  Elephant Passage, Bear Mountain, and our absolute favorite, Tropical Discovery. It's so beautifully and thoughtfully designed; full of wondrous animals and creatures you'd never imagine getting to encounter at a zoo.

We also love Zoo Lights and Boo at the Zoo. There's not much to dislike about a place that genuinely seems to care for its animals and the guests that visit them. One year Denver Zoo was also awarded the greenest zoo in the country.

"Normally I love the zoo. And I was really looking forward to this visit, since I had not been to the zoo in years. But,  I had many issues with my visit. So I have to give 3 stars instead of 5...#1 I was having mobility issues, there should be a check in line for people with mobility issues. Along those lines there were several exhibits(Rain forest building, Tropical Discovery and at least one other building) that were unavailable to me because of my scooter. I missed out on seeing many unique animals. #2 None of the bathroom entrances were big enough for a wheelchair or scooter to enter. This is not good for people who have trouble walking. And 3# most of the animals I wanted to see, just weren't out. No Bears, no Fennec Foxes, no Pandas (Asian or red), no Rhinos...and no Tigers! I was really looking forward to the tiger exhibit ""The Edge"", we stopped by multiple times, and no tigers. Also, much of the exhibits were under construction. So, a lack of animals to see and a lack of handicapped accessible buildings and bathrooms. Made for an OK visit. The weather was great & the staff was all very friendly and helpful.

A nice collection of animals mainly from Africa and Asia. Their bird collection is extra good. I went early on a Wednesday and it wasn't very crowded until 11 a.m. when it got pretty busy. I didn't have any kids with me and It took me about 3 hours to see everything. You can save $5 by buying your ticket online. For a major metropolitan zoo it is a little old and not as animal-friendly as I would have expected it to be. I think a city as large and diverse is Denver could do a better job with their zoo. However there seems to be a lot of construction going on so maybe that's what they're working on.

It was just an open space where peacocks used to hang out.. Some animals are ""temporarily relocated"" (bears). Highlight of the day was to watch a young hippo playing with ball in the pool. Zoo got crowded fast. Wonder if they have stats on how much attendance grew since 2005. I don't remember seeing such crowds back then. Heard people complaining how long it now takes to stay in line to buy ticket. Couple things the zoo administration should improve: 1) parking situation, 2) train/carousel ticket booth.

"We came from a smaller city and this zoo seemed huge to us. We only got through about one third. The afternoons are so hot and the animals are less active so I'd definitely agree that it's best to get out there as early as possible.

I like that many of the exhibits have an indoor and an outdoor component, so if the animals are inside or sleeping, you can still see them.

I also like reading the back stories of the animals whom many were hurt or rescued from captivity. Otherwise it's a little sad to see large cats or big animals in small enclosures.

I really appreciated also how many zoo staff were around with educational materials and answers to questions. Far more than I've seen at any other zoo.

"The zoo is a fun place to come. It was pretty busy. I'd advise showing up when they open and prepay for tickets online. 1. You avoid the lines and find decent parking.

"Went in January and still saw several animals. I could not find the lions even after asking two workers. They both sent us to the front exhibit which actually rotates between hyenas, wild dogs, and lions and today was hyenas. So I still don't know where the lions were.

I especially enjoyed the giraffe enclosure, the three giraffe who were present couldn't figure out why they couldn't access the part of the enclosure the human - who was there cleaning - was in.  They looked at me and then looked at the human and looked back at me, like I was supposed to do something about it.  I told them they could probably take care of that pesky human who was in the way of a full basket elevated above the floor full of fresh hay, if they really wanted to.  I also tried to reassure them that they probably should just be cool, the human would undoubtedly be giving them food tomorrow, too.

We did the Gambler room. It was an 8/10 for toughness. It was tough. We did not breakout but were minutes away from doing so.
The clues are great! The staff is helpful.
I feel it's hard for everyone to have a chance at solving when there are that many. It kind of ends up being a few solving everything while the rest stand back feeling like they are in the way.

"I went with family - we brought children ages 5, 6, 7 & 10. The kids all enjoyed the experience.

Information: Park in the Crown Plaza and have your parking validated. Plan to spend 1-1.5 hours there. We were there just over an hour and saw everything. We purchased combo Legoland/Sea Life tickets.

Pros: They have a handout for the kids and “punch stations” throughout that encourage kids to read and learn about the animals and exhibits. There is a variety of sea life to look at, some very beautiful exhibits and the information is easy to read and understand - very age appropriate. There is a “touch” station and the kids enjoyed seeing what different creatures felt like.

Cons: I expected to need to spend more time here, it was actually quite small. One of the punch stations for the kids’ activity was out of order. The entire sea turtle display was closed. The final station had iPads available and about 5/15 of the iPads were on and working.

Final Thoughts: This was a neat experience, but once was enough. If you’re looking for an amazing aquarium and zoo experience, consider checking out the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Nebraska.

"This is a rather small aquarium and it's very much set up to not allow guests to easily go back to a previous area. The hallways are very narrow and only allow about two people standing side by side. This creates bottlenecks of people waiting to advance which also prevents going back to a previous exhibit area. I was expecting it to take 2-3 hours to get through depending on stoppage and got through it in under an hour. There are nice little touchscreen information pads near each exhibit but they don't actually have much information. It's limited to showing where the animal is from, the scientific name, endangered status and a one sentence fact. I was stopping to read and learn but there really wasn't much information which is probably by design to push people through quickly.
The big attraction is the weedy sea dragons. They have their own room and a very large tank (I found out it's because of the space they need for their mating dance). A lot of people surprisingly just walked past thinking this was an empty room so maybe the aquarium should do something to better draw people in? While there were two interactive games, there wasn't an information pad like in other areas which was disappointing. There was a chalk wall with information on it. The space was very open and could have benefited from some benches along the walls to sit and enjoy the area. Anyways, I timed my visit for the 3:30 weedy sea dragon talk. I got there early (about 3:10) and caught a keeper feeding them. This was the highlight of my visit. The keeper was very friendly and answered a ton of questions I had like why weedy over leafy sea dragons. I learned a lot about their conservation efforts and the animals. I stuck around until about 3:40 expecting there to be the scheduled talk and no one else showed. That was a bit disappointing because I forgot to ask if there was a way to tell the males from females and the talk was what I was most looking forward to. I'm very glad then I caught the keeper.
Other highlights included the tank with the rays. It had a second story so you could observe them from above which was really cool. Aside from the weedy sea dragons, this is where I spent most of my time. It also was about the only part of the aquarium with benches and it's towards the end of the path.
The gift shop is about as expected. For the aquarium being so proud of the weedy sea dragons, there was zero merch for these guys. Shedd has a small leafy sea dragon exhibit but they have leafy sea dragon merch in the gift shop. So I was disappointed I couldn't buy any weedy sea dragon merch. They did have a variety of stuffed animals including things like rays and starfish. There were plenty of small items like sea turtle magnets for an easy souvenir. Prices seemed pretty reasonable too.
Overall, I think this aquarium is worth a visit if you love aquariums. The price could be a bit lower for what you get but it's not absurd.

"Reason for 4 stars was the price per time spent there. I've been to the Atlanta aquarium and you can spend all day there, wander around as much as you'd like, but this one was like a one way maze and not very big so it only took us an hour to get through which was disappointing and once you get to the end it's an exit to the gift shop. I would've given 3 stars if we paid full price but we had a discount coupon. There was a touch pool where the kids can touch a star fish and the Shark tank was cool but small. If you are trying to decide between here and Legoland I say do Legos, it's a little cheaper and you can spend as much time there as you want (you can at the aquarium too but you have to go back through the maze against the flow of traffic and once you've seen it you've seen it).

It’s a smaller aquarium but it’s very kid friendly AND SPECIAL NEEDS FRIENDLY (so hard to find special needs activities). We only did the aquarium side with included photos upon entry and you can take as many as you want. Definitely recommend if you’re sitting at home bored looking for something to do with the kids.

"After reading the other reviews I almost didn't go, but I'm glad I did! It's not enormous, but I definitely wouldn't call it small. It's in the middle of the country. Why would you expect it to be the size of a coastal aquarium...? I found it to have a lot of interactive exhibits for kids. Only 1 exhibit I saw that you got to touch animals, but... water creatures don't want people touching them, so that seems fine to me. It's located right next to many other family friendly activities, meaning you could probably park and walk to a lot of other things while you were down there.

"I like the idea of being admitted in specific time slots for when you purchase your ticket in theory. However in practice, it's a mess. There are major lines, no one is six feet apart, and it seems like it self defeats the purpose of what safety they are trying to establish in the first place. No clear signage or division of lines for pre-purchased tickets vs day of purchases. And just one cashier trying to handle so many visitors! She did great, just seemed way understaffed for the visitation level.

The aquarium was underwhelming for the cost of entry. They have beautiful tanks and exhibits, but it only takes about 40 minutes to walk through the whole thing. The tunnel is VERY cool. I wanted there to be far more than what I saw. A very small aquarium, definitely targeted towards young families vs. all age friendly.

but fyi, they ask ID for all rated R movies. Which they dont tell you until you have bought the ticket, then they have to refund the money which honestly I didn’t appreciate.

"Came upon this place walking around Coronado Center as I hadn’t been there in a couple of years. What a surprise!

I love arcades, and this one blew my mind. A lot of the games are the Japanese versions which is amazing to find, especially in The Land of Enchantment.

I love claw machines(the more challenging the better), and this place has TONS of them.

I purchased a $40 card and after a few arcade tries I went to try a claw.

After about 10 tries my card ran out of money, and I went to go re-load it. While I was gone, the progress that I had made on the item in the machine was re-set by a worker, which led me to a mini-freakout.

Luckily, he saw me and apologized, opened the machine and placed the item back where it was and let me continue. After about six more tries, I won! The key with the Japanese claw machines is PATIENCE.

I hd a wonderful time at this place, and will definitely be back.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzM011dlp3EAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Round+1/@35.0821683,-106.8165631,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x87220ad20823dbfb:0x44e1e2393471a197!8m2!3d35.1065227!4d-106.5756004!16s%2Fg%2F11gjp333j1?hl=en",ChIJ-9sjCNIKIocRl6FxNDni4UQ,Amusement center,5.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSEhjiLTE2vBHi7MHJn9PhSpITSJri-amg9mSE=w150-h150-k-no-p

"Website was misleading! Drove down just for a family outing, according to the website the unlimited pass was $19.94. I brought 8, and was told this special must be purchased in advance, and used between 5/1 & 6/1/19, no exceptions. The male employee ails started, he'd had a few customers the day before who wanted the discount as well, and he had to figure out how to get to the page that states it's online only! Having a large family, attending these establishments is difficult, not affordable, and discouraging when these discounts are misrepresenting the company without clicking farther into the website. Purchased the packs this time, but will not be doing this again in the future!

"I liked Hinkle because of the Go-Karts and the Lazer Tag. Basically, those are the two main attractions. As for price, it is a bit expensive for the limited variety of stuff to do, and the all day ride pass doesn't include any of the arcade games that make up half of each facility. It really peeves me how much they govern the Go-Karts, they are great and full of potential, but nobody is allowed to use that full potential. The track is more than big enough to allow the riders to go a bit faster, and honestly it is kinda boring unless you are in a grouped up few cars and it is a true race. I think it would be good for business if you guys implimented an 8 car race of ungoverned Karts, only for people over 16 with a valid license, every hour or so. It would also be good to have a more competitive style of Lazer Tag, rather than the typical ""everyone goes to their team, then when it starts we all basically go to each other's base and destroy it and its pretty much whoever kills it the most wins, very sub par.""",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0eE42MWdBRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hinkle+Fun+Center/@35.0821683,-106.8165631,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8718a04616bd7ba3:0x412edc9effd42a9e!8m2!3d35.0955452!4d-106.4982381!16s%2Fg%2F1tyt5tdn?hl=en",ChIJo3u9FkagGIcRnirU_57cLkE,Amusement center,4.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUR2Db56tjzxjJIibT1BMaUC4NiPq7QGHmbjM5=w150-h150-k-no-p

The food was surprisingly good!

"Firstly, they offer a 10% military discount ask for it at the door. It is a digital Meow Wolf style experience with food, bar and live DJ. The space provides an interactive digital entertainment for the whole family, first date, or friends. It can be very fun but I could imagine with a lot of people it could make for a busy experience with lines or frustration attempting to use an exhibit.
Most exhibits are like playing a VR game such as Beat Saber or a VR style Atari Pong while others are interactive or viewable digital art that continuously changes. A very unique experience. I did not try the food or drinks so I cannot speak to their quality or pricing but the main attraction here is the digital environment. Would definitely check out if in the Albuquerque area.

"Quality for the price is. 3/5 star. Recently had the pleasure of visiting the Electric Playhouse for their grand opening and attended the interactive dinner. It was a 5 course, $55 dinner or $75 with wine pairing experience. I got the wine pairing. The main disappointments were (1) the video advertisement for the dinner was much more beautiful than it was in real life. I expected butterflies to be fluttering across the table; at most the animation would vibrate slightly when I held out my hand. (2) The food was inedible, but I may be the only person at the table who thought so as all around me guests WoWed and marveled at their dishes. The first dish was an amuse bouche with salmon and that was a flaky pastry that was at best just okay. The second course was a soggy tamale. However the green-yellow sauce that garnished the dish was delicious. Someone in that kitchen knows how to pair sauces or the tamale was so underwhelming that the sauce stole the show. Next dish was a earthy mushroom and meatballs dish. When they brought it out, it smelled amazing. Like I was in a Siberian forest picking fresh mushrooms. But the meatballs were 2 different types of meat and quite salty. Overall just okay. Then came the steak, I believe, with a biscuit on the side. I could have broken a tooth on that biscuit and the steak had enough sodium content to last me a week. Very salty. Inedible. People next to me, however, raved that it was the best food I ever had! Unbelievable! The desert was fair, it was fruity and light. Thank goodness there was all that wine to drink as I barely touched my $75 dinner. In the future, I would return once the kinks are out, and I'd order the meal vegetarian to get something fresh on my plate.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzdzZ2ZV9nRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Electric+Playhouse/@35.125851,-106.8130894,10z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x87220cc73bd00001:0xc27b576777ca51da!8m2!3d35.1126857!4d-106.6995229!16s%2Fg%2F11f2wmfnvv?hl=en",ChIJAQDQO8cMIocR2lHKd2dXe8I,Amusement center,3.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOx6DhapAAr3KfStSWHi2cu1N0SvJhze5KPbe94=w150-h150-k-no-p

"Great concept... Immersive Dining Experience has a bit to improve upon.  Descriptions of courses and pairings would be a nice touch.

"My work involves a lot of travel and I’ve been fortunate to visit multiple arcades around the world, including Japan. I’d easily rank the four Free Play locations in the DFW metro area collectively as the best arcades I’ve visited in the United States. In fact, I think the fact they routinely acquire new games and swap out machines on the floor gives them an advantage over the few remaining retro Japanese arcades.

In short, THIS is how you do an arcade right. I hate the term “barcade” but I suppose this is one in the sense they have an impressive bar and kitchen on site. That said, unlike almost every other self-styled barcade I’ve visited, the drinks and food complement the games rather than serve as the primary attraction.

What sets Free Play apart is the diversity and rarity of its games. These feature some true gems on original hardware that go well beyond the dime-a-dozen Pac-Man and Centipede cabs found elsewhere. For example, the Richardson location (at the time of this writing) has an ultra-rare Planet Harriers, an Atomiswave running Dolphin Blue, the first Beast Busters, Do Don Pachi, Power Stone 2, and the original Marvel Vs. Capcom…to name just a few. I’m not really into pinball but there are quite a few of those machines on the floor too.

Whether you’re a serious arcade enthusiast or just a casual player who wants an afternoon with your kids, I can’t recommend Free Play enough.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNjg3R0pBEAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Free+Play+Arcade+-+Richardson/@32.4385634,-97.5923751,8z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x864c1e58623fb881:0xc3c49d2468b01a48!8m2!3d32.943805!4d-96.6933059!16s%2Fg%2F11cknw1nz1?hl=en",ChIJgbg_YlgeTIYRSBqwaCSdxMM,Video arcade,5.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQPZQP-zFRfy1PcL0KcmyqaLJe7Z1leS7m_lFN=w150-h150-k-no-p

"The museum had many stages with monitors that show clips of a boat wreck story the museum portrays. The walk is about an hour-and-a-half and the tour is said to be the length of a football field (even though it doesn’t seem like it.) The large water wheel in the entrance is entirely displayed once you go down to the lower level of the museum, which is impressive. The wooden floors will give you the feeling of being inside an old-fashioned steam boat as it creaks and moves in a fragile state. They really did try to make an average boat wreck seem  like the wreck of the century, but I only really just saw average household & local shop items. The engine parts and excavation process was more interesting than the artifacts and that's just my opinion. There are about 2 staff members that are available to answer any questions about the tour and the . It’s not as lively, they can work on being more involved with the visitors.

"So many artifacts from this sunken steamboat! It's a fascinating window into a slice of life in the 1850s. Very cool to see the preservation work continuing. The self-paced tour begins with four stations that each play ~5-minute videos, then there's a longer video in a theater, then free range exploration of the rest of the museum. All of the videos are optional, or you can go back, if you just want to skip ahead to see the exhibits. Our group had some reductant museum-goers, but this offered a little something for everyone in our group: human interest stories, history in context, geology, science and engineering, arts and culture.

The gift shop is the beginning where you can purchase admission and the tour ends there as well. The staff members here were kind and informative.

"Loved the tour! This little museum is worth the visit, for sure. So many fascinating artifacts!

The discovery of the boat is a big part of the story, so it's great to hear from the guys who dug it up. I think the video could be updated (cheesy reenactments were distracting)

An exhibit I enjoyed was a detail of one particular passenger, with his pants and personal items telling a story about who he was. I think it would be great to see more of that.

I was excited to see the area where they preserve and analyze the artifacts, but it's a small space, and no one was there to demonstrate. That could be further developed into quite a unique experience - I can't think of one museum that lets you see the process first hand.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRbmNHMW5RRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Arabia+Steamboat+Museum/@39.1146126,-94.6558727,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x87c0f08b1db80791:0xa0f9ff1469a91714!8m2!3d39.1094732!4d-94.5813811!16s%2Fg%2F11bbs_5qvb?hl=en",ChIJkQe4HYvwwIcRFBepaRT_-aA,Museum,4.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPL4fN7dmidN6j8bQLphpD6B9LPD65_iGGvKOlB=w150-h150-k-no-p

"A pre-Civil War time capsule and a successful treasure hunt exposed to the public. My trip was the second time I had visited the museum but with the first being a rushed field trip it felt like it was my first visit.

The museum provides only tours but once you get the introductory speech while being able to  see a section of the stern and a movie about the discovery of the steamboat than you are given a chance to explore the rest of the displays at your own leisure.

The displays are separated mostlg into large rooms in which similar items are displayed such as dishes, hardware, clothing, etc. As a result just the amount of items found, cleaned and given preservative measures is astounding. After leaving this section there is a room that allows you to learn more about life during the time, more exploration about steamboat travel, seeing more parts of the Arabia and getting more details on the recovery of the boat.

The visitor also gets a chance to talk with laboratory techs to discuss the process of cleaning and preserving artifacts as there is still another 1/3 to go.

"Probably more of an attraction than a museum, this place houses remarkable remains from the steamship Arabia, which sank in the Mississippi River in 1856. Preserved for 130ish years in mud, before being dug up in the 1980s', the ship's cargo of pre-Civil War goods is in pristine condition. Even the behemoth metal boilers that powered the steamer’s paddle wheels are perfectly intact.

The museum is dedicated to the Steamboat Arabia that sunk in the Missouri River during the 1850's.

After the ship sank, it was lost for more than a hundred years until found by a group of family members and their friends who now run the museum. Today, you can view all unblemished materials of the ship ranging from boots, hats and farm tools to European Jewlry, Perfumes and bottles of whisky that are still drinkable.

I will say that the drinks are a little pricey. For example, I ordered the ""Marathon"" which is the drink named after Nipsey Hustle, which was $15.

"We made a visit to the Trap Museum during a very busy holiday weekend. Juneteenth. The line was wrapped around the building and up through the parking lot. New paragraph. You're going to need to pay to park unless you are going to risk it and park on the street. Parking is about $10.

Once you get in line no one let you know that you can pay for a VIP pass and skip the line for $20. Unless you asked about it you want no. We heard another lady asked about it and she was told that she could go to the front of the line for an additional $20 on top of the $20 he already paid.

It was so hot outside we paid the money. It is rather small, which definitely resemble the trap house, but it has great content and material inside. I thoroughly enjoyed our experience there. Lots of information and good artwork. I was just really love how they pay homage to so many different rapper and artist.

"Awesome experience! I did the trap museum and the escape room and it was worth the $45. The escape room is highly entertaining. The trap room is informative, you'll learn much about the King and other southern artist. My group spent about 2 hours in the escape room and trap museum. It's not very big but great to take pictures, it's s chill environment.

"I have been a residence of GA  for 4 years (grew up in the south).  Had friends come into town and it was my first time going.
My honest opinion: I have an appreciation for all music. Crunk/trap is definitely one that has created the current culture of Atlanta. I also appreciate people who come from these communities have some level of representation. The reasons why I give this a 3 stars is because of the lack of education the museum provided and the overhype. If they provided visitors (who haven’t experienced this lifestyle) insight/depth knowledge it would have been a much better experience. DEFINITELY NOT KID FRIENDLY! I was surprised at people bringing their young children to this 🙄. Should be an age limit.
To me, it was just a display of a “trap house” that you can see for free in these same communities lol.
I definitely enjoyed seeing the montage of the different rap eras (80s-current), the studio, and recording booths, artworks, bar, and the staff were friendly.

"I battled between 3 and 4 stars but I think my love for T.I. I gave it 4. With that being said, I love the concept…growing up in this environment, this place definitely brought back some memories. A life I’m glad was in the past. It still seems to be a big crowd which is amazing since they’ve been open a while. You will have to pay for parking which there are two different lots. It’s like going to club back in the day you have the general admission line and then the cut line where you can pay a little extra. I chose the general line because I don’t know what I’m getting into to pay extra. Those cut lines are reasons I don’t go out anymore. In line, I like the energy of Trina outside, she let you know hey, you pay a little extra and get in. There was a younger guy who came out bashing the people who decided to stay in the general line..in actuality if we all went over there then the line would be the same anyway. So to be ridiculed and called broke and we need to apply for a PPP loan is pretty tasteless. Yes, I get it, this is kind of a hood like establishment. But don’t be disrespectful. It went on for sometime and I was really tempted to just leave but I was already in line some time. After getting in the check in ladies were a breath of fresh air (they were nice)and the granny was funny. I would love to go on a not so crowded day and really look around. With the crowd it’s not that normal museum feel it’s more of a crowded small club feel and you can’t really see the exhibits. They have a bar area but it was way too many people to even attempt to get a drink. I may come back for the museum but I do want to try the escape room to see their take on that.

My son wanted to come to the Trap House Museum for his 21st birthday. This place is overrated and is a rip off. I wasn’t impressed with it. It was like a haunted house where it takes you like 10 minutes to completely look around and then you’re done. Parking was close to nonexistent. People here will do about anything to make that quick buck. It was about $20 to get in and it wasn’t worth the money paid for. I guess it’s popular because of T.I. I am glad I went so that the hype of going there is something I can tell others about. It was interesting to experience as after you went around there was like an area you can hang out and order drinks. I am in my 40s so maybe it’s just not my cup of tea. My son took pictures and he said it wasn’t what he expected it to be like so it might not be an age thing. It was also raining the day we went and the line was super duper long and wasn’t moving. We waited in line for about 10-15 minutes until we saw a little glimpse of hope to seeing the line move. My bf talked to one of the guys up front and we were able to cut the line. It was worth whatever my bf said as I would’ve been super soaked by the time we got inside. There was also construction around the area when we went so it was muddy and wet.

"The “museum” is just ok. Music is fire…lol. Small on the inside (can walk through and see everything in 15-20 minutes if that) but probably still worth paying $20 to skip the line that is around the corner everyday it is open.

"I came here in June of 2021 and it was a great experience. I would go back. If you're going to go, go early, either way there will be a line, but the earlier the better. I went on a Saturday and the line wasn't too bad. I got there before they opened. They opened right at 12:00 pm and it took about 30 minutes to get inside. People who paid to skip the line, will be getting in before you. It's $20 to get in, and it was $10 to park. You can pay an extra $20 to skip the line. There was a parking lot right next to the museum, it was very convenient. I believe  there was another parking lot down the street. They have signs out letting you know where to park, which is super convenient. The area where you will be eating in line is not covered, so if it's raining, hot, or cold, you will be in the elements.

You will not be able to bring food or drinks in, and you will be patted at the door if you're a man, and women will have their bags checked.

When you get in, it's small, but there is so much to see and take in. Tons of pictures, displays, album covers, and facts about our favorite trap rappers. They also have a bar. I didn't try the drinks, so I can't speak on how they are. There are plenty of photo opps, so have your phone charged and ready. I was in there for about 40 minutes, maybe an hour. Like I said, so much to see.

The atmosphere is cool. They have music playing, it's a good vibe.

When you leave out, they have a little area for food, and also merch, and also a smokehouse. I bought some merch, it was a bit pricey, but to me it's worth it.

All in all I would say you should definitely visit if you like trap music and you're in the Atlanta area. It's a cool experience. You can check out my video review on my youtube channel.

"We waited in line on a Saturday afternoon for about 25-30 minutes, this museum seems to attract a lot of out of town traffic. There were vehicles from all over the South and beyond. Admission is $10 but you can pay $20 and skip the line. Make sure you potty beforehand, a guest from our party was told they would have to pay to enter just to use the restroom so she had to hold it until we made it through the line. When we made it in we paid and we were on our way. I’m not sure if guided tours are offered but it was congested as we walked  throughout. The exhibits are very exposed and as much as the signs say don’t touch or move...people were touching and moving. I imagine things are damaged regularly. The PART that I found most interesting was the journey, TRAP can be very negative (the lifestyle, crime, drugs, and devastation to the black community) but it also shows how opportunities lead to the success of many artists which created new platforms to make positive changes.

"Go on a weekday when its less expensive, less crowded, & you get more time to solve the Escape Room (which also means you get a private tour if the Museum). Starting with the Escape Room, its nearly impossible to solve in the 30 minutes of allotted time given on the weekends without the Escape Room rep (who literally sits in the room with you) barking out all the clues that are pretty much dead giveaways. Its annoying & negates the “escape” part of the experience. If it were not for the fact that booking the Escape Room prevents you from standing in the line that quickly wraps around the building, I would probably skip it all together. As for the actual “museum”, its not really. What you’ll find are scenes that play to familiarities of the “trap” world plus a lot of mediocre art of trap artists. What this really is is a chance to post for the Gram & have a couple of good laughs. There is no deep dive into the trap culture or the music that was born from it.

I purchased my tickets in advance which was a good thing. The line for the museum was super long.

"The museum itself is pretty awesome with historic paraphernalia, old school CDs and mixtapes, clothes, and artwork that has captured nearly everyone who has had a contribution to trap music or music in the south. However, the museum is quite small and for people to have to wait outside in a line is honestly a little ridiculous for this compact museum. Escape the Trap was quite an experience. Our group really enjoyed that portion of the experience. There is also tons of backdrops for pictures.  There's also a bar to order adult beverages. And I actually thought that that was catering to the audience that might patronize this type of museum. It is quite unique and still worth the trip to visit the museum. There are even two small rooms where you can make trap beats and your own song where you can sing or rap over a track.  I love the concept of the museum and the ode to rap music, hip-hop music, trap music, and all southern rap artist alike!  Executed well for the culture.

"I gave 4 Stars because 3.5 wasn't an option. While I understand the concept behind the museum,  it is truly a Trap for your money but this visit was on behalf of my teen.
Parking:
There's 2 sets of parking. One behind the gate for $20 and the other in an opened lot for $10.
The Wait:
The hype is definitely behind how many people are standing in line. We visted on a Saturday and waited in line about 45 minutes before the museum opened at 12pm. It was HOT and a cold bottle of water could have been included with entry. If not, someone should have been present before doors opened to sell water to guests. Thankfully we were in line with an entertaining crew to help pass time.
Entry:
I didn't quite get the purpose of purchasing tickets online AND signing a waiver when you could have just walked in/up paid cash or paid with a credit card. COVID Protocols DID NOT EXIST! The young lady handling the foyer area and money crowded everyone into such a small space. There was no organization when it came to ticket holders vs cash payment vs credit card payments.
Inside:
The inside was ok. The only thing missing was the trace of a body on the floor. If you are from the hood and have been exposed to the life some of the exhibits are very familiar. We hung out there for about 30-45 minutes because I purchased one of THE BEST mixed drinks.

Of course, Rick Ross , future, Migos and more they even had selfie frames for ppl to take pics with and many photo opportunities with the different displays! overall it was a cool experience !

"As a native Atlantan, I am torn about this place. It is certainly our history, especially for those of us who came of age in the late 80s and 90s. I loved seeing the old photographs of a city that I love, one that has changed so much. I also respect some of the signage that educates visitors about the prison pipeline for black boys and men as well as the story behind trap music. But the multiple walls of guns and another wall made of bricks of cocaine was just jarring. Real, I am sure, but also overkill, in my opinion.

A very unique experience and a spot that should be on your list of places to try if you are visiting Atlanta. The art posted was interesting and I actually learned a few things. The bar at the end of the museum kind of threw me off a bit - I guess I wasn't expecting to see a bar in a museum.  There were individuals in there in the evening that were under 18 years of age and around the drinking adults so that was awkward. I personally would not bring my child.

"I took my teenage son here on a Saturday evening. I was able to purchase our tickets online before our visit and I appreciated that there was no expiration on the tickets and I could use them on any Friday, Saturday or Sunday that we chose. We really liked the displays and how real they felt.  For those who would like a beverage there is a bar inside and a DJ. There’s also a food truck located right outside the exit. There were a few things that I had issues with:
1. This place is operated like a night club. There’s one long line for general admission, but you can pay an extra $20 per ticket to jump the line ($40/person). So while we stood in line for over an hour people were arriving and walking to the front of the line. The line jumpers get priority so the line moves very slowly. The website doesn’t mention a “jump the line” fee, and there’s no separate line for those who purchased tickets online. So we waited in the long line with everyone purchasing general admission tickets.
2. The museum is really small inside with limited space but there was no control of the amount of people allowed inside at one time - like a night club. Also, the website says masks are required upon entering, but this was not enforced so maybe 5 of 100 people had on masks.
3. Parking is limited and you have to pay. And depending on what person is controlling the lot the price to park will vary. I was not aware of the parking before arriving and I didn’t see parking mentioned on the website. When We first arrived there was a man controlling the lot and he said the price was $20, cash only. I did not have cash so I set out to find a nearby lot for free. I was unsuccessful so I found an ATM, withdrew cash and returned an hour later. When we returned there was now a woman controlling the lot and her price was $15. And it only took 20 minutes max to go through the entire museum.
3. T.I.’s son King was there, and while we stood in line he came out of the museum at least twice to pick young ladies from the line that appeared to fans of his and escorted them inside for free - like a night club.
4. There is smoking allowed on the premises. We we literally standing in line behind a couple and the man was smoking weed, and being encouraged by a couple of the employees.
My teenage son enjoyed the visit but for me it felt like a nightclub disguised as a museum. I would not recommend bringing children under 17.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeU0yb25RRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Trap+Music+Museum/@33.8128975,-84.482632,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x88f5055d2c4f0669:0xd13f474b3bc58d9c!8m2!3d33.7717788!4d-84.4085049!16s%2Fg%2F11gv169_hd?hl=en",ChIJaQZPLF0F9YgRnI3FO0tHP9E,Museum,2.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMliB8CLWV7SVvkfjKvr_ScQO0Nnh8X9rSGzbiH=w150-h150-k-no-p

"So I went yesterday with my sister and my cousin for her birthday. This was everyone’s first time going. We had paid for the “escape the trap” escape room. It was my first time doing an escape room. The 3 men that worked in that exhibit were AMAZINGGGGG. They made the whole experience great. Let’s talk about the bartender Nubia. We absolutely LOVE her. So friendly and kind and the girl knows how to make a drink. The only downsides to this experience is one of the workers had a nasty attitude with me, but I’m not going to put her out. I was looking forward to seeing what art I could purchase, but she killed allat. The second downside is I think this could be so much bigger. If we wouldn’t have had the escape the trap experience we would have been in and out in 10 minutes. Overall, get you a drink, do the trap tour, and make friends with the staff.
The staff really make this place what it is. 🧡-mamacitaaa",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxZ3VydXZBRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Trap+Music+Museum/@33.8128975,-84.482632,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x88f5055d2c4f0669:0xd13f474b3bc58d9c!8m2!3d33.7717788!4d-84.4085049!16s%2Fg%2F11gv169_hd?hl=en",ChIJaQZPLF0F9YgRnI3FO0tHP9E,Museum,4.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZAR0INZOniwB2VoIE81PQ6C2d7gjmdsePqBVv=w150-h150-k-no-p

"Millenial hip hop fans will see this as an awesome experience for the culture. There's lots of great exhibits dedicated to trap life for you to pose with and nice portraits of hip hop music's most prolific artists. My fav was the illuminescent Yo Gotti painting. I must say however, I was sad to see they took Kodak out though only because I'm from FL. I did the escape room too and I think the clues were a little difficult to decipher (especially that last one involving the cards). Our Games Master (host) was really funny and dropped just enough hints here and there to help my group proceed. If it's your first time it's worth the extra $10 for the Escape Room because you can skip the line to the museum. Good job Tip Harris! Definately a bucket list addition to every hip hop fan who's in ATL.

"Very very rude staff from the manager to the floor staff. They stopped our bowling lanes for a long time without our notice and started repairs on them. Someone from management should have informed us about the repair and let us know once done. No communication at all. They didn't extend the time which they took for their repair instead blaming us. When complained to the manager he has no regret and he don't feel apologetic. After spending hundreds of dollars, we just got disappointment. It is a matter of principles, where they can apologize and return the time they used for maintenance. Even though they have everything in their hand, still don't want to make things normal. Managers and staff of this behavior spoil the name of the business. I will never go or recommend anyone to go there and spoil your time while dealing with this staff.

The general smell of the hotel was clean and pleasant when you walked in, what a nice surprise! There is a decent FREE breakfast bar in the morning but come early to avoid the herds.
Check in was done professionally if not overly friendly. The hotel is located on a dead end but strangely, it's a very peaceful and quiet place. 4 ☆☆☆☆ We will def come back to stay when we're in KC.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRNElXRHVnRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Quality+Inn+%26+Suites/@39.1749414,-94.597929,12z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x87c0fb95b885585d:0xd83c5bc38421066f?hl=en",ChIJXViFuJX7wIcRbwYhhMNbPNg,Hotel,4.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNx4O66zWjsT704qHWWNtwvWFec8u3J4sPwl5jT=w150-h150-k-no-p

"This hotel is all hype and no substance. If you like ridiculously tiny overpriced rooms with concrete walls then this place is for you. We walked into an 80 degree room because their AC was on the fritz. Didn’t cool down till late at night. One entire wall is a floor to ceiling window so by noon you have to use the blackout shade to keep the room cool. So then it feels like you’re in a prison cell.
Location is great but otherwise too many cons:
- mandatory valet parking at $46/night.
- weak AC and water pressure
- room is so tiny with barely a closet and no dressers so you have no place to put your things. Barely have a place to walk.
- the blackout curtains don’t work properly and suddenly go up and down on their own.
- hotel is on Wilshire so tons of street noise (windows are not sound proofed)
- construction going on next door
- plumbing is terrible
- gym is tiny in relation to the size of this hotel (as well as their pool).

It’s just not worth it for what they charge. Definitely not a place you want to stay at for more than a night or two. The tv is so high and can’t be adjusted to tilt down.

"I stayed one night at The LINE Hotel on Wilshire to attend the Blackpink concert at Banc of California stadium on Nov. 20. It was a short visit as I flew in from Honolulu on the 20th and arrived at the hotel around 4:30pm. Whoa, a pretty eclectic place ... very industrial, loft-ish style with bare concrete walls and austere furnishings. My room was on the smallish size with a small, but perfectly adequate bathroom, a very small closet and just enough seating for two. The bed faced the floor-to-ceiling wall of glass overlooking Wilshire Boulevard. There is a wall-mounted TV and power shades for privacy.

The concert was at 8pm and I arranged a ride at 5:30pm so I went to the bar for a drink. It's a nice space but there was a limited selection of gins so I ordered a Hendricks gin and tonic. A perfectly fine drink, albeit at a price. As this is a review of the hotel, I'll omit anything related to the concert.

I returned at midnight and wanted to find a place to have some drinks and dinner but it was too late. So, I had to make do with whatever I had in my duffle bag (cookies) and retired for the night. The bed is comfortable though the noise from the street was somewhat intrusive.

The next morning I went down to the 2nd floor where the Openaire Restaurant is located. It's a bright, airy space with a large bar on one side. I had the LINE breakfast: two eggs, pancakes, chicken sausage and cottage potatoes. The eggs were somewhat underdone but the breakfast was fine; at least for an hour. I spent the remainder of my stay in the bathroom in my room ... something in the breakfast didn't agree with me. I do have a sensitive stomach but the only thing I could think of were the undercooked eggs. Oh well, 2 hours later I felt better and checked out to return to LAX and flew back to Honolulu.

Final thoughts ... I like the hotel and its location but I think at least one of the bars should stay open past 10pm. This is LA, not Honolulu. Would I return? Yes, I would, in spite of my issues with my breakfast.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCd0xxMjJ3RRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+LINE+LA/@34.0838366,-118.7512207,10z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x80c2b882f3483d13:0x976facce17b023cd!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d34.0621465!4d-118.3010175!16s%2Fg%2F1tfzxrm_?hl=en",ChIJEz1I84K4woARzSOwF86sb5c,Hotel,4.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkefT_ySQ0jhacmfUlo46vRwmec-p0KzKtKeZK=w150-h150-k-no-p

"The interior design is really nice, and the big window makes the room to feel more spacious (or the room is actually quite small for the price).

Slippers are provided in the room, and there are many plugs the room for you to charge whatever devices you have.

Nevertheless, the air conditioner is constantly going on and off; it is not only noisy, but it also keeps changing the room temperature from too hot to too cold.

Sound proof is not great - you can hear a lot of noises from the streets at night.

"I would give negative stars if something of that sort was there. I would like to show some  pictures before really describing about the service because this is what a “4-star” hotel in  Los Angeles ,USA  can offer.
Are they mocking on themselves or us?
Because I haven’t  had such a terrible service in my lifetime !!!!!
1)We find this 4-star hotel and see that we need to pay for parking when their website actually shows free parking under amenities.
2)We had a long 9hrs journey and we were relocating so we had lot of stuff as luggage and happen to check in by 10.30pm.We told the front desk that we are really tired and what they offered was a trolley and we had to carry entire luggage ourselves, explanation was “we don’t have anybody” when they are supposed to have somebody for customers “all the time”.RIDICULOUS!!!!Clearly shows LACK OF EMPATHY.
Well we carried our own luggage since we were super tired to find another hotel.
3)We got into room and we see our bath shower is worn off and broken.
4)No kettle which is like a very basic thing to make coffee in morning, we asked and receptionist could tell us there is a cafe which will be opened by 6.30am.Clearly shows RUNNING FROM RESPONSIBILITY
5)Now I didn’t know 4 star hotels started keeping open plastic bucket as waste bins in bathrooms.SERIOUSLY!!!!!
6)And the funniest out of all is they have kept a big basket with snacks chocolates, nuts, water and I was skeptical about it and I just called up to know if they come as complementary. Well it seems it is kept to tempt the people to use it and they will charge for every single thing during checkout .
7)Even 2-star hotels actually have hair dryers, kettle and covered waste bins in bathroom.

I don’t even know what to say .Can’t believe I’m given such a terrible service in a developed country like USA.

"The worst hotel ever. I would rather stay in a best westin that has proper close and double glazed windows than in a hotel room that had zero insulation which made me felt like I was experiencing the LA desert weather as a homeless.
Since the windows don’t even close properly, you can hear everything on the streets at all time. I could not fall asleep at ease and was shivering every night while I was there.
The hotel is also not hygienic as a self-proclaimed 4-star hotel.
It also charges resort fees. Was there a beach with towel service I missed?

The manager ghosted me after me emailing him about how cold I was overnight and could not sleep. The front staff did the best they could by switching me to another room that also had a broken windows. At that point, I was too exhausted.

"Very hipster/modern vibe to the entire hotel including the common and private areas. The rooms have concrete walls and automatic open/close blackout and sheer Roman blinds to manage the light from the massive full wall window which is essential if u have a view of the Hollywood sign which I did in my King room.

The room was also fit for tech and the inputs for the tv were located in a panel on the top of the desk. I was able to connect my PlayStation 5 and my laptop easily to display on the TV.

The staff was helpful and helped me thru getting my business trip authorization forms to properly charge my business card and holding my bags for me until checkin as the room took a while to be ready for checkin.

Lots of interesting things to do daily from the happy hours at the hotel bar to an array of bars nearby that cater to hotel guests including a speakeasy(if ur adventurous enuf to find it)

There is a rooftop restaurant that is in a greenhouse near the pool. The food is on par price wise with hotel restaurants. This was scenic during sunrises.

There are a couple of art installations including murals and 3-D art inside and out. Artsy and explorers will want to have a bit of free time to roam around and take pictures.

Not much parking the valet stand is quite monopolizing of most of what should be parking but this is to be expected in this part of the city, koreatown.

1. the latest style of watching TV. No on demand or netflix etc. The connections to attach you device didn't work and didn't have the ability to connect latest Android devices.
2. Noise insulation from outside and noise between rooms. We were women in the middle of the night by noisy neighbours 2 nights. And the Windows are really thin and let on noise and drafts.

The service is really kind, everyone is willing to help and everyone seemed so genuine. It was quite refreshing.

"I booked this hotel with high hopes as it looked superbly awesome from the photos, and we are very grateful that they upgraded us to a Hollywood view because it's our honeymoon.

The decor in the room is fantastic, great tables and chairs with little interesting items here and there. However there's not much space for us to open our luggage though.

The reason why i consider this a casual and perhaps 3.5* hotel only is because of the way the hardware is maintained.

The light in the main room couldn't really detect the switch so it took us awhile to switch anything on/off.

Toilet on our second day decided to clog itself up and we had to call the maintenance guy but it was solved in a jiffy.

Front desk folks are very nice, always happy to answer your queries.

Beware not to book this room on weekends if you are looking for a good night's sleep, as there's the city's most popular bar below and the music can be heard up to level 9 where we stayed.

"I don’t recommend The LINE LA for events. The hotel suffered in 2 main areas:

(1) They didn’t “think through” the event for the amount of people we had (170+). They got the initial execution, but didn't think about what happens next. Ex: Yes, they had the food stations put up, but didn’t think about where people will eat. Where will they put their dirty plates? Etc.
(2) Their general answer to everything was “no, sorry.” Not super helpful.

Below is a very high level insight into our issues of different portions of the event.

COCKTAIL PARTY
We had a 3-day event with a cocktail party the first night. The food came out halfway through the event (everyone was starving). The layout of the food stations (empty most of the event) cut the room in half, which made everything very cramped. They had 4 tiny 2-top tables so when everyone got food, no one knew what to do because one hand had a drink, the other had their food. There were no high tops or areas to rest their drink/plate/etc. Let alone areas to put dirty plates. There were more issues, but I'll move on to the conference.

BREAKFAST
Had to eat in the conference room. Okay- forgiven - perhaps space is limited. But for a conference with networking, having meals at a table where they can talk and not stare at the stage is important. You won't get that here. Also, they bring out one coffee dispenser at a time. For 170+ people, they should bring out a few at least for breakfast. We were out of coffee the first 15 mins and had to find someone each time to refill it. Also, there was no place to put dirty plates. You had to find someone.

CONFERENCE
A good chunk or our tablecloths were stained. Some very stained. Some had smaller stains. And some clean. They didn't have any to spare, so couldn't remove the very stained ones. (They should really throw them out). They also had to resort to food station tablecloths (without leg area open for sitting). So about 1/3 of our guests couldn't tuck their chairs in. In addition, the ""WIFI"" was a mess. We had gotten a sponsored WIFI for our event and were supposed to have 4 logins for admins. Well, the sponsored WIFI didn't work (so the posters with WIFI PW were pointless). The hotel WIFI was spotty the 1st day and 2nd morning. Thankfully they got their hotel WIFI back up right before our panels began and we had to use instead. (It was being streamed virtually, so WIFI was crucial).

LUNCH
Our lunch was in a separate hall (separate building with tables to sit and eat). Yay! However, the lunch station ran out of food - so many people didn't get tortillas for their tacos, or any of the tamales, etc. The line to get food was slow - they should’ve set up 2 areas, but that was the least of the issues.

HOTEL STAFF
We kept getting told they were understaffed. They knew of our event months in advance, so not sure why they hadn’t planned better. Too few cleaning crew (so wouldn't extend check out 1 hour). Too few bell hops (had to be my own bellman & took conference gear to the front with their luggage cart). The overall answer was ""no"" to our requests. ""No"" they can't cover the exit sign of a blocked door behind our stage. No. No. No. The front desk girl could care less about helping, as well. Mind you, some were incredible to work with… as long as you didn’t ask for something. I think the issue is the hotel doesn't empower their employees to help and find solutions. Just to say ""no, sorry."" Insincere, but the sorry is thrown in there.

ROOM
I think overall the room was okay. It's a tight room, but that wasn't the issue. The room set up was just awkward. Some items mentioned by colleagues: closet was too small to hang all their work clothes, no luggage holder, no easy access to items (like the clock with usb plugs is on the side of the bed with no access to it). No switch for main lights (turned on manually at the lamp). Etc.

Want a room - it'll be fine. Want to host an event. I don’t recommend them. Again, there were more issues, but these were some of the bigger annoyances.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXX2I3Zmd3RRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+LINE+LA/@34.0838366,-118.7512207,10z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x80c2b882f3483d13:0x976facce17b023cd!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d34.0621465!4d-118.3010175!16s%2Fg%2F1tfzxrm_?hl=en",ChIJEz1I84K4woARzSOwF86sb5c,Hotel,1.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-7sznqSOYvQHDP6OhCUPnAYeoYdiZAwVzFJTJ=w150-h150-k-no-p
"I really enjoyed this hotel and glad I selected it for my first trip to LA. It's directly across the street from the train station and surrounded by several bus lines. There's also a really nice church next to it that's worth checking out. I believe it's the Oasis church. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly. The rooms were clean, quiet and the beds comfortable. My first time seeing the Hollywood sign was from my room! Exciting! Commissary, the hotel restaurant was pretty decent. It's aesthetically pleasing giving it an overall good vibe. I even received cilantro seeds in a package along with my bill which was a nice touch. One issue was the kitchen eating area setup. Because the kitchen is in the hotel and the eating area is separated, the staff had to walk outside with my food resulting in pieces from trees on my plate. Also, while there, a pool party was given. During this time I attempted to get a non-alcoholic drink and was told to go outside with the party goers to order a drink or go to another restaurant downstairs in the hotel lobby. I was aware of the pool party in advance and planned to relax by the poolside once it was over. I was unable to do this since the party ended later than the time announced.

"Awesome hotel in the heart of Koreatown.

We stayed here a few nights before a wedding to explore LA. Centrally located in town so you can get around to everything. There is a great coffee shop downstairs called Alfred's 😁. The rooms have a really cool look, and you can see the Hollywood sign depending on which side you're on.

The last night we were there we found the Korean themed karaoke speakeasy in the back of the hotel 🤯. The morning after, we had a delicious brunch at the open air restaurant.

"Formerly known as the Wilshire Hyatt and more recently the Wilshire Radisson, it seems that neither of the major renovations tackled the obvious but expensive task of replacing 1960s single glazed windows.

"So room, service and location was very good however there are some things that I think a potential guest should be aware of. This is a party hotel geared towards a younger crowd. I was here from a Wednesday to Wednesday and there is a DJ blasting music every night especially on the weekends. This is not necessarily a bad thing however the hotel is not sound proof. I stayed on the 11th floor and could hear cars drive by all night as well as the partying from the pool area. The pool area is ALWAYS crowded so there is no time to take an actual swim or just chill before starting or ending your day. The front desk and valet are great. There is no parking so you must valet but they are very quick. The rooms are very cute however one quick note, the beds are super soft. If you need a former mattress, this may be an issue for you. The hotel has a decent gym with state of the art equipment as well as yoga and running events for guest. The rooms also have a great mini bar with drinks, snacks, and even condoms.

"Aesthetics and vibe of this hotel aside (you may love it or hate it; personally, I kind of liked it), the Line is a really poorly designed, built, and maintained hotel. Functionally, this is one of the most poorly designed hotels I've ever stayed in. From the signs in the elevator that show the lower floors at the top, to the metal bird hangings that jab you in back of the head if you lean too far back on the backless desk chairs, to the low bare-cornered beds that find your shins in the dark as you try to find the bathroom, to the nearly complete lack of hooks in the bathroom, this hotel screams of design that tries to be ultra-hip with a glaring disregard for utility. Maintenance is also a massive problem at the Line. We visited the pool deck on Friday afternoon to find it littered with trash and used towels. The middle elevator was out of service for the entire weekend, leaving only 2 over-used elevators (which are frequently used by non-hotel guests to go between floors 1 and 2 for the Openaire restaurant). At one point, it took us ~15 minutes to get from floor 12 down to the lobby. But, the biggest problem with this hotel, and the reason that I will likely never stay there again is the windows. We had a room south-facing room on the highest floor (12) overlooking Wilshire Blvd. Despite the high floor, this was one of the noisiest hotel rooms I’ve ever slept in. All night long, you hear sirens and cars revving their engines as they race down Wilshire. There is absolutely no sound isolation from the windows. To make things worse, there is no air isolation either. The air quality in downtown LA was really bad while we were staying there. I’m not sure if this was standard LA air quality or perhaps it was fueled by the nearby wildfires. But, at night I could smell the pollution in our room and feel it in my throat. Inspection of the windows shows that there are actually gaps in each window frame that cannot be closed. From a sound and air isolation perspective, you might as well be camping out on Wilshire Blvd. It’s really bad, and I’d encourage you to really look elsewhere to stay until the hotel does a renovation of all their windows.

All of that being said, there are some good things: cool shop (Poketo) in the lobby, great having an Alfred coffee right there as well, location in Koreatown is great if that’s your scene, and the views are pretty great.

No. Stay somewhere else until Line gets their act together.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwbnMySWZBEAE,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+LINE+LA/@34.0838366,-118.7512207,10z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x80c2b882f3483d13:0x976facce17b023cd!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d34.0621465!4d-118.3010175!16s%2Fg%2F1tfzxrm_?hl=en",ChIJEz1I84K4woARzSOwF86sb5c,Hotel,2.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTbO6OCtAvukMGWxh_52kQP-b0Ia_IOzzp0Dra=w150-h150-k-no-p

"This was the weirdest hotel I have ever stayed in with the worst customer service I have ever experienced. After I booked the hotel, I never received a confirmation email. I called them, they diconnected me, I called them again, they said they'd send me an email, it never came. When I got there and checked in, it was $150 more than what I was quoted because there was a charge that was not listed anywhere on their website and had never been mentioned anywhere. This was just the beginning of the awfulness- the room was so small that there was nowhere to even put our suitcases, just trying to walk to the bed I smacked my head on the television. Everything in the room was for sale, including a regular rock for $20 which was just really tacky looking. Speaking of tacky, the ""art"" in the lobby, literally looked like garbage.

I chose Marriott West for our staycation because of the outdoor & indoor pool. This hotel did not disappoint. We celebrated my son's birthday poolside and had the best weekend! Room was adequate. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful especially with Covid concerns. Grab and go breakfast was a nice treat. We do staycations often and this is definitely our new go-to local hotel!

"Better then some hotels but could be better overall.
Checked in easily. But the key card stopped working when we left the room the first time and had to come back twice to get a replacement.
We weren't told to keep our phones away from the card until the third replacement.
We left for 3 hours and turned the AC down while gone.  Came back and the room was so hot we almost threw up packing up our stuff.
They then gave us a different room after we had to carry everything which took us 2 trips the first time down to the lobby back to the 5th floor. They did give us free breakfast for the inconvenience but would of been nice if they could of met us on the floor instead of 2 trips down to get the room and 1 trip with the luggage cart up.
Breakfast was so so half of the buffet was kinda cold. Wouldn't pay for it so for a free breakfast it's decent.
They also didn't explain any charges so I had a mini panic attacks that they charged me an extra 100 for my room only to go down and have the free explained

"It was my first time staying at a hostel and I'm glad it was at this location, close to the lake in a nice area. Compared to many a 1-star motel or hotel, it's bare bones in room amenities, but the sense of community and the savings are good reasons to consider staying in one. What comes to mind is a boarding house, which I suppose hostels are akin to, but the staff at this place are helpful and responsive to guest needs and concerns. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and the nice patio area. Our fellow guests were from various places and the ones we met were friendly.

Nearby are many nice restaurants, cafes, businesses, conveniences, and bars. To the east is the North Pond, and further the lake shore. You can walk, run, or bike to your heart's content (convenient for pet owners too as it's very pet friendly in the area). It's less than 15 minutes away from the conservatory and the zoo (both free). There are are wonderful museums both in the area and a little further away (but in stone's throw).

Tips: 1) bring your own food to store in the plentiful refrigerated cases (they provide bins and labels) to save on dining expenses or if you have specific dietary requirements. 2) Their parking spaces are limited so arrive within 5 minutes of check-in. It's $28 a night to park there. 3) Alternatively, use an app like SpotHero to book affordable longer term spaces in the area (12 hours to a several days). 4) the kitchen is huge and well maintained, but do your part to help keep it that way (same goes for the bathrooms). 5) if you're looking for fun things to do, check out the activities chalkboard in the lobby. 6) Be respectful, kind, and friendly to everyone there. You will get out of the experience what you put into it.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxemRMMUlREAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Chicago+Getaway+Hostel/@41.9268713,-87.6796144,14z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x880fd30e41afb9ab:0xe7048c084e9305f!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d41.9268713!4d-87.6445955!16s%2Fg%2F1tg2l7zx?hl=en",ChIJq7mvQQ7TD4gRXzDphMBIcA4,Hostel,5.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmc4Kd0jVBS7_KIGKN2Otsxcgj_kZbIoYwYDon=w150-h150-k-no-p

"*stayed here in August*

First time staying at a hostel and I was a bit disappointed. The room was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, it was for three people and it got a bit cramped. It was the private one and almost costed $400.

The parking was a big issue for us since we didn’t get a chance to pay for the parking at the hostel. Eventually we found a lot to park in a few minutes away.

The bathrooms were okay, they were clean which was nice.

My sister got the breakfast and did not enjoy it.

The person at the front counter was nice.

Chicago Getaway is now my go-to. I've had wonderful experiences here. Very affordable to have a private room that could fit 2-3 people and your clean shared bathroom is just down the hall.

The problem? The walls are paper thin. I was woken at 2am by a rowdy bunch, a guy that kept yelling at the top of his lungs that he was drunk and wanted to be taken advantage of. I was woken at 3am with someone in the next room hurling their guts out for what seemed like 20 min.

"This is a very good option for budget travelers to Chicago. The price here seems to be a little lower than other hostels I have stayed at in Chicago. It is located in a good neighborhood in Chicago about a 5 to 10 minute walk to a train station. There are plenty of stores and restaurants nearby within walking distance. The room I stayed at was basic and clean. The bed was comfortable and there was a bathroom in the room itself (not something I see at a lot of hostels) that was a very nice feature. Customer service was very good at the front desk. They have a basic breakfast in the morning with oatmeal, fruit, coffee, cereal (I have seen better breakfasts at other hostels but since the price of the hostel is lower than many others in Chicago that makes sense. Computers with internet and a foosball table and a tv room also were at the hostel.

Hidden treasure just 2 km south of Onanole and within a few minutes you are in Riding Mountain National Park.  Uniquely decorated Bed and Breakfast - lots of interesting antiques in this house.  They have 11 rooms available for rent.  Very reasonable rates for the area.  The hot breakfasts we had were well prepared - the hostess would offer different choices and took into account allergies or preferences.  We enjoyed the cheese omelette.  Nice selection of teas.  The hostess offered a cheese platter as well - extra cost - for an evening snack or appetizer.  Fresh ingredients.  The bed was very comfortable.  Some rooms have the west facing view for great sunset views.  Clean bathroom.  There are no TVs in the individual rooms - not a problem - just be conscious of this.  There is a common room with a TV down the hall for all the guests.

"One of our rooms was supposed to have a full over queen bunk but it was full over full...made it kinda inconvenient. But we had lots of couch space for people to sleep. We had a 4 bedroom condo and a 2 bedroom hospitality suite but only got 10 water park passes...they tried only giving me 8. It should have been 12 (2 per room...6x2=12) we had to buy 6 additional. No frying pans in the hospitality suite...we were done cooking breakfast by the time they brought us some. No extra toiletries, not enough for 17 people between the 5 units. Water park closed down a few times but we brought enough games to keep ourselves busy. We REALLY appreciated that they kept on top of keeping kids out of the hot tub! Fun arcade, friendly desk staff. Resort is kept up pretty well.

"Wonderful dog friendly rooms with hard to find water view balconies! We stayed in the more recently built building that is further from the outdoor pool. Clean, comfortable, spacious. The room does not provide seating (chairs, benches) inside the room other than the bed. However 2 patio chairs and small side table can be found on balcony. Quiet, relaxing, with an incredible television. Large king size bed was extremely easy to snuggle in and get awesome sleep. Water park passes (located in the other resort building) were included with our room price, but we did not have a need for those. There is no price adjustment if you do not need or use water park passes.  Also be aware: the water views are most definitely disappointing due to the building structures built between the hotel and the lake, obstructing the quality of the vacationer's view (and the roof air conditioning units constantly running in front of our rooms) but we adjusted.  Just not your standard open air, full Lakeshore experience we look for when vacationing by water. Certainly a top notch dog friendly stop when in the area!

"Family of 4 ~ kids age 7 and 3.
Stayed 3 nights over the Fourth of July 2022.
Rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly and laidback.
We spent most of the time at the outdoor pool/water park. I was able to keep an eye on my 7 year old as he went down the huge slides and played water basketball. He was able to play freely and had a great time. Kids under 48 inches are not allowed on the big slides. There is an area that has a smaller slide that kids of all ages can use and it was a big hit.
We didn’t explore the indoor water park much because the weather was so nice. However periodically there would be a 30 min break for the lifeguards and the swimmers outside. By the last day we learned the breaks were not at the same time.
Also,  adult beverages were available and prices were reasonable.  Despite a bar on site it was still family friendly.
The rule of No outside food or drinks was not enforced. Lots of families brought their own snacks and drinks down to the pool. Which I think worked out because the food concessions was overwhelmed and understaffed. The resort appeared to be understaffed in general - likely true for many places in the area right now. But like I said everyone was friendly, and pretty chill.
Lifeguards did not enforce much either and at times arguably may have been a sleep. Life jackets are allowed, and I would highly encourage them for kids who cannot swim well. My 3 year old wore a puddle jumper and it was perfect. Nearby restaurants were amazing and had a great time at Arnold’s park.

"Brides and Grooms!!!  We have been playing in Okoboji, Spirit Lake & Arnold's Park since 2005. This is definitely the new hot place to have your reception and ceremony!  They have the perfect ceremony area outside with an altar ready to go.  A perfect view of the lake right from the ballroom caps off the evening.  The staff is excellent, friendly, and very attentive.  A special thanks to Nicole who took care of us all night and made sure we had everything we needed from load in to load out.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS NEW AWESOME VENUE!

TECH TIPS FOR ENTERTAINERS... Make sure you leave extra time for a load in... There is some distance from the front door to the ballroom.  Also bring extension cords in case you need to split your power requirements between two breakers.  There is only one main outlet behind the staging area.  I ran the other cord outside to the outlet where I set up to do the ceremony.  You're going to need a 100-footer to get you back to the main setup inside.  The acoustics in the room are great, and they have full control over dimming the can lights in the ceiling and also the chandeliers over each section.   - Joey",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjN2Q3cXlRRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Bridges+Bay+Resort/@44.9761288,-97.7578315,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x878cb58ab7c398b1:0x4491ecda9765844c!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d43.3722187!4d-95.114175!16s%2Fg%2F1tf7smth?hl=en",ChIJsZjDt4q1jIcRTIRll9rskUQ,Resort hotel,5.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPixLvsH59ljXdbua-KGaNh-V9u4zm1ZTz-fgp=w150-h150-k-no-p

"We arrived late at night, so we didn't inspect the room very well before crawling in bed and falling asleep. When we woke up, I could see oily fingerprints on the headboard, something sneezed or splashed onto the TV, someone's grocery store card they accidentally left behind, and some rather dirty looking blood stains on one of the pillow cases.

The tiles and grout near the tub were a bit in disrepair, but overall things appeared tolerably clean and satisfactory unless you looked closely. I feel like the cleaning job is one of the biggest customer services a hotel can offer, because you don't want to feel like you're constantly touching other people's left behind germs, lube residue, etc. It was a major detraction.

The breakfast was okay but the lady behind the counter (responsible for cooking the eggs and everything) seemed spread very thin in her duties.

I would have preferred paying a little more at this hotel for it to be a place with a better cleaning service.

I would count this as a great quality medium-priced Hotel.  They had a great entryway and the elevator has a security code so the guests are safe.  They have a great atrium with a pool and a hot tub which is open until late including an adult swim from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. They have a full breakfast bar in the morning until 10:30 which is nice.  The rooms are modern and well-stocked with coffee maker and frigerator.  All of this was only $96 for the night.  There's also a restaurant in the hotel and a full bar.  so once you park you can really stay put for the night and not have to leave.

"We were able to book this fun hotel during an “off week”. We spent 2/5 days without leaving. They truly offer everything.

Not long after we checked in, they sent us 2 free app coupons & a bottle of champagne with a thoughtful note for our anniversary.

Our king room was clean & spacious. The bed was SO fluffy, which I loved. We had a partial ocean view which was nice bc that wasn’t what I booked. Most reviews say rooms are outdated, I guess they kind of are but it’s not terrible. Every day we walked past rooms being cleaned, like furniture flipped over & scrubbing. (I’m sure it’s easier for them to do in down time.) I was seriously impressed. The room had complementary water & coffee, a fridge, iron, hair dryer..etc Our only inconvenience was no microwave for leftovers.

All of the staff was so welcoming and kind! Someone said they were short handed, like everywhere, but we didn’t really notice until our last day when a lot more people started coming in. Even then, it wasn’t a problem for us.

The Spa! I wish we would’ve thought to book services sooner. It’s pricey but worth it!

The pools are nice & grounds well manicured. Pools close at 9 which was disappointing. We wanted to use the hot tub at night but couldn’t seem to get there before then.

The walk to the beach is easy with a nice path. We took advantage of the lifeguards umbrella & chair rentals. I believe it was $40 a day. The beach was a little crowded the 2 days we were able to go. I just thought, I couldn’t imagine how busy it would be in the summer.

Last, find the breakfast buffet! They have everything. It was wild. Lol

Overall, we would stay here again if it was in our budget & low crowds. This place is expensive along with every extra thing to go with it. It was our anniversary so we splurged.

"This is our first time staying at this location. I hope to give some thorough information as I read many mixed reviews before staying here ....
The hotel itself is slightly outdated. This can be seen on many reviews. Now, even though it is outdated, it is still VERY well kept overall. The rooms were very clean, the food areas were great and the common areas inside the hotel were beautiful. The pool areas did need attention. There were frequently plastic cups floating in one of the pools. A waterfall feature of the pool was not in use anymore and instead had many trash pieces and was starting to grow fungus looking things.
The restaurants were very yummy and service there was great. Drinks were tasty and priced well.
The biggest frustration of the hotel was the communication and activity calendar. They hand you an activity calendar and I spent much time preparing my kids for the great activities. However, most workers didn't know what was going on, some events didn't even occur. Kids crafts were free one day and then the next they were $17 to paint a canvas and make a pinwheel. The movie stated on the calendar was not the movie playing one night. It was just sad to see so many great events planned but yet, no communication and no great follow through.
Overall, I would definitely stay at this hotel many times again. I do hope that somehow they can get better communication between the workers and the events calendar. They set themselves apart having fun activities, now they just need to follow through!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1N0wzeUh3EAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/The+Westin+Hilton+Head+Island+Resort+%26+Spa/@35.0485565,-82.8899682,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88fc70894406492d:0x1aa4644ee231c7b4!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d32.2091068!4d-80.6817236!16s%2Fg%2F1tdp19tj?hl=en",ChIJLUkGRIlw_IgRtMcx4k5kpBo,Hotel,4.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPn_DJeIkLUf9t2_GT2i_EDaquvCqwKgec7FbW=w150-h150-k-no-p
"We came to Hilton Head Island for Memorial Day because we never get away for the holidays. It was such a pleasurable experience. The resort was not very busy for being a holiday weekend. There was lots of activities and there is immediate beach access.

The rooms were a little humid even with the air conditioning at 65 which made for some sticky night sleeps but still very cold for the hot weather we experienced.

The food at View 32 was excellent. We highly recommend the Grilled Cheese BLT Panini! I wish they still had the lobster roll from a few years ago when we visited but I was able to find that at a nearby local restaurant. The servers we had were also amazing!

I also had delightful experiences with Clive from the Front Desk and Madison from Guest Services. They had exceptional customer service skills which is the reason I choose Marriott!

We will definitely be visiting again!

"You pick the Westin for location location location. They are right on the beach and many of their rooms face the ocean with small porches. Some (like ours) are on the ocean, which was a great choice.

Beach access is really convenient. So convenient in fact we didn't use the pool once. The beach might be one of the best I've seen, easily beating Maui, HI. Make sure to take advantage of the chair / umbrella rental service with beach patrol. They don't ask for tips or have a tip jar, but I encourage you to tip generously. They are fantastic and work extremely hard.

The service at the hotel was extremely responsive and friendly, although the front desk was often overwhelmed with lack of concierge support, so I'd STRONGLY encourage you to submit any service requests through the Bonvoy (Marriott loyalty) app. They even found an item I left in the room last checkout, and held it for me. That rarely happens and is a sign of great training.

We used the on-property restaurant for apps and drinks, but it wasn't our thing. If you're a Applebee's or Chili's fan you will probably enjoy it, albeit they do charge resort prices. If you're a fan of Chefs that use seasonal ingredients, win notable awards, and obsess about details, you may not enjoy it.

The property was very clean, the service was extremely friendly, but the rooms themselves are really showing their age as are the furnishings. Worn furniture with slight staining and spotting is expected when staying here. To be clear, we did our best not to track sand in our room, but when we did, it would magically disappear when housekeeping tidying up the room. They were very thorough, even cleaning our windows when they got too much ocean salt on them. Well done!

The pool was always chaotic and guests reserve chairs early in the morning and don't come back until much later. There supposedly is a rule that doesn't allow this but it wasn't enforced. First come first serve.

"The hotel is not cleaning rooms. They claim that it's to address covid that they aren't doing any room cleaning during stays. But our room was still dirty even when we first checked in! So, they just aren't cleaning enough in between, either. The tub was downright grimy, there was sand everywhere, and the place doesn't smell fresh. Had very mixed service experience, some front desk staff are trying hard but some on the phone line are actually rude.

The location is great with two paths to a wonderful beach, both paths have freshwater spray to get sand off.

"Overall the hotel was nice. The front desk staff was very helpful and accommodated all of our needs. The views were amazing. The rooms were spacious and clean. Where our visit fell VERY short was our dining experience. The first restaurant we went to told us there was a 55 minute wait, even though more than half of the restaurant was empty. They told us to try the outside area so we wnt out there only to be told ""we have nothing to offer you"" even though they had empty seats as well. We went back inside and the bartender told us we could sit at a hightop table in the bar. It did take us about
30 minutes to get any service at all but we definitely didn't need to wait 55 minutes. The server was nice and the apps were very good especially the Mason jar appetizer. The mains were okay. My crab and shrimp fettuccine was SMOTHERED in sauce almost making it inedible. My husband's burger was overdone but it was still good. The one thing that was a hit was my son's NY strip and fries..that was delicious and cooked and seasoned perfectly.....the drinks were very good too!

"This was our second stay at the property, so we had expectations that it would match our previous one. That was not the case at all.

Our room was somewhat clean on arrival even though there were sunflower seed shells scattered at the entrance that remained during our stay even with multiple housekeeping visits. On our first morning, we noticed that we had not been given washcloths. Instead, there was a wet one hanging from the shower rod. Disgusting. I contacted the front desk three times and it took an hour to receive them. That’s a bit extreme. Not to mention they seemed to be surprised/bothered by the request. I know I was by the third call. There was also trash underneath the bed that we were in no way going to retrieve and neither did the housekeeping staff feel it necessary.

What happened next will go in my book of the most disgusting hotel experiences ever. While completing some emails, I noticed there was a weird yellow stain on the partially exposed mattress pad. I didn’t want to think it was what I immediately thought it was, but then I took a whiff. It was unmistakably urine. I immediately called the front desk and asked for the manager after telling them what I found. I received a call about ten minutes later saying that the manager was unavailable and that a supervisor from housekeeping would be up to check out the situation. After the call, I did a little more inspecting and actually lifted the mattress pad. That when I discovered a large urine stain directly on the mattress. Took pictures as well. I called back and informed the front desk, and while they were surprised, communicated no sense of urgency as I demanded to see the manager again to have the mattress replaced. I became tired of waiting and went to the beach for the last few hours that our rented space was available. It was my expectation that the mattress would be replaced by the time I returned. Nope! So, I called again demanding the manager and a fresh mattress. Instead, I was offered to switch rooms, to which I replied, “You want us to pack up the entire room to go to another room with a potential whole different set of problems?” Needless to say, that didn’t sit well. So, I waited some more until about 30 minutes later someone from housekeeping finally showed up to assess the situation. Again, she offered to move us and again I declined and expressly told them to change the mattress and replace the linens. After some huffing and puffing of disbelief by the housekeeping representative, a new mattress finally arrived. Then she proceeded to put the same linens that were on the soiled mattress back on the new mattress to which we had to emphatically correct that behavior, to which also was accompanied by disbelief on her part. The rest of our time in the room we just felt dirty and never really clean. Not to mention a daily vacuuming of a hotel room beachfront would have been a nice touch. Plus, I couldn’t believe that an oceanfront room was smaller than the suite we had on the previous stay, but I digress.

There were a few occasions that we ate in the Carolina Room and while the service was excellent, the space wasn’t maintained well at all. During a breakfast visit, we were seated at a table where it appeared that the remnants of the previous diner’s meal was scattered all over the floor. I’m not sure why the hostess thought that was appropriate and we were hoping that someone would notice and it at least clean up the debris. That didn’t happen. The breakfast buffet was underwhelming and we about got severely burned by the chafing dish containing the grits. The food was edible, but needless to say, we didn’t return for breakfast going forward. Dinner on the other hand was pretty good and we had particularly attentive service.

"The Westin Hilton Head Island Resort & Spa has become one of my favorite resorts. I was visiting friends and wasn't able to check-in online. After calling the staff, they ensured I was checked in and would be fine. Upon my arrival, Linda handled my check-in and placed me on the 4th floor out of 5 floors with a view of the ocean overseeing the resort. When I tell you the view was amazing I'm mean this in every way. The sunrises and sunsets were priceless! The resort was extremely clean and had staff constantly attending to any issues with cleanliness. Te onsite restaurant & bar The View 32 staff was attentive and they were amazing memorizing the food and drinks we had the day before.Drew has been working for The Westin for 19 years and he without question is one of the Top Bartenders in the country. The rooms was clean and the view was amazing throughout the property. I looked everywhere  from the hallways, walkways, around the property and everything was on point. The landscaping  was well manicured and maintained. There's a Koi Pond on the resort that had several Koi being active in the clean pond for everyone to see. Daily and continuously the staff cleaned the pool and decks around the different pools on the property. There's a heated pool, hot tube, children's pool, splash pool and plenty of beach to see. On Mother's Day the staff worked with the guest with flower arrangements for the guest. Ashley Powley was head of this project and knowing her from the Washington, DC properties. I knew things would be on point with the resort. She and the staff took time to ensure everyone was offered Mother's Day flowers  as a gift from The Westin. Marriott is doing great things to ensure a welcome on this Resort. One thing that I noticed that really had me look a few times. There were numerous weeding on this weekend and the staff was handling numerous wedding request. Attention was maintained to both the weddings and the regular guest without failure. I'm not sure if  we are working our way out of the Covid-19 pandemic has motivated everyone to get back to some normalcy or this was just that feeling of being around people created an amazing few days during my stay.The Westin impressed me and I've traveled around the world and honestly can say that this is one of my favorite places to visit. I visited a few restaurants in the area and was able to get some shopping in at the Tanger Outlets. Savannah, Ga are really close to visit if you're looking to go somewhere close by. The only challenge during my stay was Uber and Lyft who were totally unavailable the whole trip. Resort staff assisted with alternative modes of transportation.

We are Platinum members with Marriott/SPG, and this hotel really goes out of their way to acknowledge and reward that loyalty.

Had a terrific Queen Suite on the 4th floor with a balcony overlooking the pools and out to the ocean and it looks like every room has at least a decent view too.

Hotel was clean and every member of the staff were extremely friendly and efficient. Special shout out to Sophie from the front desk who made check-in an absolute delight.

Only point dropped was because the pools could use more maintenance than a clean each morning. Someone going around with a skimmer net a few times a day to clear bugs and foam from spilled drinks.

"I am writing this review while currently staying at this property. My family has stayed here every year for almost 15 years, except for last year when we opted for a private residence through Marriott’s Home & Villas because of Covid.

When I stayed with my parents as a kid, we stayed under my father who is a Lifetime Platinum Elite Status. I, myself, am a Titanium Elite Status.

I had read the recent unfavorable reviews and thought they couldn’t be true. This has been our favorite continental U.S. property for over a decade. But after experiencing it myself, I can confirm that this hotel has in fact fallen from grace. It’s amazing how the quality has decreased so much in just two years. I really wish they would have used the pandemic as an opportunity to improve the property. Each room could use a 128-point inspection similar to what mechanics do with cars.

I’ll break down the issues by category.

ROOMS

- The furniture is showing it’s age with rips, tears and stains.
- The room we stayed in the first night had a shower that didn’t drain properly. After have engineering come up to snake the tub for 20 minutes and tell us it was fixed, I proceeded to take a 5-minute shower in which I was standing in at least 6-inches of water.
- The tub also had tons of mold in the caulking. In the room we moved into the second night after they were unable to reassign the first night because the A/C went out in an entire wing of the hotel, there was black mold in the handheld shower sprayer and rust buildup on the shower head.
- We had to have the filter changed out in our first room because it was so filthy and when the engineer came up to change it, he was very snarky by saying, “See, clean filter!” as he showed me both sides of the new filter he brought up.
- The rooftop outside our balcony obviously doesn’t drain properly as there was water accumulation and rust visible.
- The room we were reassigned to had some type of markings all over the inside of the curtain.

STAFF

- I have probably had one positive interaction with a staff member (the male bartender at the poolside cafe) during the entirety of our stay, including managers. I have tried to exchange pleasantries with the housekeeping staff and received no response in reply.

FOOD

- The Carolina Room (restaurant on property) used to have one of the best breakfast buffets. Now it has been reduced to a continental breakfast in which much of the time, they are out of items. I never saw the pastries or bread containers more than half full.

GROUNDS

- The ground level of the stairwell was entirely flooded on the north end despite there not being any rain.
- The whole building could use a pressure wash.
- The pools and the beach access is the real draw of this property. However, plan to bring your own beach chairs and umbrellas unless you want to pay $40/day for them - they are not included in the $28 resort fee.

I’m so disappointed in this stay and sad to see a property I once loved become so dissipated. I sincerely hope that Marriott is taking note of all these negative reviews and will make it a priority to return this resort to its former glory. It’s obvious that staff morale is down and it shows in the condition of the property and level of customer service. In its current state, it is definitely not worth the 60k points/night it is requiring for a stay or its Category 6 designation.

Update: on our last night here, we got security called on us to our room. Why? Because the sliding tracks on the balcony doors are so difficult to open and close that the people below complained that they kept hearing something rolling. When you have to put all your weight into just sliding the door, that’s going to happen.

Update #2: Went to check-out and had three restaurant charges to our room that were not ours. Took thirty minutes to get resolved. Front desk individual was unimpressive, but the Supervisor (Miriam) that I spoke with was magnificent. She explained that the hotel was set to undergo a renovation when the pandemic struck.

What an absolutely awful experience. We go to a 10 cent slot machine and end up spinning 3 times. We cashed out after 3 spins just to go and play a little bit in other areas and got $2.50 back. We asked for help because we assumed machine error as we had only spun 3 times. It’s advertised on the machine that it is a 10 cent machine but somehow we had made the first two spins cost 37$ and the 3rd another $22. We were pointed to the credits area on the screen and told that credits were stacks of 10 cents and that we had selected it on our own…. Wildly unethical and very specifically designed to trick people and steal their money. No attempt to resolve or regain confidence once all was explained.

"We had a really great time. Everyone was so nice and friendly. Even the dealers at the table games were very helpful. We left with more money than we took. It is a very clean and very nicely laid out place. We will go back soon!
Update--- We went back for Super Bowl Sunday. This time was a lot different on the hotel side. It took us an hour of standing in line to check in. And there wasn't an hours worth of work that should have caused the issue. What caused the issue is the front desk clerks not being efficient and noticing that there was a line of about 30 people. They were also just utilizing one front desk clerk for regular guest check ins for about the first 15 minutes.
The rest of the trip was 5 stars. The casino and staff were great as always. Casino staff were very helpful and polite again. We will go back. Just someone needs to address the check in process.

The ladies at the front desk kept calling for these priority members while ignoring all the other guests and my daughter said ""We've be standing here for quite some time do you just plan on calling for diamond and seven star members only because people are literally just walking in and you're ignoring us and are we ever getting checked in?""

The table games are nice but a little high on the minimum side. Slots are hit or miss in terms of payouts. Word of advice go during the week if you can, otherwise it’s crowded and tables are hard to find.

"Quick drive from Atlanta. Fun place with table games and slots which pay out well!

Update- returned and absolutely did not enjoy. After visiting many random casinos around the country and then returning I realized that the slots are outdated as well as very tight. I never expect to win however I do expect to be entertained and have fun. Additionally, all the tables had minimum $25 bets with some at $100 min. I'll happily bet $25-$100 when I'm feeling it however mandatory on every bet can drain your stack fairly quick.

The atmosphere is also dull. I enjoy the other location in cherokee a lot more.

Back to slots. Many make you hit max bet for chance to get progressive. 90% don't have any cool bonus features. The few which  have features like spin wheel or free games rarely hit. Even if a bonus feature only wins $1 at at least gives some excitement.  This place is supposed to be fun and exciting. Additionally, most times the slots are full so very few options to even pick from to play.
Why do random casinos like in Iowa, wendover- NV, FL, CT, etc  all have new fun exciting games with bonuses, freeplay, bonus side games, etc and not here. Why do all these other places allow to hit progressives on any bet? Why do they have better music, comps, atmosphere, etc?

"Our first room the carpet was wet. Changed to another room. The beds were so worn couldn’t hardly stay in bed they were broken down at the edges. Sink didn’t drain, drawers were broken, shower handle wouldn’t stay in place for the temperature control. Changed to another room.  The toilet tank has a large crack. Air conditioner leaked so bad we laid towels down to soak up the water and it was so bad the towels could be wrung out.  Very moldy.  Found a dead cockroach the 3 night.  The morning we checked out a 4 inch cockroach came out from under the sofa. The floor was saturated for about 8 feet.  3 of us have acute sinus infections and sore throats from living in this roach and mold infested room.  The problem is they don’t have other rooms to move you to because of being fully booked. They say they will send maintenance to check the problem but they don’t show up. The place needs a major remodel. The breakfast was meh. They had a hard time keeping up with filling the empty items and rarely wiped off the tables.  I have been a Hilton Honors member for many years and have stayed many times in the Hilton family hotels. This was the worse hotel I have ever stayed in.  I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.     I also don’t understand why when I checked my review I attached photos of the wet towels and the large cockroach  they are not showing the photos on my post.

"The pros were the location, the view and the walk to the beach. We paid for an oceanfront view, and the view was gorgeous. Breakfast was also great. Most of the staff we interacted with were lovely.

I don’t usually nitpick, but I was paying $400 a night and find some things just not excusable at that price.
They don’t have daily maid service, and you have to go down to get towels/toilet paper and take out your own trash. Again, for the price I was paying, I think daily service would be expected. You can only get a full service every 5 days.
They are dog friendly, which is amazing…but there was no place to take them to the bathroom. The abandoned lot next door was what we opted for, but it was filled with thorny and burred plants. They are not allowed on the beach (city law) so there are really no options.

"For nearly $500/night, I was expecting more than the standard hotel however, it was nothing more than average.  The front desk was nice but I had to walk by an overly full garbage can when walking in, so that set the tone. I wouldn’t mind really, but it was that way every day that I was there. The can in the pool area was also overflowing by lunch and never changed until the end of the day.
This place has a smaller than average pool with very little seating. Approx 20 lounge chairs and there was room for many more. There were no umbrellas or tables In the pool area and very little shade.  There is a small bar outside that had some shaded seating. Prices for cocktails was $12+ .  Bring your ant spray, as there was an abundance of ants around the pool.  The breakfast seating area is a decent size but it doesn’t accommodate the amount of people that can stay at that hotel. I know it’s not reasonable to plan for every patron to eat breakfast at the same time however, when it’s 15-20 min wait to make a waffle or wait on some other item to come out so you can have something before they close the doors on you, then it’s a problem.
Our room had a rusted, I mean RUSTED, like throw it away it’s so rusty, lamp.

Room was very clean, gulf view, great AC, and it was quiet. Across the street are a few restaurants, walking distance to Starbucks. Publix and Walmart very close by.

Construction is starting next door on new giant condos so the peace and quiet May be gone soon….

"First of all, the few employees they had working were friendly and helpful but there were not many.   I had to go down to the desk to pick up fresh towels daily and I emptied our trash myself.   It was entirely self catering with no maid service at all.  We were there four days and nobody swept our room or even the hallway.

The room seemed clean but there were small things like the old coffee pods were left in the pots from the former visitors and one bedspread had a nasty looking stain. I took the spread down and asked for a replacement but they did not have any.

On the positive side, the breakfasts were very plentiful and tasty.  We would have liked it if the hotel had kept the coffee available all day like other Hampton Inns do but they did give us coffee packets so we could make it in our room.

We stayed in one of the suites and it was a nice room.  It's getting a little dated but not too bad.   The view from the 9th floor was wonderful.

"💙💜⛱️What a wonderful stay here! Employees are firendly at the front desk and the cleaning team.

Rooms are pretty plain and simple, but that doesnt matter. I cant imagine many people will spend much time in their room, except to sleep.🛌 The hotel🏢 is directly on the beach! 🏖👐🙌👏

A lounge chair rental service w is available for rent at $35 a day. You can walk directly from the hotel to the beach via a wooden  boardwalk w a few stairs. The white sand is so soft and the sound of the waves just took our stress away. ⛱️

Outside pool and hottub also face the beach.

Parking permit for the garage at check in. Easily elevator access frlm the garage too.

Most rooms with balconies facing the ocean are double beds🛌 instead of kings, which could be good for families.

🧽Very clean, did I mention clean!!!🧼 Absolutely will return to this Hampton when we are in town again. Very satisfied multi year diamond member here.

There is an outside tiki bar for drinks and the full beach affect too! 🍸🍷🍹

"We stayed here for several nights. It was our first visit to the Gulf Shores/Orange Beach area. This inn was a nice little place to stay.
The hotel itself is in decent condition with updated modern designs and comfort. The doors going into the room and balcony could have used a little maintenence. The room had a spectacular view of the Gulf and we enjoy the balcony alot. The pool/hottub was clean enough and a had great temps every time. Their beach area was always kept nice and we spent alot of time just enjoying the waves.
The breakfast was always served hot and there was always plenty even though we often ate towards the end of the meal time. They serve you instead of you picking what you want - Covid19 restrictions.
The only reason they are losing a star - we had to ask for everything. Since they are not cleaning the rooms and restocking supplies and clean towels each day, we were left to ask for toilet paper, new paper cups, coffee, etc. Several times it seemed as though they didn't want to get anything for us and that we were imposing on them to ask for a trash bags or whatever. I would suggest having a time frame each morning that the guests could get what they need without ""disturbing"" the front desk staff. Other than that the staff was pleasant.
One of the elevators was out of service the entire time we were there. Apparently it has been out for several weeks.. while most of time it wasn't too long of a wait, during the weekends it got a little crazy.

First I have to say the service at this hotel is excellent and mix that with the beach property I'm giving it 5 stars. You literally walk out their back door and end up on the beach. I will say that they are in need of some room updates as some of the lamp posts and bathroom rails were rusted and the box spring was pretty old.

"First the positive: Very friendly staff, above average breakfast, good location. The downside: Their attention to details is lacking. They try to keep up with cleaning, but this is a very high traffic hotel. Our room needs a good deep cleaning. Room 423. The hotel has no king rooms with gulf views. Construction noise is annoying. The pool was always cloudy. It was cleaned every morning but not well enough. The pool is to small for the number of people using it. Great to be on the beach but they charge to much for the level of service you get. Over 300.00/night for this view. 400.00 if you want to see the gulf. If the management wishes to contact me please feal free to. You have my information.

"I loved this resort up until today. I have visited several times since last year, and have never had 1 problem. My previous visits, the rooms were dated, with a musty, moldy odor. We were on the 7th floor where the toilets were way too small.  They were very low to the floor. But, Crystal Haire, the AWESOME Front Office Supervisor, was very nice and professional. She upgraded both my rooms to the newly renovated rooms, with a perfect beachview! Both my rooms are junior deluxe suits, with two queen beds with pull out lamps on both sides of the bed, one sofa bed, and two junior beds. Each junior bed has their very own tv. The bathroom has the barnyard sliding door, and the rooms are cooling much better than before, as the vent was in the corner, blocked by the curtain, and in an area where is was impossible to cool the room properly. Now there are 2 vents located in a proper area to cool the room properly. Estelle is also very nice, friendly, and personable. She works the food and beverage area. She has a great personality. It goes a long way with me. This is a great resort, in a very nice location. I have 6 of my family members here for the very 1st time. They wanted to the beautiful water. The tides were up, so We couldn't get into the water. The water was barely touching our feet, as so many others. Hilton's beach police/security drove up to us us specifically, and told us that we couldn't allow the water to touch our feet. We were all stunned, because there were so many others doing the exact same thing. Even further into the water. He drove off, and some non-blacks asked what did he say to us, and we told her. This one in particular was saddened! She said look at all these other doing the same, and some are practically swimming, and nothing has been said to them. I actually wanted to leave, and go home. We hadn't been there for 5 minutes when he came up to us. This occurred around 10 a.m., so you'll know who was on duty.  But, I'm yet here with my family. Please see pictures of others walking through the water. Prejudice is very much alive. Other than this, you all would get 5 plus stars. Hayden Edelman and Kimberly Arnold at PICNIX, the ice cream parlour were very nice, friendly, and professional.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURod29fbnRnRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hilton+Sandestin+Beach+Golf+Resort+%26+Spa/@32.3925389,-86.2624499,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88915944d557ed57:0x2eefb388f67692ce!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d30.3698031!4d-86.3274611!16s%2Fg%2F1td4384c?hl=en",ChIJV-1X1URZkYgRzpJ29oiz7y4,Resort hotel,3.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNT8pGMd5DmLO70Kiu6S0RpKGnnSi5wU6sYpssB=w150-h150-k-no-p

"The Hilton Sandestin Beach Golf Resort and Spa has my vote. I booked this place because I wanted to be on the beach surrounded by gorgeous views. This is my 4th trip to Destin, and I wanted a no worries vacation. I was able to walk right on the beach from the hotel. One can rent chairs and umbrellas from 9-5 or bring their own. The beach is super clean with powdery sand perfect for strolling, building sand castles, playing volleyball, etc. Additionally, jet ski and banana boats are available within a short few paces.

Couldn’t find the TV remote control anywhere in the room but we didn’t come to watch TV that’s just a point.

"Thanks to all the friendly staff at Hilton Sandestin for making our family spring break a relaxing and fun trip. This hotel is full of great amenities and we will definitely stay again. There are two different dinner menus, American and sushi, one place for a breakfast buffet and 2 lunch places. Also a cute café serving Starbucks coffee. There are two outdoor pools and one indoor pool, one hot tub inside and one outside. Because it’s beachside you can also get chairs and an umbrella for $45 per day, $30 for a half day after 1 pm.

"Enjoyed our overnight stay despite the cold weekend. The lobby restaurant was delicious & customer service was good. We all wanted steaks but did not realize the strict formal rules at their steak restaurant downstairs.

The sign read no open toe shoes, etc and kids basically had to sit at table at all times and could not use ipads etc and had to stay in table.

"Honestly I expected more out of a Hilton resort.

I had issues with the bathroom tub. When turning it on it spewed brown water with black particles in it. Once showering it was a race to finish and shut off the water before the tub filled up. There must have been a huge clog in the drain. After removing the drain plug myself it was absolutely disgusting.

The breakfast was not great. The service was so-so. It was difficult to get our server to the table for anything. We were flagging down other servers for help. We paid $20 for the full breakfast option and I think it was equal if not worse than a complimentary breakfast that you'd pay a fraction for at other hotels. It was disgusting and pathetic. The only thing that saved breakfast for me was the custom made  omelette bar, which also made waffles. I didn't think it was possible to screw up bacon, but somehow they figured out a way.

"Birthday shout out to my homegirl Juanita.. I had a great time hanging with her in Destin, FL the last week ... I've never been before, but she has been telling me for years that I must go.. And I am so glad I did..

We stayed at the Hilton Sandestin Beach Golf Resort and Spa. It was beautifully decorated for the holiday season and our beach view room had the most incredible view.

We weren't that enchanted with the service at first, but we spoke about our issues to the front desk and it all got better as the stay progressed. We even added on an extra night stay.

Please note: We found room service to be exceptionally on point and very hospitable. However, it was the other services such as the indoor bar, restaurant and spa we found extremely lacking in hospitality.  Thank goodness the food was great, but the drinks left a lot to be desired.

Also, we felt that the spa services were too pricey for what was being offered and no one could or would confirm if it was worth the bother.. So we didn't.

The beach was everything...Green water and white sand..❤❤❤

Inspite of those few mentioned hiccups we had a wonderful time and would return again.

"We have been coming here since 2010 and the hotel has become more crowded, more expensive, more generic, and more of a disappointment.

Honestly, the excuse of staffing or product shortages is understandable but when you’re charging $600+ per night, you need to figure out how to workaround that excuse.

The rooms leave much to be desired. Dated, you can hear your neighbors, bedding is uncomfortable, our couch had gross stains on it and had a broken armrest. Balcony clearly had not been cleaned, it was covered in bird droppings.

Horrendous service at the bar/restaurant in the lobby - it took over 30 minutes to have our server approach our table. While waiting the televisions were out of service so we were lucky enough to stare at a blank/error screen from directv. A few people asked our server if she could turn on the Stanley Cup - that request took 25 minutes to complete.

We asked the concierge to call Seagar’s and schedule a reservation for us, she did right in front of me. Once the restaurant opened I called them to verify the reservations - the host stated she had no voicemail and she couldn’t fit us in now but we were welcome to eat at the bar. So we went to the restaurant and noticed there was a dress code posted on the door - we were not in dress code and told we would need to conform to the dress code or we would not be served. Men, you must have dress slacks, closed toed shoes, collard shirt, (and a jacket is preferred) according to the host. So we left the resort and went to another restaurant. I’m fine with a dress code but educate your employees to inform guests there is a dress code, Hilton, come on. The concierge and the host (when I called) could have communicated the dress code.

The location on the beach is obviously nice, but the rest of the resort is overrated at this point.

"Love the resort. Stayed in Tivoli, which is a short walk or quick golf cart ride to the beach. Tivoli is a quieter area which we love.

"We had a great stay. The facility is highly aware of covid, which is great!

Though we did not need them, families should be aware that there are rooms with a main room and bunk beds in a cubby hole.

The staff was fantastic.  Use the concierge as they really are knowledgeable and can make arrangements.

The Front desk staff was also top notch.

There are wonderful facilities including heated pools indoor and out. Hot tubs are also both inside and outside.

There are two ramps for beach access and though it's a long walk, we walked to the state park just east of the property.

There are several restaurants on property and scores more nearby. Including a coffee bar and a sushi bar.

"Solid beach-side hotel.  Nice grounds.  Hotel staff are extremely friendly/kind.  I was there for a conference - and the conference amenities were good as well.  An attempted video-feed welcome from one of our senior execs was terminally choppy.  That was unfortunate.  In general - things went well at the hotel.  The only personal incident was a minor one... when they cleaned the room, they failed to replace the shampoo/ bodywash/ conditioner.  In the sad little moment, I actually contacted the desk 3 times in 12 hours to see if they would replace the items before my final morning.  They never materialized.
Overall - experience was good.  The lack of follow-through on a minor item makes me wonder what other gaps may be present.  Probably a great spot, particularly in the spring, summer, fall months.

"The water in Destin has been great this week. However, I can say without a doubt my family will never book at San Destin again. The hotel is fine, but they put out about 300 chairs on the beach everyday, half of which never get used. So unless you’re looking to spend $45 a day on a chair and umbrella rental, you’re confined to approximately 10 yards of sand between the chairs and the ocean. Judging by how crowded this small space is, it tells me there are plenty of sensible people here that aren’t about to pay what they want for an umbrella and chair rental.

We visited for 5 days of spring break and really enjoyed this beautiful hotel! From the start it was a great experience! The front desk attendant Mihir that checked us in was friendly and helpful and gave us the run down of what to expect at the hotel and where things were located.

We stayed in room 605. This was a King bed deluxe 1 bedroom family suite which fit our family of 4 comfortably.

This room was a great size with 2 bathrooms, bunk beds for the kids, a large living room with a pull out couch, balcony with seating, and the best part, a separate large king bedroom with private bathroom for the grown ups. This room could also be adjoined with an additional room with the connecting door in the living room for larger parties.

The 2 bathrooms were very convenient when returning from the pool or beach. There was also a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker bar in the living room as well as a table with chairs. There were 3 televisions in the room as well.

The room had a partial view of the beach from the king bedroom and the balcony. If you are able to get a higher floor it would be ideal since the pink condos do block a bit of the view. But it wasn’t a deal breaker for us since you are really here for the beach experience and amenities on property and not just hanging in the room.

This stretch of Miramar beach is beautiful and Hilton keeps their area very clean! The sand is soft, white, and a fine powder. The water is super clear and has a sandy bottom with minimal to no seaweed.

They do have umbrella and chair rentals that you can reserve online or at the counter. We booked 2 umbrellas and chairs the day of at the counter since we weren’t sure which day we would spend at the beach. We were on the second row to be side by side but if a water view matters to you, reserve online in advance. We were in and out of the water so much it didn’t matter to our family.

The water is gorgeous at this beach and filled with lots of families! Although it was spring break, we didn’t see any of the usual college crowd and later found out from some locals that this is more of a family friendly area and the hotel doesn’t rent to people under 25.

We spent a lot of time at the outdoor pool which was heated. There are 2 outdoor pools and one indoor pool. We frequented the pool near the larger tower and it was a very good size with a range of depths from 3 ft to 8 ft. There were plenty of loungers available around the pool and deck. The snack shop was steps away and had ice cream which we enjoyed as well as a the beach bar that had fun fruity drinks! We ordered a few food items with our credit as a honors benefit (shrimp quesadilla, hotdogs, fries etc) and even had drink and food service on the beach under the umbrellas which was nice! Mary at the indoor bar was also very friendly and provided great service!

We did receive daily housekeeping which was a pleasant surprise since I had read previous reviews that it wasn’t offered due to covid restrictions. We were very happy since we had lots of showers and went through a lot of towels from our beach and pool days. I am so glad housekeeping is back. It is really nice to come back to fresh towels, empty trash cans, and a nicely made bed. It makes it feel like a real vacation!

There was a slight musty smell in the room when the air was running but it didn’t bother us very much. We had great water pressure and the water temperature for showers was good.

Overall, Our whole family enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Sandestin Resort! We can’t wait to come back again for a beach break!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeXBXSFZREAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hilton+Sandestin+Beach+Golf+Resort+%26+Spa/@32.3925389,-86.2624499,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88915944d557ed57:0x2eefb388f67692ce!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d30.3698031!4d-86.3274611!16s%2Fg%2F1td4384c?hl=en",ChIJV-1X1URZkYgRzpJ29oiz7y4,Resort hotel,5.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoHErH7rbIsmtKbpHt4EMhdH7R8mvRbLUljHDV=w150-h150-k-no-p

"We reserved two large suites for our party of six.  We only had 2 nights and 2 days at the resort and wanted to spare no expense.  This was a trip that my father wanted to take his grandchildren and great grandson on after my brother’s recent passing.  He needed this to re-center himself and the family while celebrating my brother’s memory.  We had high hopes of enjoying our time together and showing my brother’s grandson his first beach and ocean.
The first night my father's shower door shattered and as a result, he received cuts on his hands, feet and torso.  Nothing serious, but since my father is 71, his skin is thin and the smallest cut will bleed forever, which he continued to do the whole weekend from multiple places.  We were down to one bathroom for 6 people for most of the trip.  They didn't have any other rooms to move us to.  Room service took 90 minutes which was unfortunate because the 3-year old in our party really needed his grilled cheese.  EVERY time we took a shower, the smoke alarm went off, either waking the 3-year old (if he was sleeping) or scaring him to death (if he was awake).  Every time I called the front desk to share the issue, the staff responded with ""yes, the smoke alarms do that because of the steam.""  Great.  If you know they ""do that,"" why not fix the problem with appropriate ventilation?
Maintenance, security/first aid team and wait staff were all very kind, but the management team was unwilling to compensate us for the terrible situation we found ourselves in at the hotel.  After everything that happened, they were only willing to credit one night of ONE of the rooms back to us.
Such a shame that customers/clients are treated so poorly. It's not like we were being cheap.  We never left the resort because we had such a short time there.  We continued to spend like crazy at the gift shop and restaurants.  We tipped generously at every turn.  Why would management treat people this way? YOU DIDN'T HOLD UP YOUR END OF THE DEAL, HILTON.  ~$700 a night per room for complete insanity . . . Scratching my head . . .
All that being said, while we were on the beach, watching my brother’s grandson play on the beautiful sand and in the gorgeous blue waters of the ocean, we were able to celebrate our family, and for that, we are grateful.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnak1iZjBBRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hilton+Sandestin+Beach+Golf+Resort+%26+Spa/@32.3925389,-86.2624499,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88915944d557ed57:0x2eefb388f67692ce!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d30.3698031!4d-86.3274611!16s%2Fg%2F1td4384c?hl=en",ChIJV-1X1URZkYgRzpJ29oiz7y4,Resort hotel,1.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMV1YIelT5o5-yDlgexsLTTDiMLmWb88Ds1lhPh=w150-h150-k-no-p

"The resort is well run with some great amenities. However, the rooms (at least the room we stayed in) need to be updated and remodeled.  All rooms were booked so we couldnt move to a new one.
The AC was leaking and the floor was soaking wet. The staff said it was from a previous occupant's cooler but it was directly below the AC supply vent and stayed wet the whole time. The room smelled like mildew. The toilet kept running and would not fill unless you removed the tank cap and jiggled the handle. The tub had been resurfaced and was peeling in large sections the edges of which would have cut you if you slipped on them. When you pushed the button to divert the water from the tub spout to the shower head the button would fly out and hit you in the leg or land on your foot...everytime.

"As a loyal hilton customer i booked this hotel putting good faith in the Hilton brand. In destin/sandestin/miramar beach area this is by far one of the best options out there if you can afford the price tag. This hotel is impressive, right on the beach with all amenities you could want including beach services from 9am-5pm like chairs/umbrellas ($39 fee plus reservation recommend ed) plus bar service. Pools are excellent even indoor pool with jacuzzi. All common spaces seem to be renovated and include restaurants, bars, sushi, gifts shops, ice cream parlor and coffee shops. Essentially if you wish to remain on resort you have everything there. Staff overall was friendly and helpful at front desk. Rooms are spectacular if you get ocean view junior suite. Only thing i was disappointed in during my 5 night stay was i attributed to lack of quality leadership of the hotel management team for not following up and enforcing nonsmoking rules. I fully enjoyed my vacation until 3rd night when more people checked in and decided to smoke cigars all day out on balcony and including marijuana at night which just filled my room up with unpleasant smell. I could not even enjoy being outside my room without smelling distasteful cigars/weed. After several complaints to staff the problem just persisted without resolution.

"Phenomenal hotel and resort!!  The customer service begins the second you drive through the entrance gate to walking into your room!  World class customer service abounds in every corner of this hotel. Rooms are super clean as well as the remainder of the hotel.  Located right on the beach, it takes ministers to get from your room to the beach.  Food was amazing as well.  I’ve pasted a picture of the omelet made by Jarrell.  Over the years, I have tried to perfect the perfect omelet but Jarrell took it to another level.  I watched him as he took order after order remembering each and every customer and serving them with a smile!  This chef was AMAZING and I wanted to highlight him on this post.  Only complaint I would have would be the rude people who go to these places and think that the people who serve them are subservient to them.  You’d be surprised (if you only took the time) to learn about them.  Many served in the military, or were professionals in their previous lives. Take the time to THANK them for cleaning your rooms, or taking your luggage to your room, or pouring you a drink.  A THANK YOU can go along way to people who provide a service to you!!!!!

"My wife and I went to this hotel for our 20th Anniversary this last week.  I was really worried about picking a new hotel since I wanted everything to be perfect for us, and it was!  From the moment we pulled up, the staff was very attentive, and quickly got us checked in.  We splurged and went with the Ambassador Suite, which was by far one of the best hotel rooms I have ever stayed in.

I cannot say enough about the Sandestin Beaches, they are absolutely gorgeous!  Even with the temperature being a little chilly, the water was still fairly warm, and walking on the soft white powder sand was a dream.

While we were there we partook in many of the hotel's amenities.  The spa was amazing, and to my surprise we had free access since I am diamond.  We also got the side by side 80 minute  aroma therapy and Swedish massage, which was probably the best massage we had ever had!  We rented a beach site for the day, and the young man who helped us out was very friendly and got us all setup very quickly.

If, I have one complaint it is that the steakhouse, Seagars, was a huge let down.  The meal was priced at what I would expect from fine dinning, but the steaks were awful, and the staff spent the entire time up-selling us and telling us how great they were, that I couldn't even get a word in edgewise.  Meanwhile the steaks were so gristly that we couldn't even chew them.

All in all an amazing place to spend a romantic get away!

"We reserved a Front Ocean view and got an obstructed view by palm trees. Called down to complain and spoke to a Jill, very rude lady
Management: Jill, one of the managers asked me to come down to the front desk area to pick up my breakfast certificates so I stopped by on our way to the beach. I guess she was busy so a nice gentleman assisted me and retrieved them for me, I counted the certificates just to confirm and noticed I was missing 2 for each day. I should have received 16 certificates (4 days x 4 guests), I only had enough for 2 guests, not 4. I pointed this out to the gentleman but he was not aware of the details and called Jill to speak with me. Jill came up to the front right side of the check in area and advised her I only received 8 certificates. She stated she offered me 2 free breakfasts each day for the inconvenience of the room type error but that our 7-year-old was free each day for breakfast (kids 10 and under are free). I said OK...but what about our 4th person? This is not what we agreed on. She lied right to my face because there was no way I would have agreed to such an offer and leave the 4th person out. I registered 4 guests for our room, why would I only accept 2 breakfast vouchers? Jill very rudely kept repeating to me, that is what we agreed on when I called downstairs. I took the vouchers and said I’d be right back with my wife and she will talk to you. My wife was PO, we waited about 10 minutes for the main manager to come out and after all that, Jill comes back out. My wife was not having it and told her we were not speaking to Jill and needed the hotel manager. After a few more minutes, we meet and start speaking with Kelcie Faulk-she seemed a lot nicer and more friendly than her co-worker Jill. We explained the entire situation to Kelcie and she said to give her a minute to sort things out and she would try and make it right (their slogan by the way). After a few minutes, Kelcie came back and apologized for everything but that she could only do 12 vouchers this time which would now cover our 12-year-old but would only now cover 3 days instead of 4. We are still livid at this point because they did not put us in the correct room type to begin with and were now going back on their promise to offer breakfast for all 4 of us for our entire stay. After a few more minutes of explaining ourselves and how we drove all this way and chose to stay at this property based on what family and friends said about it, bottom line…that was our final offer. We were tired of arguing and just wanted to get on the beach and finally start enjoying our vacation. Kelcie was very nice and showed compassion towards our situation unlike Jill but I guess her hands were tied after that final offer. We took our vouchers but did let Kelcie know we intended to make a formal complaint against Hilton and Jill. *There is more to these vouchers in the breakfast section.
Breakfast: All you hear from this hotel staff is “I am sorry about this and sorry about that” Everywhere you go, they are constantly apologizing for something-not a good sign. Therefore, I am assuming they give everyone who complains and has issues, breakfast vouchers. I’d say about 90% of the breakfast guests pay with these vouchers-you can’t miss them, they are bright blue and say “compliments” on them. So, in the end, we didn’t feel valued or received the accurate value for the room discrepancy since seems everyone got these vouchers. Get down there very early or right as they are about to stop serving breakfast because they get slammed. On our last breakfast there, we waited about 45 minutes but that was because the host screwed up and skipped over our name. I had to go up there and point out that 2 parties of 4 had gone before us when we were there before them. Our waitress was also nonexistent and not very friendly. She brought our drink orders and never saw her again until we asked for a manager about our drink refills, suddenly, she appears from nowhere.

"So far the stay has been nice. Room, view, beach and water are amazing! Jennifer Simms was able to get my room taken care of via booking ☺️.  We arrived a little early and the receptionist had us wait 2 hrs.  After those long hours Darryl Smith took care of getting our room together ❤ and apologized for the wait.  We went to get ice cream from Picnik's and I watched a young lady by the name of Savannah scratch her head, wipe her hand on her apron and reach for an ice cream cone (no gloves) and serve food 🤢, so we left.  I went over to Starbucks (they had ice cream) and a young lady by the name of Shavel was there - I watched her put on gloves to serve the customers ahead of us so that made me feel better (no one asked her to put on gloves, she did it on her own).

"This was an amazing resort! We loved it because it was very family friendly and it's right on the beach. We had a beach view balcony with the children's bunk beds and two double beds and a sofa bed. It was plenty of room for our family of 5. We wanted the one with the king bed and sofa bed but they were booked. The rooms are very very very clean. The minute we arrived it was top notch service. The indoor po was great seeing our last 2 days we had bad weather. The kids were still able to enjoy the day in the pool and when things cleared up we went back out to the beach. The bellmen were amazing.    However the restaurant in the main lobby needs to find some better help. Most of the servers just didn't seem to have the care that you would expect to find in a resort like the Hilton especially when you're pretty much dropping $25 on a some eggs and bacon.The servers were missing in action allot and I had to end up going to find one on several occasions. Dinner was the worst. It's like the servers knew they were getting a big tip no matter what due to the menu pricing so they really never came around. The other negative thing that was our balcony. It must have just been painted not too long before we got there because we walked onto the balcony forgetting our sandals and we ended up with paint on our feet.. Looks like it was just peeling and not fresh. Other than that I had no complaints.We usually Uber out to explore nearby things to do but we saved on Uber and the hassle of taking the car in and out and waiting for valet. There's plenty of shops around if you're into shopping. They have complimentary transportation available to the different resorts, golf courses, outlets, and to the village of baytowne. I recommend the village for everyone. They have lots to do for the kiddos and different restaurants to grab alcoholic beverages for the adults lol. And the best part is you can enjoy your adult beverages knowing no one is driving back. My kids are 12, 7, and 5 and they all enjoyed it. It's kind of like a mini version of disney springs (when I say mini I mean real mini version but fun for all). They have zip lining, wall climbing, a rope course, a small arcade, trampoline bungee jump, and shopping. Over the stay was great. We ended up extending our stay and have booked another week in July!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNlllMF9RRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hilton+Sandestin+Beach+Golf+Resort+%26+Spa/@32.3925389,-86.2624499,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88915944d557ed57:0x2eefb388f67692ce!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d30.3698031!4d-86.3274611!16s%2Fg%2F1td4384c?hl=en",ChIJV-1X1URZkYgRzpJ29oiz7y4,Resort hotel,4.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJvWemEDQ3kIVyLSDAV-XbavlbOsyWmLvip2P-=w150-h150-k-no-p

"What a special and memorable experience!  Newly redecorated room with new carpet and furniture.  Great views from every room, nice pool area, spa and restaurants!  Secluded and secure property with excellent beach access just 20 steps from the patio.  Gated access to the expansive resort property with private homes, villas, lakes, and lots of green space.   This place feels like home the minute you drive in, and is has a very exclusive country club type of feel.  You will love it!  Close to lots of shopping and restaurants if you have a car, or take the shuttle which runs every 15 minutes around the property.

Thank you to the whole team.
I enjoyed all the guest areas .  I enjoyed the ocean view room for the view and very spacious.  Dated lamps are worn  and little things around the room. The only thing I didn’t like was the musty smell of water, wet carpet.  The bathroom could of been cleaned better. Behind the toilet where there’s caulking is mildew.  My room was on the fourth floor ocean view so we had the ultimate view.  I really enjoyed it here. I hope the hotel will be updated soon. I work in hospitality and I understand that this industry was very much affected by the pandemic and not mention storms that haven’t helped and it’s slowly getting more people hired and getting the experience staff hired and trying make revenue as well.

Now, the size of the room for the price and the pictures could be better adding that the room did not have a balcony and the bathroom was perfect for my 5 feet even but not for a taller longer leg person. I was hoping pet friendly meant everywhere but we har to leave my emotional support mini golden doodle in the room several times.

"My family and I enjoyed the brief time we spent here. The amenities were a plus, the views were amazing, and the location was convenient. If you book through a third-party beware. If your room type isn’t available you’ll have to pay extra per day to get the amount of beds you need. Also, all the staff was nice from the valet to bellhops EXCEPT for the West Indian woman in the front. After two interactions with her I can confidently say her attitude is terrible. It’s like it pains her to smile.

"This hotel is mismanaged and full of hidden fees. Two of the elevators in the south tower have been out of operation for at least a month. It can take up to 20 minutes to get an elevator and there is a line for the elevator at peak times. McDonald's are managed better. The entrance is so small that we had to sit in line out in the road waiting for the hotel. This is a hazard for guests and a liability for the hotel. I do not understand why this is a Hilton when it I haven't experienced this mismanagement at extended stay. The pool was nice but not very deep. The hot tub was small. The parking was extremely expensive. The food in the hotel is also expensive. There are no proper heaters in the rooms so if it is cold, you will suffer. We called the engineer and he said they have toaster ovens for heaters in the rooms. His quote.

"This place was way below our expectations we decided to spend a little more and stay at a known hotel line rather than risking it with an unknown place just to enjoy our weekend away. And we were WRONG, the picture attached of the rusted bathroom equipment was just 1 of many unacceptable issues.

Service: the worse, upon arrival they were very flat not very welcoming this place is huge with different things going on and no one even told me anything I had to figure out where and what everything was. But that’s not even the issue. House keeping is almost impossible to get I’ve never been to a hotel where you have to call a specific number to request it within a restricted time frame. Zero small bathroom/shower supplies. We were charged 40 dollars a night for valet parking and no one even answered the phone when we had a dinner date to get our car so we had to walk to the actual place then wait for the car.

The restaurants and bars mind you that are already over priced have awful service because they are SOOOO understaffed this one poor man was literally running the entire Resturant and bar while getting yelled at. The one pool bar they had, there were like 10-12 people wrapped around in a line just to get one drink by the pool in the hot heat so we said forget it the second time 😩 The first night on arrival when I tried to take a quick rinse/shower  the water stopped draining.

But other than that the room wasn’t dirty the sheets were clean that’s all I gave you guys sadly. And I’m not one to leave reviewed but I HAD to give the next people a heads up.

Also i mentioned it to the manager and she didn’t even offer anything she said “I’ll talk to house keeping “. Most other places would at the very least try to make up for the bad service to protect their standards .. not at all.

"Leaves a lot to expect, this has been a worse experience than other Hilton hotels, at first we booked a room on the city side part of the hotel but instead they placed us in a practically subterranean room, which smelt moist and had dead bugs on the bed. We later came to find out it had flooded during a recent hurricane. We got moved to a room on the 7th floor which is even more outdated and gross than the first, muggy, and seems to be a remnant of the late 1990s. To make matters worse after having been given the run around at this hotel for about an hour late at night.... The shower is disgusting to shower in. Stay away from this Hilton hotel. It's in serious need of actual attention.

Edit: my wife found bed bug bites all over herself....

"First off.....we decided to stay AFTER spending $300 on a time share tour that we are not going to do because after calling to book it over the last 3 months theres no availability every time we call. So.... Being Diamond members who decided to spend over 400,000 points on our room. We asked to extend our stay when we first got here and was declined. But as Diamond members we are guaranteed a room if requested within 48 hrs. Secondly, in our suite since we arrived the A/C has not worked. It has gotten up to 75-76 and has been set at 64-60 respectively our poor little one is all sweaty during her nap, it took having engineers come to our room 3 times over 2 days without an offer to switch rooms until they fixed it towards the end of our trip. At night it got a little chilly so I asked for 2 more blankets and they were out! So they gave us some bed sheets?!?!The Wi-Fi is absolutely garbage! It cuts out like every 10 minutes, then you have to re-sign in. The beds were absolutely horrible and honestly as a Diamond member it didn't feel much different than a regular member. I will say the employees from the valet to the room engineers/maintenence and in between were kind. But, overall I'm pretty upset about spending over 400,000 points as a Diamond member. And I am seriously considering switching credit cards with a different hotel chain! I will be following up with Hilton corporate if no refund of points are offered.

"My family of 6 just finished a 5 night stay, to say we were underwhelmed is an understatement. We happen to be a hardworking blue-collar family, so when paying $629.00 a night for a suite at the Hilton, we were really excited to experience a stay that's above average to our typical Redroof or Days Inn stay. At arrival I was declined a military discount, not absolutely a deal breaker as I was told I was already receiving good deal by the front desk. Of course we were in town for a work conference and were also denied the block rate supposedly due to the fact that we had a suite (the only Accessible room available at the time of our reservation). Next, we arrived in our suite and had to use the restroom after our 16 hours of travel, only to find that housekeeping has definitely not done a very thorough job cleaning the toilet. Ok, fine. I pulled out some Clorox wipes and took care of it myself. At the same time, we noticed the room was excessively hot, so after settling in we called the front desk and notified them that the ac was not working, she said she would send an engineer up to check it out. At 230am when we still hadn't seen the engineer, we went to bed leaving the door open for a breeze to cool the room off. (The ac automatically turns off when the patio door is open, this was not the reason our ac was not working as we had complied with troubleshooting from the front desk) It wasn't until 2 more calls to the front desk and almost 2 days into our stay that the ac was worked on and worked at least enough to make the room bearable. Next up....showers, nothing like stepping out of a nice warm steamy shower to briefly look up when drying off and seeing black mold.......gross. Room service was not an option during our stay, a bit of a bummer as the kids were looking forward experiencing that. On the flip side we ended up dining down in the Don Ricos. It was a bit pricey at $14.00 for a pb&j sandwich with fries for the kids, needless to say there are lots of other options outside the Hilton for food choices and we made that choice for the remainder of our stay. The kid zone was non existent, the kids were really bummed about that as it was one of the reasons we had chosen to stay at the Hilton. The elevators were in a state of broken or in repair a couple times during our stay leading to extra long wait times to get to the lobby. We made our reservation for 6, had a suite for 6, paid the additional fee to have breakfast included but were informed it only included 4 so we didn't dine as a family for breakfast.

The good: At check in the kids were all given a fun craft to do, which they did and thoroughly enjoyed. Our request for extra towels and blankets was met quickly and our interactions with the staff were pleasant. The location was great as it's was very central for the things we needed to do. The beach was fantastic even though access was very limited due to damaged walk ways.  Last but most important, the unobstructed view of the ocean from our suite was fantastic.

Lesson learned, we won't be returning.

UPDATE: I called the number provided by the Hiltons response to my review. I was quickly forwarded to the manager on duty without any prolonged holding. Brooke I think, (I hope that's how her name is spelled) spoke with me for about 20 min as I recounted our stay with them and the reasons for my review. She was open to hearing what I had to say and did not discount or deny the experience we had, which was refreshing! At the end of the conversation, she let me know I would receive a partial refund (which I have received). She handled my call with complete professionalism and kindness.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobWFlaWZBEAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hilton+Daytona+Beach+Oceanfront+Resort/@32.3925389,-86.2624499,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88e6da15b9f63f63:0x7f69da011a21aa8b!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d29.2302161!4d-81.0094812!16s%2Fg%2F113j35m45?hl=en",ChIJYz_2uRXa5ogRi6ohGgHaaX8,Hotel,1.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2RrF8cYUMaMR2E9UJSguH-OLFERLXvd7bTYsS=w150-h150-k-no-p

"I've been to better Hiltons. I'm a Hilton Honors member; however, I came with a large group for a special conference.

Check in was lengthy. I understand a conference puts a lot of strain on the staff, but waiting an hour in line is a bit much.

The room was so-so. Quite a bit dated and the shower/tub was tricky to navigate. The sides of the tub were high and there were no grab bars. I am not physically challenged, but grab bars would have helped me a great deal. I loved the fact that they had an extra sink outside the bathroom, though.

Time to buy new towels. These had seen their day.

One of the elevators in the north tower did not work, which slowed down the long lines of people waiting to get upstairs. Thankfully, one evening, they had an employee directing ""traffic.""

I was pleased to see a coffee machine in the room as the last Hilton property I stayed at didn't have one.

I was disappointed to see that room service was by request only. Hilton's rationale (by their signage) was that people could customize their experience according to their comfort level; however, I believe that it is simply to save money.

You have to give them 24 hours in advance to request housekeeping services, so I tried calling housekeeping immediately after checking in only to be greeted by a ringing phone. After the phone rang 30 times, it transferred to a real person. When I explained that no one was answering the phone, I was told that housekeeping would be contacted.

We never had housekeeping for the rest of our stay. I was so caught up with my convention that I didn't have time to contact a department for a service I believed I should automatically been getting anyway.

The room was clean but the windows were not and the oceanside area (I can't call it a terrace because you can only stand) looked like it could use a good scrubbing. The refrigerator was banged up and looked like it was brought in from a college dorm after it had been well used.

Also, more outlets are needed.

The downstairs area is quite nice, and I loved the gift shop. Most of the items were reasonably priced and they had a large variety.

However, the amenities at this resort are to numerous to mention and you will find spending a week at this beach Front resort is very relaxing If you are in need of a vacation.

"This is a sincere review. If you seriously want to stay here read this. For many reasons i have to give this place 1 star. I'm just going to list them below. If you're like me and plan to be on the beach during the day, have fun at night and supply your own food for all but dinner, this isn't the place for you. If you want to just show up with clothes and a wallet full of money than have at it. Because this place is pretty aggressive at gouging prices.

1. Advertised parking $20, real self parking was $30 per night(not garunteed  parking spots after purchase, and it's 2 blocks away) valet $40.

2. If you get valet, check is super early. A line stretched past the hotel for at least 1.5 miles waiting for parking.

3. It took an hour to check in, (kind of my fault since it was right at 4p.m)

4. No microwave in the room (to make you use the resturaunts)

5. This place is super scammy. Plan to spend at a minimum an extra $45 a night for parking + a $15 charge for using amenities like the pool or gym.

6. Resturaunts they have are super pricey

7. The beach in front of the Hilton is taken up by a predatory beach rental company that charges $30 for 2 hours to use 2 chairs and an umbrella.

"TL:DR   Extremely nice hotel but you will pay extra for ABSOLUTELY everything.

Long review: I cannot leave a rating higher than 3 stars. I debated going either 1 star higher or 1 star lower but I am trying to be fair. We stayed at 3 different hotels in a one week period in the Ormond Beach/Daytona beach area. If you just want to kick back and go to the beach and sightsee, your money is much better spent elsewhere. Here you will pay $25 a night for the privilege to park 2 blocks away or 35 for on-site valet parking. Use of the 2 pools and hot tubs, another $25 a night. Breakfast is not free but I assume it is excellent depending how much you are willing to spend. If you do plan on spending significant time on the beach, I recommend the beach level cabana rooms because the only way back to your room is through the very nice lobby and you will feel like a Philistine, dragging 3 kids with their dripping bathing suits and sand toys behind you. The rooms are no nicer than a moderately priced hotel with free parking and breakfast.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdnByWnRnRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hilton+Daytona+Beach+Oceanfront+Resort/@32.3925389,-86.2624499,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88e6da15b9f63f63:0x7f69da011a21aa8b!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d29.2302161!4d-81.0094812!16s%2Fg%2F113j35m45?hl=en",ChIJYz_2uRXa5ogRi6ohGgHaaX8,Hotel,3.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdDVCcxwmVPl6MxXE4BPswpM3nDHUeACSZMJ94=w150-h150-k-no-p

"Not really impressed for the amount of money it costs. You have to pay, per day, to park your vehicle either via valet or in the lot across the street..$25-$35/day! Depending on the size of your vehicle, you may obly be able to park across the street because they said our truck was too big for the parking garage. Parking across the street is fun when lugging things from hotel throughout your stay. It also was not very well kept. Lights were out, drug baggies on floor, food in hallways and when you look out the windows, you'll see lead cords everywhere that operate the lights outside the hotel.

"We stayed here for 4 days while we were in Daytona for Passion Camp 2021. Overall the stay was pleasant. However, the bathroom wasn't as clean as it could have been. It may have just been old age, but it didn't seem like the bathroom floor had been really well cleaned in a while. The area around the bottom of the tub, especially on the end with the water spigot, was dirty, as well as the area around the legs of the bathroom counter in the toilet/shower area.

It was nice to have two separate sink areas- one in the room with the shower/tub and toilet, and another just outside the bathroom.

All the staff I encountered were very nice and willing to help with whatever I needed from them.

I did see what appeared to be a tiny roach or two in the bathroom.

The trashcans in the bedroom and bathroom were extremely small, considering there were 4 of us in the room, and we spent 4 nights there. Housekeeping didn't come every day, so our trash was overflowing at some points. I'm not sure if Covid guidelines require housekeeping to come less, or if that's a regular procedure.

The pool area is nice and spacious. There was an employee on duty, handing out towels.

The location to the beach is almost perfect.

The convenience store/Starbucks needed more registers, because the line was extremely backed up in the mornings.

Overall, we were pleased, and we will probably stay there again.

"Great location on the beach with great ocean views! However, be prepared to wait forever to check in. We noticed lines were long at the front desk during our stay. Rooms are dated and not up to Hilton standards. Furniture is old and beat up, light fixtures in the bathroom were rusty, the pipe holding the shower head was moveable and coming out of the wall, and the bathroom itself is a very tight space. Windows/sliding door were covered in ocean spray (which is understandable) and the balcony is not really a balcony. However, it was nice to open the door and get a fresh breeze in and hear the waves!

The pool is way too small for a property this size and there was black algae all over the pool tiles. It is in serious need of repair. The hot tub was closed during our stay. The loungers are dirty with cigarette holes in some of them. There was food and cigarette butts on the ground in the pool area first thing in the morning so it appears no one cleaned the deck before the next day.

All of these negatives aside, the common areas of the hotel including the lobby were fine, and like I said, you can’t beat the location!

You will pay another $25 PER NIGHT to use the 2 pools and hot tubs. Breakfast is in the hotel restaurant and it's not free. Room service charges $25 for a chicken breast entree. If you want to spend time at the beach, the only way back to your room is through the very nice lobby. Try dragging 3 kids in dripping bathing suits and sand toys through there everyday, you Philistine. Finally, WIFI is on a two tier system, good WIFI is $6, 1995 wants it's WiFi back is free. When, we arrived on a Thursday night, there was some problem with the bellhops (not really a problem), but we were informed by the valet that, because of prior lawsuits, there were no luggage carts available for guest use either. Really? Lawsuits?  There is a Starbucks in the hotel, so if by this point in your stay, you have 5 dollars left, yeah, it's gone now.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdnQ2LVNREAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hilton+Daytona+Beach+Oceanfront+Resort/@32.3925389,-86.2624499,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88e6da15b9f63f63:0x7f69da011a21aa8b!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d29.2302161!4d-81.0094812!16s%2Fg%2F113j35m45?hl=en",ChIJYz_2uRXa5ogRi6ohGgHaaX8,Hotel,3.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN96WP5-7ROms9Hj8nhbY2AkSLo1sxzdy1UtPM5=w150-h150-k-no-p

Amazing staff!! The resort as a whole is dirty and over priced! This is the worst Hilton property I have stayed at. I am so disappointed. Pool had not been cleaned all three days of my stay.

"Definitely 3 stars for a 3-star experience. “Dirty Daytona” lives up to the stereotype. Lobby and common public areas all look great and clean and feel up-scale but the rooms leave some to be desired. Doesn’t feel like they’ve been remodeled in quite a long time. Some of the bathroom tiles are chipped. The mirror has those brown crusty, faded edges. The carpet is flat and thin, so you really feel the concrete floor. The bar and restaurant have decent options, but all overpriced as you’d expect. The little market for coffee / pastries was great and the cute older woman with the accent was AWESOME. Loved seeing her every morning for coffee. Valet was unreliable; often wouldn’t pick up the phone or when they did, would transfer time to the wrong valet station.

Would I go back? Eh. If there was no vacancy anywhere else and I absolutely had to stay in Daytona beach, maybe.

"Comparing this Hilton to other Hiltons, I'd say this one falls a bit a short. And it's unfortunate because the location is perfect. However, the amenities that are available are short staffed and not open the hours that they should be. They also are never all open at the same time. Also, one has high expectations for Hilton such as cleanliness, and up to date furnishings. This Hilton falls short. It's not what I was expecting at all. Valet was full and self park is a block away. They charge 25.00 a day for parking, 30.00 for valet. They still charge resort fees even though all the amenities aren't even available. No spa open at all, etc. This Hilton has so much potential but cleanliness and updating, especially in the South tower, needs work. Housekeeping is probably short staffed, but things aren't as clean as they state. Hallways need seriously vacuumed and attention to detail as well as the elevator floors. Sliders on balcony are dirty with hand and and finger prints and ocean spray in room. Guests expect these standards from a Hilton given the prices that we pay. This Hilton is just getting worn down and needs some tlc. I've included some pics of my bathroom and my room just as examples.

"The good:
Location location location
Staff is friendly
Base rate was good (I say base rate because of what will be mentioned below)
Room size was larger than expected and great view (double edged sword because of AC issue detailed below)

The bad:
A/C in our room was horribly sub par.
Rooms are dated.
Hallways are hot and muggy like our room was.
Resort fee $25/day.
Parking fee $30/day - offsite surface lot 2 blocks away.
Check in while well staffed and friendly was worse than a Vegas mega property.
Wi-Fi was practically not usable (Probably due to room location)
Great view was obscured by windows that were last cleaned who knows when.
Valet line was literally 3 blocks long at check in.

I was lured in by a Priceline deal and won’t ever make that mistake again. Ended up paying $110 over my prepaid rate in parking and fees. This property is dirty, tired, and absolutely not worth what I paid. All in I paid $388 for 2 nights after taxes and fees. I should have stayed at a Hampton and it would have been comparative per night with parking and breakfast included.

I covered the good and the bad…
The ugly? See images of the AC outlet in our room and the windows. It was putting out cool air but blowing so underpowered compared to the room size that we were miserable. Maintenance checked it said sorry nothing we can do we’ll ask housekeeping for a fan. No fan came and no one called. I just gave up at this point.

We spent 45 minutes in line before driving into the front door and  when we’re finally in front we are told the self parking is across the street so basically we wasted 45 minutes of our time. You get a bunch of emails before arriving but they don’t tell you how to actually arrive and park.

"I would have rated this resort as 5 stars because of how pet friendly it is.  We were so impressed with the number of guests that brought their fur babies with them.  It was so nice and our little fur baby also enjoyed making new friends. So we will definitely be back.

One thing that I was not so excited about was how the rooms really need some up dating to them.   The bathroom more importantly.   Three mirrors, and shower time had black stuff and there was rust on some items and the cleaning was not very detailed.   The corners in the bathroom showed this.   Overall, the resort is a great.

"I give this place a three only because of the location. The hotel rooms are dated, and the oceanfront rooms don't have balconies. I believe the lady at the front desk said they only had a few with balconies. What's the point of an oceanfront room if you don't have a balcony. I assumed it did when I booked an oceanfront room. The rate they charge is not worth it without a balcony. Also, the bar downstairs wouldn't serve you alcohol unless you purchased a meal! We already had dinner and wanted to walk downstairs and have a drink to unwind. We were turned away because we refused to buy a meal.

Problems with no microwave in every room, mini fridge though room capacity for larger, no pad paper, body wash or enough wash cloths when checked in had to ask for some, flimsy closet door kept coming off track, rust/hole behind base of bath door & very limited TV access without paying extra per view.

Your staying at the Hilton and depending on when you book your gonna pay between 2 and 4 hundred bucks a night. This place is beat. It needs an overhaul. Beat up furniture, rusted lamps and chipped tubs. If you can over look price and a beat up room for location, than you cant go wrong but for the price I expect better from.Hilton.
Update 3.24.22.  Rooms.still need updated and prices went up.  Booked 2 months out for our event and they wanted $400 a night trough Hilton even with Honors. Found it on Trivago through booking.com for 309 a night.  Hilton wanted to match not beat. (Lame) and it would of been alot of work. Total hassel save yourself some time and just go to trivago.

"My hubs and I along with a few other couples used this hotel for a weekend getaway. The staff is very friendly...valet, front desk, bartenders, security officers, store/restaurant employees...we have nothing negative to say about any of them. The hotel location is in a fantastic location, close to everything. The boardwalk is behind the hotel, several souvenir shops and quick bites are just steps away, many restaurants are walking distance, movie theater next door, and much more. They have live entertainment every night and the hotel bars and restaurants are excellent but pricey. If you stay at this hotel I insist you pay the extra cost for a beachfront view. It is worth it. The view is amazing! The sunrise is breathtaking, the sound of the ocean is mesmerizing, and if your lucky you can see a fireworks show from your window.  I give a 2 star rating because of what most people mentioned...the parking situation.  You are almost obligated to do valet parking which is $24 a day cause if you pay the $17 a day self parking you are in for a long walk and wondering if your car is safe where it is at. The parking isn't even located on the premises. It is across the street and to the left of the hotel.  A ways walk if it is super hot or raining. Not to mention that you have to carry all your luggage.  Also I think that the hotel is in need of an upgrade. The rooms are very outdated. I wouldn't say that the rooms are very clean. They could be cleaner but it may look this way because of the outdated furniture and decor. The lobby seems as though it has been renovated. And lastly, I can not believe that wifi is an option and has to be paid for.  A hard pill to swallow when the cost of the room is pricey.

"PROS:  The location is PRIME!   It is right on the boardwalk and convenient to the amusement park next door and the pier.  The breakfast buffet is TO DIE FOR!

CONS:  (none of which merit giving this resort less than 5 stars).  The resort itself is quite dated, so don't expect fancy rooms, but -especially for a beachfront resort- the common areas are in good shape.  Expect to pay exorbitant prices for everything within the resort, as goes with any vacation resort.

TIPS:  I definitely recommend spending the money for valet parking because the self-parking is a good distance away and terribly inconvenient (and isn't that much cheaper).  Try and get a room on the upper floors, beachfront, because the view is great!

"Not as well maintained as I've come to expect from  Hilton, but still very much clean and friendly. Parking sucks and cost 30 a day to valet. You can find a garage across the street maybe but it's iffy when bike week or other events happen. Even in a pandemic. Close to Joe's and in the mix of all thing on the beach. We loved our visit and the fact we could sleep with the sliding balcony door open. The ocean put me right to bed. No insomnia. During the ""pandemic"" it was a little slow for how it normally is in Daytona. But that didn't stop us. No no no.

Edit..... thank you for the apologies but I dont feel you owe it. ""what we have come to expect"" was poor word choice. Smart rooms are all the rage.

"Our experience at The Hilton Dayton Beach Resort was AMAZING!,,it FAR exceeded our expectations! The front desk staff was on POINT! (Miss Jereake at check-in was AMAZING!..and Miss Amanda at check-out was great). Our room was spectacular. The pictures on the website do NOT do these rooms justice!  We had an ocean-view double queen and it was perfect!. Clean, updated, well designed, had all that we needed while staying.  The bathroom had a little separate powder-room which was perfect for me to get ready while HE showered. The mini-fridge was perfect for our snacks and pop and what-not.(pictures below) The hotel itself was breath-taking when we walked in. The reviews often claim the self-parking-lot is far,,,but it was NOT! It's a half-a-block from the south-tower-entrance. IT WAS FINE!!. the restaurants were awesome with great staff (the only point of contention was the cup of ice water given at the whisky bar. it tasted like FL.tap water and though I only had one sip and ONE alcoholic cocktail I was VERY ILL about an hr after getting back to the room. stick to drinking bottled water ANYWHERE in FL,. if its in a cup or glass, pass..but not Hilton's fault!). The Hyde Park restaurant was SO AMAZING!. and at check out there were SEVERAL charges not made by us and it was a very simple and quick fix for them to check that days receipts and adjust (seems as if the SAME gentleman wrote the wrong room number on his receipts; maybe he didn't know his room number, a mistake, maybe one too many cocktails,,either way the manager Miss Maria took care of it swiftly.) The pool was perfect...not to busy and big enough for everyone there.

"The look is nice driving in is a little awkward and small area, you end up lined up out into the street, they need better organization with the valet crew. Also, not explained right a way that self parking is a little jaunt down across the street in or by the public beach parking.

Young lady that checked Me in was not very thorough with information, she was offered help but she declined, in which resulted in mistakes and misunderstandings.

I called down when it wasn't busy for an extra blanket that never was received.

The housekeeper for where my room was wasn't very good. Prior trash from last guest was left under the desk. Along with their hair in the tub and around the toilet. Kinda not a very clean feel.

Breakfast time, meh was not the greatest experience, I ordered simple off the menu, 2 eggs OM, white toast, avocado slices and hot tea. Took kinda forever and it hadn't gotten busy just yet. The Boys had the breakfast bar didn't care for it thought the food to be less desirable and of cheap quality. Also, the waitress seems to skimp on the change returned. My Son (13), was picking up the tab as a treat so it was important to Him to get all His change. I can see maybe missing 1 or 2 cents but she kinda jipped Him of 9 cents🤦🏽‍♀️ kinda worse than Chipotle rounding up and keeping your change.

Best part...

Boys thoroughly enjoyed the swimming pool, hot tub and easy access to the Beach.

Evening Seafood buffet was delicious, I didn't need to order the crab legs. I had sufficient amount of succulent Lobster and Shrimp.

The bell hop guys was extremely helpful and nice. Conversated with my Boys as buddies made them feel comfortable.

"I usually avoid these corporate giant hotel chains, but with COVID-19 they were one of the only ocean views still open in April, so my lady & I reserved a standard King Bed ocean view. Came to $125 with my FL Resident discount. They did waive the outrageous $25 per day resort fee since no amenities were available, but still charge the daily parking fee. These extra charges are why I avoid such places & stick to quiet low-key motels, but they are closed currently due to no travelers because of COVID-19. Fortunately no crowds at least. Hotel is dated, tho our room was clean. They should have the pool open since FL leaves that decision to the owner, there is no ""shut down the pools"" order by the state or county. With 4 or 5 guests in the whole hotel and being that chlorine kills viruses, it would have been nice to use the pool. When I reserved the room on the phone they tried to upsell me on ""Vacation Ownership"" too which I of course turned down, being that I already hated having to pay $100 in parking fees for a 2 day stay (2 vehicles)  They get 3 stars because the room was clean, view was good, no tourists to ruin the chill quiet I wanted & the front desk lady was nice.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjcThQLWx3RRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hilton+Daytona+Beach+Oceanfront+Resort/@32.3925389,-86.2624499,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88e6da15b9f63f63:0x7f69da011a21aa8b!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d29.2302161!4d-81.0094812!16s%2Fg%2F113j35m45?hl=en",ChIJYz_2uRXa5ogRi6ohGgHaaX8,Hotel,3.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvhZPOmi-6oeeOUstdg-R4ueSAluHYrBA181fR=w150-h150-k-no-p

"Very clean place, right in front of ocean, decent family place.
Few points to note
1. There is paid/ valet parking on premise.
2. Self Parking is paid but is opposite to the premise beside a barbecue place. They might not charge you for self parking make sure you speak with them on that point.
3. Breakfast is Paid but available
4. Clean your sand in shower area located near hot tub area downstairs
5. Kids have a pool and play area on 5th floor.
6. We were playing with our kids in the pool area downstairs and a guest felt annoyed and suggested us to take them upstairs. Well there is no restriction like that , there will always be people like that around.
7. Staff were all friendly and nice
8. Towels are available for guests in pool area.
9.People walk on streets at all times , some of them were drinking too.
10. Walk early morning to Pier near to it . It's cooler in mornings if you plan to hit the ocean.
11. Not all ocean rooms have open Balcony. But still it's a beautiful view, unless you are planning to open windows and sit there, Ocean view rooms are Pricy than normal ones. Save some bucks if you are planning to spend a long time outside.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0LU9tY2ZBEAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hilton+Daytona+Beach+Oceanfront+Resort/@32.3925389,-86.2624499,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88e6da15b9f63f63:0x7f69da011a21aa8b!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d29.2302161!4d-81.0094812!16s%2Fg%2F113j35m45?hl=en",ChIJYz_2uRXa5ogRi6ohGgHaaX8,Hotel,4.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-UmfW9e8H_UBDqi7WQ5tGE8b-13eZwvp1yq8D=w150-h150-k-no-p
"The staff at the Hilton Daytona Beach Resort is exceptional, therefore you should expect to tip well for great service. The room was clean and of normal size for a hotel room. We had an oceanfront room with a view to die for, right in front of the clock tower (Room # 517). The pool at the south tower offered a shaded area and towels were continuity available. The hot tub is slightly hidden and temperature was always perfect. I'd certainly consider staying here again.

As far as cons... There was almost no water pressure in our room. We even went as far as removing the shower head but that only left a single stream of trickling water. We specifically booked an oceanfront room with a balcony, as it was advertised/described, but were extremely disappointed in what they called a balcony. My 4 year old barely fit on the ledge with railing (aka balcony); fully grown adults can stand in the sliding glass door to enjoy the view. See pics attached for ""balcony"" and view. The price of parking is quite high ($24 for valet per day, whether you leave or not) plus tipping when you do require your vehicle throughout your stay. With the cost of parking plus resort fees and taxes, expect to pay an additional $40+ per day. If you require a cart for your luggage, expect to tip again as the carts only come with a bellhop (as we were told). Mixed drinks at the pool are $12 each. The pool at the north tower is rooftop with no shade, so we avoided this pool during our stay June 18-22 (too hot and too much sun).

Finally... Location... This hotel is conveniently located to many additional restaurants, the boardwalk, waterpark and more. This also meant a lot of people and noise. We tend to prefer a quieter area of the beach. We also experienced a large amount of local ""beggers"" on the edge of the property, near the beach entrance. They were quite rowdy and drunk making it difficult to enjoy the view from the boardwalk. Additional, outdoor seating on the Hilton property, separate from the pool and restaurants would be nice.

Overall, nice stay.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnMmQtQnhRRRAB,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hilton+Daytona+Beach+Oceanfront+Resort/@32.3925389,-86.2624499,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88e6da15b9f63f63:0x7f69da011a21aa8b!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d29.2302161!4d-81.0094812!16s%2Fg%2F113j35m45?hl=en",ChIJYz_2uRXa5ogRi6ohGgHaaX8,Hotel,4.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkxLEHQvcs98YgKy8fm5oBYJ0P8LJf0Q0ntPpu=w150-h150-k-no-p

"Lack of attention to details, cleanliness, service, and poor guest enjoyment experience. Overall my first experience here was very disappointing.  There is no valet parking, even the hotel knows about my long stay does not have at least one parking lot for guests, they seem sold to the public.  The registration process took so long, even the girl was humble, the process took a long time, it was the need to call the manager.  No explanation or welcome about the hotel and amenities.  After an hour, we have to find the parking lot across the street.  The hotel has many, many, many balconies, and my room was the only one assigned with glass, and the worst thing was it was super dirty, I couldn't enjoy the sea view.  The room was not completely cleaned.  The bathroom has intermittent lighting.  The only good thing was the hot breakfast that we paid extra.  The digital key was not working.  The pool had no control of the hotel staff, it was not known if all those people in addition to filling the pool if they were unregistered people from the hotel.  The gate and access to the pool without security or control.  I do not think I will stay in this hotel again even though it has a good location and view.

"Bedbug nightmare for 7nights. Room is smelly and very old. Got a bedbug bites in a room and went to reception at 7am and reception said they will check, but nothing happened and we had to spend one more night  with bed bugs. Went to reception again at 7am next day and had to argue a lot to make them actually come to our room for inspection. Even though hotel saw my bites they didn’t take it serious and told us they have to check and it turns out there are lots of bed bugs. They also didn’t treat out cloth properly and lots of cloths are ruined. Also when we moved to new room, they didn’t follow procedure and bring our suitcase to new room( it has to go to dryer before moving into new room), so we have to change our room again while our luggage went to dry.
The most disappointed part is irresponsibility of their staff. Hotel Manager told us to go to the hospital and he said he will take care of taxi, medicine, and hospital cost. When we came back from the hospital, he disappear and we haven’t got our reimburse yet. Whenever we went to reception to get reimburse hotel staff said their insurance company will reach out to me within 3-4 days but there is no single contact from insurance company after 10days.
Hotel supervisor Joe also told us that they will arrange meeting with their GM (Jim Berkley) as he is only able to make a decision on reimbursement of our medical/transportation and we scheduled the meeting at 12pm. When we arrived at appointment on time, we only hear meeting is canceled after 20mins of waiting.

"Stayed here for our honeymoon and the only reason we enjoyed it was because all we wanted to do was get away and relax. We checked it right after 4 pm. To make everything hassle free I called 3days before to prepay for everything . The morning before we checked in, I filled out 2 authorization forms for the payments. One for the total amount and one for the deposit. That was a waste of time because when we got there, there was issues with our payments. Eventually everything got resolved. But the point of making it hassle free went straight out the window.

Our room package included a celebration romance package which included sparkling wine upon Arrival and breakfast. I asked at the counter to make sure everything was set up correctly ( to have no more issues or delays) and was told that everything is ready for when we get to the room. We were on the north end so it was a good walk to the elevators but that wasn’t a big deal. We got to the room and NOTHING ! I was a bit disappointed because it’s my honeymoon and I at-least wanted to enjoy our small simple getaway. I had to call the front desk and after staying on hold I was told they were looking for someone to deliver it . They finally did and it was beautiful and they included chocolate covered strawberries. So again, atleast that was resolved.

THE ROOMS - nothing fancy about it. It literally was just a basic king bed room with an oceanfront view on the 6th floor. The bathroom was basic, with a small tv, a mini mini fridge, a chair and a computer desk. Honestly not what we expected but it had to do. No balcony but very clean. We wanted to just relax so it got the job done.

AMENITIES - didn’t explore all of them but the pool, gym and business center is quite lovely.

VALET WAS ALSO AMAZING. Be prepared to pay whether you take the valet option or the self parking option. Only about a $7 difference so might as well do the valet.

BREAKFAST WAS COMPLIMENTARY WITH THE PACKAGE WE CHOSE AND IT WAS THE GREATEST THING EVERY! The food was truly phenomenal

CHECKOUT- just as annoying and hassling as the check in. This is honestly where they lost some stars along with the constant small mistakes. Our bill had a mysterious $49 charge added on for room service that we did not order. I got to the counter and asked about this and they lady had to go through a huge stack of receipts to see why we got charged. I explained to her that she won’t find a receipt because we did not order room service. The only thing we got was the wine and strawberries which was suppose to be included in the price of the package we chose. She apologized and explained that she still had to go through every single receipt to make sure. ANNOYING . This took about 10 mins before she got to the end of the stack and said sorry we humans make mistakes. NO! How many people has left this hotel with charges they were not responsible for?? My advice is please please look over and understand your bill before leaving.",ChNDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVa0NZEAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hilton+Daytona+Beach+Oceanfront+Resort/@32.3925389,-86.2624499,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88e6da15b9f63f63:0x7f69da011a21aa8b!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d29.2302161!4d-81.0094812!16s%2Fg%2F113j35m45?hl=en",ChIJYz_2uRXa5ogRi6ohGgHaaX8,Hotel,3.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNID3IQkVyC7ozLp5WHSWfZ_HEC--bYKnUlqLUj=w150-h150-k-no-p
"Where do I begin?!
On their website they have certain fees placed where if you aren’t looking hard you won’t see them.
$17 to park in an across the street parking lot that does not have a gate to get in or keep people out. The machine doesn’t work so you can’t even put a slip in your car to let people know you have paid.
$24 to have someone park your car for you! In a parking deck with all the security you could ask for!
$50 security fee PER NIGHT you stay.
You have to pay for WiFi here as well. Almost $10 PER DAY!
Resort fees and other “fees” they don’t address.
$24 for breakfast.
Now do not even get me started on their rooms! NOTHING WAS CLEAN! You can slide your finger across the wall and have nothing but dust off. You can see the dust on the bedsheets and lamp shades. If you have allergies do NOT STAY HERE.
The shower handle literally fell off when trying to turn the shower on!
The toilet seat was peeling and cracked.
The carpet was pulled up at spots.
Furniture had stains and scratches on it
(I’m guess from pets since they are a pet friendly hotel)
If you want an actually balcony not a fake one of course that’s even more money!
No microwave or fridge either so don’t take those leftovers back to the hotel with you.
This is the WORST place I have ever stayed! We spent almost $500! You’d expect for $500 the WiFi would be free!
I have stayed at hotels there are $50 a night that are better than this.

"I had accidentally planned to celebrate my daughter's 13th birthday the weekend of labor day. This incurred my costs of the hotel room to be much higher than normal, even though I booked it more than 2 weeks in advance. That aside, we were told there was $17 self-park or $24 valet. There was no self-park that weekend allowed at all. My older daughter arrived separate as a surprise to her sister. She valeted as well to my room. We were able to check in early at 11am.  I reserved a disabled room, as I'm disabled and unable to walk well or too far comfortably. The room we were given was the furthest room in the North Tower away from everything. Due to the fact that the hotel was completely booked, I did not complain,  however,  my original reservations were completely ignored and to do anything in this resort, it felt as if I had to walk 2 football fields to go anywhere. This feat I was incapable of. So, I spent over $200 on room service. Then there was a fiasco with not being able to find my daughter's car. The hotel worked that situation out to my satisfaction.  My original room was supposed to have a mini-fridge in it and a microwave. It had neither of these amenities.  The dinner I ordered for room service was botched,  too. I had called hours ahead to have a birthday cake added to our meal. The first trip, part of the meal was forgotten and so was the cake.

"By far the worst experience I have ever had at a Hilton Bar (Don Rico’s). The female bar tender took our drinks and served them. My girlfriends was delicious and mine was a tequila, grand marnier, Oj, lime juice and soda. I got tequila and sour mix. When we looked at the ticket it was a different drink rang up. Ok no problem mistakes happen. When we told her, she said I made the right drink and just don’t have the button. Then we realized the drink she rang up was more expensive. I’m not worried about money but the drink was wrong and she wants to charge more for it. We brought up that there was no oj and it was made with sour mix and she goes I was out of oj sorry with an attitude. I said well you should have told me that first and I could have picked a different drink. She snaps back and tells us to leave. We are the most understanding people and if they were busy or had a bad day then that happens but she came sideways from the start for no reason.

"Tops as far as getting a clean place to stay with the best view. You will easily spend more on food alone than for the room. For my taste I expected a little more modern room. The odd pastel yellow & brown wall paper seemed kinda 70s to me. We booked an Oceanfront room with a balcony, however the so called balcony is just 6 inches from sliding glass door to railing. But other than decor, it was just like any other bargain hotel as far as mattress and furniture. I kinda expected more from Hilton. Very little water pressure in the shower head. The 5th floor roof top pool is really small and during the day is an oven due to high walls surrounding it blocking any expected rooftop breeze. The D-Dawgs kids area was very cool for the kids providing foozeball table, air hockey table, board games, video games, and the giant Connect Four game. There are also crafts the kids can build & decorate for a couple dollars each. The main pool is where most people hang out. There is a lot of seating and tables. Pool towels are provided and constantly being resupplied. There is a hot tub tucked away in a semi private corner. During my stay it seemed to be where teens were sneaking away to. Every single staff member I came in to contact with were really friendly and helpful. Service was definitely what I expected with a name like Hilton. The location was absolutely beautiful with an incredible view. At night the location had its shortcomings though.

"Let's start from the beginning. For parking I would suggest parking yourself instead of Valet, since it isnt that far. (Literally across the street) Reception was wonderful. They check you in and inform you of the luxuries and incentives, and give you your key card for your room. This keycard is needed for the elevator AND your room. It might seem cumbersome but it is for your safety and security. Also since you can't go any higher than your keycard allows, you dont have to worry about others idlly loitering on floor they do not belong. Room service was wonderful. None of my items were stolen, not even cash. I should also mention the floor through out the room levels of thw hotel, it is extremely soft, almost as if you were walking on pillows. Now, to the showers. There is no tub, which is nice for sanitation purposes, and it has two heads, with there own individual knobs. One is a handheld and the other is mounted. There was also a patio door, tv and nice soft bed, freshly as much as you please. The hotel it self has much to offer. Fedex, starbuck, breakfast lunch and dinner. For business personnel it even has mac and windows computers available for hotel guest use. They also has an extravagant restaurant inside call ""Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse"". They waiters and waitresses are taught proper etiquette and it is magnificent. It may seem pricy but it is well worth it. They have a wide selection of wine, liquor and beer, whatever you please. Also, food from filet mignon to a regular burger, which I was told is amazing. I purchased the Salmon Caesar with a carribean cocktail. The salmon couldn't have been any better, as well as for the salad. They were both made just right. It was amazing. The food the hotel, and the view and access to the beach was nice. One thing I will warn you about for the beach is TO BRING YOUR OWN CHAIRS! The beach chairs that are there already are for rentals only, and they will wait until you look comfortable to ask you if you want to rent it. If you say no, you have to get up, and they take away the chair.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnaS1fS2NnEAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hilton+Daytona+Beach+Oceanfront+Resort/@32.3925389,-86.2624499,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88e6da15b9f63f63:0x7f69da011a21aa8b!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d29.2302161!4d-81.0094812!16s%2Fg%2F113j35m45?hl=en",ChIJYz_2uRXa5ogRi6ohGgHaaX8,Hotel,5.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOenwTMHjhFROO-eulcxex0fXKmiBGIttt_zcwN=w150-h150-k-no-p

The bar was recently redone.  There were many restaurants to accommodate almost any budget.  There is a high end steak house, an American grill, and a Mexican restaurant.  We ate at the Mexican restaurant and it was fantastic!
There is also a market like at a Grand Vacation place with sandwiches and coffee.  There is a kids area on fifth floor of the north tower with games and a person to monitor them.

"One of the worst hotels i have ever stayed at. Not only was our room dirty and i mean dusty and dirty. Our other room we got for the kids that was next to ours has a rusty nail sticking out of the carpet which my son stepped on and went thru his foot, there is dried blood on our bathroom wall above mirror and beside it, our bed was broken in the middle and i have to admit one of the worst night sleeps of my life, roaches in both bathrooms, the toilet sounds like its going to explode when you flush it, and then i wake up to my card being charged an additional $120 when i go up to front desk the supervisor first tells me the extra charges are for valet and taxes, when i inform him i did not use valet that i did self parking for $20 he then changes it to oh it was for the resort fee and taxes so i pull up my receipt for my reservation to show the resort fee and taxes were already included in my booking. Now there are no explanations to why my card has been charged so much. Make matters worse while upfront at the desk another couple comes to speak to manager for finding drugs and needle in their room and had pictures of what they found.

"This is one of the best hotels in Daytona by far. In fact the only two places that I will stay at the Hilton or at the Shores hotel. One of the things that makes the Hilton so nice is that they have recently renovated the property and it has a clean and beachy feel as old as you walk in. Ciara at the front desk if super awesome and friendly. One of the best things about the hotel is the location. It is located right next to the boardwalk so you can walk over and play video games and do a little budget shopping as well and go to the movie or go get ice cream. There are also several different vendors doors as well as a movie theater. Joe’s crabshack as well as bubblegum are both walking distance in addition to marble ice cream company. The hotel also have a Starbucks inside as well as a nice steakhouse called Hyde Park which is fancy and serves premium steaks,chops and cocktails. There is also another restaurant on site that serves breakfast lunch and dinner. It’s nice that once you park your car you don’t have to take it out until you’re ready to leave the hotel.

"Would you like a side of dirty diaper with your Covid? Just some of the many reasons I will no longer stay at a Hilton.

1. When we checked in and got into our hotel room there were two diapers on the floor. One was used and the other was not. The pic shows the unused one. I found the used one behind the curtain. So much for Hilton and their 9 page write up on their commitment to cleanliness.

2. Half the people in the lobby and throughout the hotel were mask-less even though there is a mandatory requirement for the hotel. No enforcement at all, especially for the elevator where we were sharing with people who were blatantly disregarding the rules. We ended up using the stairs.

3. Speaking of the stairs. It seemed to be the place to go to smoke pot. I don't really care that people do this but I wondered if my son was getting a contact buzz as we walked up and down. Still better than covid.

4. In the middle of the night a domestic violence situation blew up so badly i almost called the cops. A man and woman were screaming f bombs at each other and banging on the walls and doors after locking each other out. My son asked if we were safe...

In the end, I expect these sort of things at motels. I have stayed in my fair share of them growing up. I don't expect this from a Hilton and it was too much to ever trust them again.
