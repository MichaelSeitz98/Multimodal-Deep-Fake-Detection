"Our hotel room was rather disgusting.  The carpet is full of stains and the wallpaper is pealing off of the wall in the bathroom.  As you will see in one of my pictures they have a holder in the bathtub for decent size bottles of shampoo, conditioner and soap.  The holder locks which I assume is so that nobody can steal their products.  However, the soap wasn't in the locked container.  I guess that is so that their guests can carry that soap back and forth between the shower and the sink because that was the only soap in the room.  Also, the large bottle for conditioner was completely empty.  It seemed more like a $59.99 room instead of a $159 room.  Very disappointing.

The buffet is OK but expensive and so is the little sandwich shop on the bottom floor"

"We went on a Monday night to celebrate a 21st birthday. We ate at 99 Hops House. All the dishes were really good, I had the chicken panini and it was full of flavor and really delicious.

The service was great, they even brought a happy birthday slice of cheese cake to the guest of honor, we did not order or ask for this, it was a kind gesture from the establishment.

"Hotel rooms are not great. They have not been updated since the early 1900s.

I had to stick a folded up card behind the door lock to make it latch properly. I was worried about a fire in the old building. I made sure I knew where the fire escapes were.

"I was very disappointed.  My stay lasted no more than 20 minutes.

When I arrived, the Clerk was disinterested.  I was told to park in the ""school"" parking lot.  What I was NOT told was that someone needed to be there to unlock the gate.  When I pulled up, the lot was locked.  I had to drive around the block to get back into the hotel, to inform the Clerk it was locked, for one of the bellboys to say someone needed to meet me out there to unlock the fence.  I then drove around the block again and was able to get into the parking lot.

Upon entering my hotel room, I was in disbelief.  I understand this is a historic building, but was surprised to find that to them, historic meant outdated, dingy, dirty, and simply un-maintained.

I rented a 2 bedroom suite.  The kitchen was in a room off of 1 bedroom, while the bathroom was in the other bedroom.  So, to use the restroom, you had to enter the other guest's room.

The fridge didn't shut unless you slammed it.  I understand now why their website has minimal photos of their rooms.

There is no AC or central air.  The wall heaters were on when I arrived.  I turned them all off.  To cool my room, I opened the windows.  I was on the 4th floor and had no screen on my large windows.   A loose nail was just sitting on my window ledge.  I called down to the front desk and had them bring up 2 fans, which I put in my windows to attempt some form of cool air in my suite.

There were dead flies and bees on the floor, on the heating units, and in the windowsills.  A live grasshopper was on my bed.  Again.  I was on the 4th floor.

The bed in the room with the TV was broken.  When my guest sat on it, I truly thought she was going to flip off the bed as it sank so far down, so quickly.

After maybe 20 minutes total, I could no longer justify the extreme expense of my room ($630 for two nights).  When I went down to the Clerk, I asked for a manager, and she came up quickly.  I briefly explained my concerns and without hesitation, she said she would cancel my room.  While I was pleased with this resolution, it seemed odd that the immediate response was simply to remove me from the hotel rather than find a more acceptable room.  This leads me to believe this is a common occurrence.

My stay lasted no more than 20 minutes.

When I arrived, the Clerk was disinterested.  I was told to park in the ""school"" parking lot.  What I was NOT told was that someone needed to be there to unlock the gate.  When I pulled up, the lot was locked.  I had to drive around the block to get back into the hotel, to inform the Clerk it was locked, for one of the bellboys to say someone needed to meet me out there to unlock the fence.  I then drove around the block again and was able to get into the parking lot.

Upon entering my hotel room, I was in disbelief.  I understand this is a historic building, but was surprised to find that to them, historic meant outdated, dingy, dirty, and simply un-maintained.

Looks like a well maintained‚Äã golf course. It has a nice clubhouse and OK RV park for peaple traveling. I'm not a golfer but I stayed at the RV park.  I saw how well they kept up the golf course.  I stayed in the RV park for two months.  They did not seem good at managing the RV park and at times the management didn't know who was even there.  At times they didn't even dump the trash cans. They sometimes went days without doing this and only dumped them oafter they started overflowing. The golf course was well kept but there was lots of weeds around the RV spaces.  Electrical is included but daily space rates seem high for what they have to offer. This was NOT a dog friendly RV park. They have very poor WiFi service.

"Fun skatepark, fun spot for the kiddos to play. Wish I had access to all these facilities as a kid. Park is slick for sure but skatelite is slick. So no shock there.

"We love Nickelodeon Universe!!!! They've got rides for toddlers, big kids and adults; face painting, caricatures, airbrush shirts. I've taken my kids multiple times and we all love it.

There may be long lines for some rides but they move pretty fast. Most popular rides may have 30-40 minute wait times. There are places to sit and restrooms sprinkled throughout Nick Universe so you dont have to roam through the mall to find relief. Less crowded in the evenings after dinnertime.

Always a great time at Nickelodeon. So many different rides to choose from. I suggest so on a weekday cause weekends are always jam packed. They have Toddler Tuesdays and special deals with that.

"The hotel was fine, looked nice on the surface but definitely not maintained at all. Our room had a busted divider frame in the seating area as well as a broken closet door mirror. I let the front desk know about it immediately apon us checking into our room, they said they would let maintenance know right away... we stayed 4 days and it was never addressed. The other negative part was the pool, my daughter was only able to swim once due to the extremely over chlorinated water. It was hard to sit in there it was so bad.

Our room had a busted divider frame in the seating area as well as a broken closet door mirror. I let the front desk know about it immediately apon us checking into our room, they said they would let maintenance know right away... we stayed 4 days and it was never addressed. The other negative part was the pool, my daughter was only able to swim once due to the extremely over chlorinated water. It was hard to sit in there it was so bad. Her eyes burned for days after swimming in there.

The staff was friendly. The room was clean, it is just sadly starting to get run down from what I can tell."

"I finally got a chance to check this place out. Most of the barcades are in Charlotte so it's nice to have one close to home. I went on a Thursday night which is ""guys night"" and was welcomed as soon as I walked in, both the owners and the guests were very friendly. For Thursdays, about all games were free (at least for dudes) except for pinball, which were .50 a game. Normally it's $5 a person for unlimited play and pinball is $1.00 a game (ouch to $1.00 pinball!). There were maybe 6 to 12 people rotating in and out while I was there, so not crowded at all. Parking was abundant. It's about a 5 minute walk from Freeman's. Bar can turn cash to quarters or can give you quarters from your bar tab for a 10% surcharge. Bar had food and drinks at fair prices. There are 2 gender neutral restrooms. There are a few TV's playing sports and comic book movies and YouTube videos. Place was open until midnight on a weeknight which was cool. There was one tv hooked up to a Nintendo 64 with a pretty large assortment of games. There were a couple party/board games sitting near a table. There was a fairly large area for outdoor seating as well. I think what made this visit special was how friendly the owners and guests were, felt like you were just visiting old friends instead of strangers.

EDIT: Citycade did a reconfiguration and brought in a racing game, a shooting game, a beer pong game and a couple of pay to win games disguised as games of skill. I believe at this point they've gotten rid of the $5 cover entirely and just made the machines take quarters, which I think was a good move. Pinball is still a buck which is a bummer since there are better options out there for $.50 a game, but it's close to home at least and the price point isn't uncommon. Pinball seems maintained and Citycade has occasionally swapped out for different pins, which is nice. Bathrooms are always clean which is a plus.

Great fun for the family. If you're local you'll want a membership for planetarium discounts. They change up the sky shows every so often. This last show we went to in April was actually boring and I fell asleep but they did the Carolina sky afterwards and it was Great! They actual museum is just the right size. They have manual wheelchairs but my mother didn't feel she needed one she used her walker and it was ok. Although we didn't travel all over it was a good little tour of the facility.

"This was such a cool place to learn about so many different things. Local history, habitats, and animals beginning in the Prehistoric Era. Informative and well maintained exhibits.

There is also a small farm that you can enjoy with live animals. The cost to enter is $3/pp but we ran out of time today.

"SUPERB AUTHENTIC THAI in the Pittsburgh area, a short 15 min drive from downtown.  Cozy restaurant with no-touch menu, short and sweet. It looks a popular spot to locals of many persuasions. Takeout or sit in (I have done both), it‚Äôs simply excellent food. A FOODIE‚ÄôS GEM.

Start with Fresh Rolls and Fried Eggplant, contrasting but complementary textures and sweet tangy sauces that wake up the palate (very much unlike the cliche peanut sauce in the run of mill Thai-style places.

Any of the curry entrees are very good, smooth well-balanced sauces; none of that pungent sugar-loaded curry so common in so-called Thai restaurants in this town.

My recommendation: Duck Curry, very crispy well seasoned perfectly cooked duck atop the smooth Red curry with bell peppers and cherry tomatoes, carefully balanced with two halves of lychee just enough to brighten the palate: Simply Wow!

Pair the curry with any of the Thai stir fry veggies.  I‚Äôm partial to the Hot Basil fry, extra veggies (natural sweetness of the fresh vegetables complemented with their brown sauce).

By the way, enjoy Thai food with a spoon rather than fork/knife. Spoon the curry or veggies on rice, mix, then enjoy. Spoon allows one to taste every drop of the sauce.

Cozy restaurant with no-touch menu, short and sweet. It looks a popular spot to locals of many persuasions. Takeout or sit in (I have done both), it‚Äôs simply excellent food. A FOODIE‚ÄôS GEM.

Start with Fresh Rolls and Fried Eggplant, contrasting but complementary textures and sweet tangy sauces that wake up the palate (very much unlike the cliche peanut sauce in the run of mill Thai-style places.

Any of the curry entrees are very good, smooth well-balanced sauces; none of that pungent sugar-loaded curry so common in so-called Thai restaurants in this town.

"I live directly up the street from this place on Washington Ave and I have got to say that I am absolutely disappointed with their quality of food.  Today, I just recently ordered their Pad Kee Mao and it looked like someone chewed up the meal and spit it right back out into the carry out tray.  The noodles were overly soggy and mushed up like mashed potatoes.  The salad that comes with the Lunch looks as if someone cut out a large chunk from a piece of lettuce, threw it into the tray, and then decided to splash a little sauce on top of it.

I don't normally complain about food and most times I simply ignore the mistakes but I've been living in Bellevue for 3 years now and this incident has happened more than once.  A customer can only be patient so many times and then there comes a point where a enough is enough.  This restaurant will never receive my services ever again.  I don't know if it's the cook or the management but the quality of food is poor.  Years ago the food was much better. I'm not sure what happened between then and now.

If you want a quality restaurant for Thai food, go to Niky's Thai Kitchen.  I promise you, Niky's Thai Kitchen is the better choice.  Their food quality is suburb compared to Thai Tamarind, especially for the price you'll pay for it.

"Well, it wasn't anywhere NEAR as good as a few years back but the presentation was decent. Of course the prices went up, lol. An almost 3 star. Almost. Sadly I can NOT recommend  Thai Tamarind any longer since the flavors were incredibly weak and/or bland; so much tasted like it came from a jar and the top of the line ""thai spicy"" was a powder they sprinkled on top of every dish when presenting your level of spicy. Some of the powder hadn't fully dissolved during your meal so you would gets little clumps of it in your mouth. The ""so-called"" Thai Iced Tea I had tasted as if it were a syrup from a bottle. Yech!

Pictured you have the Tom Yum soup, Volcano Chicken and the Thai Style Chicken Noodle. All bland and weak. Not pictured but as an appetizer we had the chicken satay, another huge let down since when eaten with a homemade peanut sauce or cucumber sauce, it is DELICIOUS! The peanut sauce seems to have some type of dairy added to it. Gross.

Newly renovated lobby and rooms.  Love the new layout and renovations.  The rooms are modern and clean.  The floors are laminate so very different from the carpeted floors they had before.

"Would leave a higher rating if it wasn't a 4 star hotel. My room looked out to the rooftop and a tall white wall around its perimeter.

"I've stayed at a lot of Marriotts because of business trips in the past 10 years. They usually don't fall below a certain standard, but it seems in this case they did.

The rooms were pricey and we had booked a room with 2 queen beds and they gave us a room with a king and a sofa bed. Now you might think of this as an upgrade if you had a couple booking the room, but this was for 3 people and getting a sofa bed when you have paid for a queen. When i mentioned this in the app, they said they would fix it the next day and they did, and they have us the room right next to ours which made for a very easy transfer through the connecting door, which is what raised my review from 1 star to 2.

I suspect they changed our booking because they were having a convention and needed the room but this isn't an acceptable reason.

Other things that bothered me were the cleanliness of the rooms. I attached a couple of photos showing what our floor was like in the first room and the dirt inside the coffee maker. In both rooms, the coffee makers were terrible with one even having hair in it.

Finally it saddens me to see a sad attempt to look progressive with 3 places to charge an electric car. 2 Tesla spots of which 1 was it of order and 1 for non Tesla electric cars.

If you want to add electric car charging to your hotel add 10 spots not have a token amount and not even functional

I think they rely on the event housing so much they don't really care about their amenities is status of their rooms so much. Because every night we were there they had all least 2 events going on.

For the price and the quality, might as well just stay in mystic close to everything.

"I had high expectations for this property based on its category and price range. It did not deliver in accordance to its value and how it was advertised. The room I was initially given was not properly cleaned. There were clear signs that the fitted sheet was not laundered. I had to switch rooms, which unfortunately was a downgrade, and there were cleanliness issues in that room as well. The room amenities were lacking, which again is surprising based on category and price. The spa was closed, as well as the hot tub. Those items played a big role in my decision, so I was quite disappointed to find out they were closed. Why didn't the price and category reflect these changes. They are being very misleading, and that's enough to turn me away from Marriott properties. My main concern is they are still advertising as if they have everything together during these times and are charging inflated prices. I am highly upset I did not receive what was expected and now feel like my money put into this property is a major loss. The only thing that was nice is the customer service of the front office staff. The lady taking our breakfast room service order was a little off putting. There was a mistake made with my order. I called to let her know but she seemed upset at me for letting her know their mistake. It was corrected, but her tone was unsettling. The toast was overcooked and stale.

"I love the Peppermill. They have great food with surprising variety at low prices. I had the inside out grilled cheese. It has baby Swiss, cheddar, tomato, red onion, and avocado on parmesan crusted bread. It was amazing. The onion was flavorful and the creamy avocado made the two melted cheeses even better. The parmesan added another layer of crispness to each bite. I upgraded to tater tots instead of chips, and I was surprised at the large portion. My daughter had a pancake and tots.

They have great food with surprising variety at low prices. I had the inside out grilled cheese. It has baby Swiss, cheddar, tomato, red onion, and avocado on parmesan crusted bread. It was amazing. The onion was flavorful and the creamy avocado made the two melted cheeses even better. The parmesan added another layer of crispness to each bite. I upgraded to tater tots instead of chips, and I was surprised at the large portion. My daughter had a pancake and tots.

Prices were not as high as expected for how huge and nice the facility is. Of course trampoline parks are pricey regardless but I thought it was worth the money. Will be back.
Side note: I‚Äôve been to several other trampoline parks and they play the best music at Hive by far."

Really nice everything brand new really big but long-term price won‚Äôt work. We definitely will be going to the other trampoline places then to come here because of the prices. Arcade is over priced for what you can win. Which is like that almost everywhere. I do love that they have so many couches and lots of areas for the parents to sit and watch kids. Oh and you have to have non-grip socks and they don‚Äôt tell you that when you come in and they do not have prices for the Sox listed on their board either. They are three dollars a pair of socks and they don‚Äôt have any deals on them like if you buy multiple or a pack or anything to save money which is kind of crazy because if I knew beforehand I could‚Äôve bought some online for way cheaper from somewhere else. I like that you have to wear a electronic wristband that has a green and red light to tell you when your time is up. Everything is very Clean because it is a brand new building and equipment.

"Great place, definitely glad to have it near us. Yes it costs more than Hang Time, but it has more to offer. Plus a bunch of couches and several massage chairs for adults.
At Hang Time I'm always worried about where my smaller kids are because you can't keep a good eye everywhere. Feels like it's for older kids and young adults with more trampolines for tricks.

What I like about The Hive it's good for kids of all ages. There's a tetherball with jumping around it. Two interactive video game screens that actually show their picture on screen as they jump, so fun!
Zip line, jumping basketball, targets, go carts (costs extra), the biggest bounce house/obstacle course I've ever seen. Regular trampolines too, rock wall, ninja warrior obstacles, slack line.

There are drinking fountains, but they're by the go carts (kind of annoying they're so far).
They also have bands to wear that have lights that change color when your time is up. They do have lockers as well.
Overall, we'll go again, but less frequently because of the cost.

We were getting tired and decided to stop here for the night.  We have been visiting this place off and on for many years but had not ever spent the night.  We were surprised at how reasonable the prices were and the rooms were clean and actually stylish.  Made it feel like a small apartment.  Seem to be fairly well sound insulated as I did not hear much nose which made for a good night's sleep.  The little store has beer which rocked after a long day of driving!!

"Nicest roach motel I've stayed at.  It looks cute and quaint from a distance, but don't be fooled into booking a room there.  AC was not adequate.  Had to leave the sliding patio door open for air, which was really hard to move because it was off its rollers.  It was also not secure because the patio is shared with every room on that side of the building.  The room was not clean.  There was trash left from the previous occupant: receipt in the dresser, pizza crust under the bed, comb on the bathroom sink, and water in the ice bucket.  There was a brown crusty substance on the edge of the bathroom garbage can.  The bed sheets were too short and because I'm tall my feet were rubbing on the rough protective pad underneath.  Both beds were like that but I was the only one tall enough to notice.  The map of the grounds they gave us was a bad copy and it was hard to read the amenities.

It looks cute and quaint from a distance, but don't be fooled into booking a room there.  AC was not adequate.  Had to leave the sliding patio door open for air, which was really hard to move because it was off its rollers.  It was also not secure because the patio is shared with every room on that side of the building.  The room was not clean.  There was trash left from the previous occupant: receipt in the dresser, pizza crust under the bed, comb on the bathroom sink, and water in the ice bucket.  There was a brown crusty substance on the edge of the bathroom garbage can.  The bed sheets were too short and because I'm tall my feet were rubbing on the rough protective pad underneath.  Both beds were like that but I was the only one tall enough to notice.  The map of the grounds they gave us was a bad copy and it was hard to read the amenities.  I thought there might be a nicer version in the amenities book in the room but the book had nothing in it at all.  This means we knew nothing about the hotel other than what was on the bad map.  We didn't have any phone numbers to call for service or if it was possible to order food from the restaurant.

"We LOVE western Wyoming's Little America! This was the first Little America we ever visited (over two years ago) and it is our favorite by far! (Little America Flagstaff is a close second.) We've never stayed at the hotel, but the travel center is excellent!

The shower rooms are always spotless and so cozy, each having its own huge, glass-doored, tile shower, and a separate soaking tub as an added bonus that we always look forward to. Showers are $12, and they provide mineral bath gel, bars of soap, and plenty of clean, warm towels. We stop solely for the amazing showers, but stick around a little longer for the food.

The grill has exceeded our expectations as far as a travel center food stop goes - the menu is kinda limited, but they have several different choices, from burgers to breakfast to fried chicken. The food is made to order and everything we've had has been so delicious. (My personal favorite is the breakfast burrito with sausage gravy.) The grill is also open 24 hours a day and serving everything on the menu all day long. Sure beats a basic fast food stop at any of the other travel centers!

In our experience, the staff at this location have been very friendly, welcoming, and happy to meet whatever need that arises, round the clock. If you're a trucker, get here early (or super late night) if you hope to find a parking spot. This is the last travel stop for a while if you're eastbound, and the veteran drivers already know how awesome this place is, so the lot fills up quick and there's usually a ton of create-a-spot tetris going on come nightfall.

The Little America experience is never short of amazing for us, and so memorable that every time we leave we can hardly wait until our next visit! Plus, they have a great view from the parking lot.

"Hotel is extremely outdated and staff needs to brush up on their customer service skills. The property probably hasn't had any sort of renovation since the 90's and it is long overdue. I was offered a package when I checked in which included a discount if I spent $30 in the gift shop/restaurant/gas station. I was told to bring back my receipts and they would apply the discount. The next morning I went into the front desk with my receipts only to be told I needed to turn them in the night before. I told the front desk attendant that I was not informed that it had to be turned in the same day I checked in, only to bring my receipts back and the front desk lady would take off the discount.  The front desk attendant rudely said,  ""yeah her and she's not here"". I then asked for a manager who quickly resolved the problem. If you're going to have a strict policy on how long customers have to turn in receipts for credits on a package I didn't even ask for then you need to inform the customers of that policy.

"Myself and 5 friends went tonight to celebrate our good friend's engagement and wedding coming up next month with something a little different! We had an amazing time, the food was totally different than what we normally would find but so good, we had a ton of fun picking out our meals, trying all the different things, and just enjoying the experience. The wait staff was phenomenal, I honestly think Allison was a highlight of our evening. She was very personable, made us feel entirely comfortable, and had great tips and information on the menu.

We were gifted with extras at dessert, champagne for those of us that partook in cocktails and N/A sparkling juice for those that didn't and it was SO good! Super refreshing! We also (seriously, they were so amazing) were gifted a bite of something delicious - I apologize for not remembering what it was by the pastry chef this evening - but it had almonds, was a dessert bar of some sort and it was really good - not super sweet, honestly would have gone great with coffee if any of us had room for it - which we most certainly did not.

The atmosphere was wonderful, even being in proximity to other tables it still felt intimate enough that we couldn't hear other parties' conversations, nor could they hear ours, and I feel like we were a little rambunctious at times. Also, my friends that had cocktails said nothing but high praise for them - my coke with lime was also top notch * in case anyone cared ;)

Food. That's why you're reading this, yeah?
It was good. Like, really great. It also felt like a performance at times. Lots of fun pouring, super attentive taking items away, never once had to ask for anything, be it water, napkin, silverware, etc etc. Maybe we're cheap dates but I'm fairly certain everyone went above and beyond, exceeding our expectations. Thanks for a great experience!

In case my photo captions don't save:
1. Scallops
2. Surprise Carrot & Cardamom Soup option (big fan of this, you don't know unless you KNOW)
3. Beef Medallion Filet - my favorite of the 3 savory dishes
4. The best dang dessert option there is - even though the mousse looked and sounded amazing - I will DIE on this chocolatey-citrus hill any day. Any. Day.

"Our wedding at Lake Park Bistro was absolutely perfect. We had a tented reception with cocktail hour on the gorgeous East Balcony with stunning views of Lake Michigan. The restaurant's white pillars were a perfect location for photos and the surrounding park offered more beautiful options all with in a walking distance. The staff was fantastic and our guests were thrilled with their prompt and friendly service. We also received many, many compliments on the food from our family and friends; even those ‚Äòhard to impress‚Äô said their meal at Lake Park Bistro was the best they‚Äôd ever had at a wedding. However, the best thing about Lake Park Bistro was working with Dan. He made us feel comfortable and welcome every step of the way and provided us with excellent advice to make our day fun and stress-free. Dan was clear in all of our communications and went above and beyond to host a meeting for myself and my other vendors. His honest feedback and recommendations helped make our day personal, special, and truly, the best day of our lives. We truly can not say enough about our wonderful experience at Lake Park Bistro, thank you Dan and team!!

It's difficult to deal with customer service when there are issues; they are very dismissive.

"It's been a few years since we have stayed here and unfortunately will probably be the last time. I received an email inviting me to stay there which stated they had newly remodeled rooms, which made us want to go ahead and book here instead of our usual other option. Well, our visit was less than satisfying. We drove up Sunday afternoon to check in and were told there was no valet service - park across the street, and walk back to check in (was not allowed to keep my car in their driveway while checking in). Not a good start. Check in line had about 10 parties waiting to check in and only two front desk folks (after about 10 minutes one more front desk agent showed up). Once in the room, I was confused how they could state the rooms were remodeled(?). Bathroom was great (only one hook to hang towels), the room was painted, but the furniture was still old and scratched up, the chair was creaking with every move and the thermostat was very dirty (not huge, but very noticeable). The casino had no live tables, so we had to go somewhere else to play - I prefer to just stay in my hotel to gamble. As far as the 'Resort Fee', it lists 2 water bottles (helpful on a 100 degree day), but never got that - I called down to see if they could be brought over and never got them. There were a couple of coffee pods with a sign stating they will be refreshed every morning, they are not. I called the 2nd morning to get a couple, but ended up running to Starbucks instead (Why are they charging a resort fee???). If this covers the parking, maybe think about charging the people parking in your lot and not staying at your hotel.
In any case, with all the alternative hotels in Reno I will not be booking another room at Circus Circus. I'll keep the old memories of what they used to be years ago.

"Our experience here was awesome! My boyfriend and I did 'The Lost Ship' room. It was a Wednesday 7pm booking, so just the two of us took on the challenge without anyone else booking in. And we escaped with 90 seconds to spare!! Our guide, Captain Charles, did a fantastic job introducing the room to us with this whole back story to set us up. If you pay close attention, there are clues in everything he's saying as well.

The room itself was the best part. It was actually several rooms all joined together and from the lobby you had to figure out how to even enter the main room in the first place‚Äîsuper cool! I had never seen anything like that before. The puzzles were also really well thought out and interesting, using logic and problem solving (not at all abstract or random). Of all the escape rooms I have done, I would say that this has been the best experience I have had because of the attention to detail in the room, the quality of the puzzles, and the experience of being able to solve it with just the two of us.

The room is actually designed for at least 6 people, because it would have been helpful for others to take on and simultaneously solve riddles in the room. I'm pretty amazed we were able to do it with just 2 (but it was mostly because we had a few timely hints... big ones, lol). Awesome experience, highly recommend!!!

A great little gem in Buffalo! A very challenging course for all abilities. Greens were fast and in great shape. Fairways were clean and rolled true. Great customer service. Very nice restaurant attached to the clubhouse. The cart girl was very happy every time we saw her and that's tough when it's that hot out. Overall five star quality.

Always a fun course and always in great shape! The crew does a nice job keeping the greens consistently quick along with plush fairways and fair rough. The views are an extra bonus!

"Check your expectations. This is a rescue zoo, not a full-fledged corporate-sponsored zoo like the big ones. They have a great variety for being a small sanctuary. The paths are dirt and gravel, so wear close-toed shoes. If you or someone you are with is in a wheelchair, it may be a little rough, but we saw a few people in standard and motorized chairs. There are about 50 peacocks free roaming and in habitats. Also, it is the spring, so expect some frisky animals. The big cats can spray you if you get too close or they think you are a threat. There is a train that is about $5/rider. It is a nice little ride around the back of some of the paddocks. Every single staff member was super friendly and helpful and knowledgable. Though they don‚Äôt have concessions, they do have vending machines throughout the park. There are a few regular bathrooms that are wheelchair accessible. There are also quite a few portable toilets to the right of the entrance. The wolves, cougars, lions, and tiger were all big draws. The bears were not out when we went.

"I hardly ever leave bad reviews but compared to San Antonio zoo this place was such a let down. Most of the animals are all caged up so you can‚Äôt really see them.

"This place is amazing.  Talk about taking yourself back in time for a minute you feel like you are in Germany.  They open at 5pm for dinner only.  You drive down this  dark road, and you would never know there was a parking lot and a restaurant from the top of the road.
You go inside from the parking lot on a top level,  down a flight of  stairs is the restaurant.  They do have an elevator for handicap.
Once below it's amazing.  It's small probably about 30 tables, wooden walls, and all decorated with Germany memorabilia.
I was so excited to try this place the last time I had German food was in Germany 20 plus years ago.  I still remember what that tasted like.
There was 2 waitress serving and taking orders. Lisa was our waitress.  She is such a nice lady,  and definitely knows her menu,  and has worked their for a long time.  I ordered the German beer on tap it was very light, clear, and refreshing. My other half Bayrischer Schweinebraten it was a tender slow roasted pork shoulder.  I tasted the dish and it was amazing.  Very tender and with lots of flavor.  It was not sliced it was more like chunk pork. His side was the sliced apples.  I have never tried apples sliced fresh, in a cinnamon sauce.  I wish you could order this by the pint or quart to take home.  Amazing!
I ordered J√§gerschnitzel which was delicious with the cream white wine sauce, and mushroom.  The sauce was so good I asked for a little more sauce. The pork meat was tender, and a nice slice. My sides was potato pancakes oh my goodness hold the fork these were not greasy at all.  I put the sour cream and applesauce on the potato cakes. My other side I was wanting to try was the German potato salad.  It was good, completely traditional,  but not my favorite for my taste buds. Before dinner you have a choice of soup or salad.  I definitely tried the soup which was really good the traditional red cabbage soup.
I can't wait to come back to try more dishes.
For dessert if you have room definitely order the bread pudding with the warm whiskey sauce.  You will want to make room for this dessert.
We were getting ready to leave, they were closing, and they were so nice they make everything fresh daily, and had extra apple and cherry turnovers. I had taken home 1 of each. The next day with a cup of coffee, warmed up,  very good.
I can't wait to come back!

Talk about taking yourself back in time for a minute you feel like you are in Germany.  They open at 5pm for dinner only.  You drive down this  dark road, and you would never know there was a parking lot and a restaurant from the top of the road.
You go inside from the parking lot on a top level,  down a flight of  stairs is the restaurant.  They do have an elevator for handicap.
Once below it's amazing.  It's small probably about 30 tables, wooden walls, and all decorated with Germany memorabilia.

"This is truly a hidden gem!

They have a dance group anyone can join; it's been very fun! Wednesdays at 7PM, except for the 2nd Wednesday each month.  I have literally no dance background, but this is folk dancing, so that's fine üòÅ

Edelweiss is located in German Park at the end of the drive.  The park itself isn't anything major, but the scenery is very nice.
Once at the parking lot, you can go in the main entrance and down the stairs to the restaurant or follow the sidewalk north of the building where it slopes down and around the building to their outdoor seating. You can see a gnome garden along the way!
I've seen comments saying this place isn't handicap accessible, but this sidewalk is the entrance to take if you have a wheelchair or stroller.  Understandably, this will be inconvenient if it is raining.
The outdoor seating is the beer garden area and the doors lead into the restaurant.

On Wednesdays there is a buffet.  I'm writing this review after a stop at their buffet and I'm impressed.
On Fridays they have live music; simply amazing fun!

They have several events through the year and I definitely recommend checking them out! Fr√ºhlingsfest, J√§gerfest, Octoberfest and more!

Through the year, they have several German events, including an Octoberfest.  From what I hear, it's a blast!

"Fantastic interior layout, private dining area from the bar. My brother and I came here for dinner he was in town and I haven't been here yet so we decided to try it. Food was interesting to say the least, we got the CALABRIAN CHILI CUCUMBERS for an app and it was more tangy like pickled cucumbers. Still very refreshing. I got the SWEET CORN AGNOLOTTI  , charred corn very sweet with shredded crab mix, pretty good however needed a little salt added.
My brother got BRAISED PORK BELLY, cooked an amazin crispy skin , however, this one was overly salted. Not bad but our palette was interesting.
Then we ended with dessert CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE and Seasonal Truffles (3)
By far my favorite I've tried, subtle , flavor isn't overpowering (I don't have that much of a sweet tooth) would definitely get the dessert again! The truffles was alright, dark chocolate and white chocolate. Tasted really nice.

"Elm was lovely! All the staff was so warm, friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was so unique for Bloomington. I felt transported to a metropolitan area‚Ä¶in all the best ways!

Returned to the Casino in November to dine at the restaurant overlooking the dog track. You can dine and watch the races from your comfortable seat and table.

"Update 2/14/23

Walking up to the main entrance of the casino was worse than before.  Cigarettes are all over,  things need painted and everything could do well with a good powerwashing.  Nothing about this 1st glance gives me ""destination resort"" vibes.    We arrived around 8:30 in the morning so it was obvious this littered mess was not fresh.  If this place wants to pull in new customers and become a major moneymaker,  things need to change.  When your facility is much less clean than the local gas stations,  you have an issue.   Granted,  the inside is clean,  but the outside is what sets the tone.  Do better, Mardi Gras!

Original review:  We have stayed here numerous times through the years.  This last visit was already a letdown due to no pool and none of the amazing breakfast foods.  The room was not the cleanest and the gold fixtures are now chrome and gold due to someone using the incorrect cleaner.  All of the restaurants in the casino were closed and there was no room service.

My suggestions to help would be:

Breakfast:  Since the old buffet style won't work,  the easiest way to serve the delicious hot breakfast would be for each room to put an order in either online or by calling concierge.  Their items would be prepared and could be dropped off contactless outside of the room or could be picked up in the lobby.

Cleaning:  Supervisor checking rooms to make sure they are bring cleaned properly.  They should also be sure to teach proper use of cleaning agents and which products to use on each surface.

Restaurants:  If none of the on site eateries are going to be open,  either offer meals via room service again or at least put together a listing of nearby restaurants and contact information.   Maybe even see if any would be willing to give hotel guests a discount.

"Challenging holes are carved out of the hillside along the river at this course to provide something for everyone. First and foremost there is more vertical change at this course than many I have played in the past. Some pin locations are a hundred feet above the tee box while others are the same downhill. This makes it almost a must to rent a cart if you are playing 18, unless you are in peak physical condition.

The clubhouse is big and clean with friendly staff members to help out with your needs. The range is quite short and narrow, only 200 yards max by about 20 yards wide which makes it hard to warm up for the long shots you will need to be successfull right off the first tee. The carts are older and gas powered which made it tricky to get up some if the steep hills and there is some slow play if you are behind the wrong group.

Insider tip: make sure to study the course before you go if you haven't played here. There are hidden creeks and obstacles that ruin great shots down the middle.

The carts are older and gas powered which made it tricky to get up some if the steep hills and there is some slow play if you are behind the wrong group.

Insider tip: make sure to study the course before you go if you haven't played here. There are hidden creeks and obstacles that ruin great shots down the middle. Better yet, play a practice round so you'll be ready before taking it on!"

"Four of us from Honolulu, Hawaii played this course on September 26, 2016 and we absolutely enjoyed the round.  Great staff, course and surroundings.

Wildwood GC provides exceptional value and we put this course on our play again course whenever we're up here in the Portland area. Our foursome consisted of three Waialae Country Club and one Mid-Pacific Country Club members.  Mahalo Bob for taking great care of us.

Returned to play with some other buddies on May 6, 2017 before heading back to Honolulu the next day after a  five day golfing tour in the greater Portland area.  They were impressed Wildwood is on their ""will play again"" list.  Thanks Tom and the rest of the staff for taking care of us and welcoming us back.

"Just played here on Sunday 10/6, about three weeks post-punching. The greens are fantastic. They're rolling very smooth and true..and at a great speed. They're firm, yet they're holding shots the way they should. Also, the traps were all hand raked, and fairways were very playable.

Look for a new expanded green complex and new lower tee on the par three # 6, and new tee locations on # 7. One thing that always impresses me about Wildwood, is the attention to detail, and the constant reinvestment in the course and clubhouse.

Also, the service is always friendly and accommodating. If you've never played Wildwood, be sure to give it a try. It's a real hidden gem of a golf course, with plenty of interesting holes, lots of character and challenges, and spectacular views.

"Really enjoy Wildwood. The course is always in good condition and the prices always seem fair. I play courses that charge more or just as much as Wildwood, but are over crowded and not as pretty.

About half of the holes have an elevated gain at the green or tee box.  It might be a ride for some. If the walk from the first tee box or the walk to the 9th green look steep to you.

"Reserved our deluxe king room with jetted tub for Sept 19th back in mid June 2021 & requested a quiet location (if possible). They put us in room 314, which was located on 3rd of 4 floors, right outside of the elevators & across from the ice machine room (very noisy).

The bath towels were thin, rough, and worn (one had two rips on edges... see pics). Jetted tub was the best part of the room, but took forever to fill up. But, for some stupid reason there was NO vent fan in the bathroom! Horrible!

The furnishings were a bit dated & I wouldn't call the size of the king room a ""deluxe"". Reserved that room purely because I knew after a 12 hr drive I'd want to soak in a nice big bath tub. Mattress was comfy, but only 3 squishy pillows (not 4) on the king sized bed (no neck support at all).

I am appalled at the quality of service and food at this place. While a family of Mexicans sitting next to us got served like royalty we were put on the back burner the waitress came over a total of three times while we were there. She also loved to flirt with her boss the whole time while ignoring us! We ran out of chips and salsa asked for more and didn't get any until after we got our food. When I got my plate. The portion was so small ! I had maybe 10 tiny pieces of meat and 4 pieces of shrimp on my dish which was the muscle maker . The lettuce was all brown and nasty. The avocado looked rotten. And not just a normal oxidation brown but it looked like it had been sitting and got rotten and they didn't care. Also only got like three slices of avocado. The dish looked nothing like the picture on the menu. I would have sent it back immediately but the waitress ran off and never even came back until it was to bring  the check. I didn't eat a bite of it and they tried to charge me for it until we talked to the manager! His excuse was they were training them. Yeah whatever. Never coming back here again.

"Our trip was booked several weeks prior to our arrival. The self check in booths were declining many booked hotel guests, stating our rooms weren‚Äôt ready and they‚Äôd emhoyelus when it was. It was alr 6pm, and the kiosks weren‚Äôt accurate! The lines after the mass confusion and frustration began and lasted beyond an hour and some for others, with less than minimal staff at the desk to accommodate the error. This is unacceptable.
Mind you, we are here with my step daughter for a cheer competition, so there are many parents and elementary aged and younger children filling this lobby waiting for resolution.
After we‚Äôre able to get checked in, we come up to our room in the west wing‚Ä¶ seriously the most ghetto room I‚Äôve ever stayed in. I would never have anticipated a casino hotel room to be in such dated/dirty/and sloppy conditions. Bathroom is filthy, tub/shower walls stained and smells like cigarette. Cigarette burn hole in bed linen, and the paint job looks like it was done by my grandchildren. The coffee maker is broken and filthy with thick calcium buildup. There isn‚Äôt a dresser to put our clothes away. Mold in the shower molding.
The pictures on your website do NOT portray an image of the trash hole we walked into last night! We‚Äôre beyond disappointed, and have never had an experience as poor as this at any casino we‚Äôve gone to before. I plan on calling the front desk this morning for some kind of resolution.

Manager stated this casino sleeps whatever sum of people and it‚Äôs difficult to keep up and please everyone. Change of room without a guaranteed time and a $50 food and beverage voucher for one of their places within the casino doesn‚Äôt make this stay worth the money I‚Äôve spent at this casino!

"We had an overall great experience! Food selections were fantastic. I'd give it a 4 star but we stayed in the West Tower and it is desperate need of a renovation. Wallpaper peeling, we found a cockroach on the wall and the bedding is very poor quality. Room was freezing with no way to change the temperature.
At the casino, drink service at the table games is SOOOO slow and a soda if you go get your own is $5. There should be drink rounds at least every hour, not 3 hours.
Valet service is super slow so give yourself time.

"Be aware that unless you book directly through the Tropicana hotel (website), you're more likely working with a booking agency (not directly affiliated with the Tropicana Hotel) and you won't  know the total cost of the room until you check in at the hotel.

Your room is subject to taxes and fees (TOURISM FEE/TAX 2; CASINO FEE/TAX 2; A.C. OCC SURCHARGE/TAX 2; RESORT FEE/TAX 2) that booking agents don't disclose when you make and pay for your reservation (a least ours didn't).

These additional fees and taxes increased the cost of the 2-night stay from $92.70 to $184.01.

While the final cost may not be outrageous, it is certainly (at twice the listed nightly rate) more than you expected when you booked the room.

In addition to that, our booking agent charged only $50 (of the total cost of our stay) to my credit card at the time of booking, leaving the remaining balance to be paid at check-in. And the reservation was not confirmed for the section of the hotel whee we prefer to stay.

Our room was cold both nights but after a 'jump start', it started to warm up a bit (recycling regularly on it's own for the 1st time since we arrived). Annoying, yes. But not worth relocating or having to wait for someone from maintenance to show up and address the problem. The room was clean, good sized, uncarpeted, poorly lit (and heated) with just a desk, one lonely desk chair, a safe and mini fridge (that whined) and no microwave.

Spacious bathroom with pull bars in the tub/shower but only one hook to hang things on (towels, PJ's, wash cloths or anything else).

Parking is NOT FREE, but it's reasonable.

As long as you know what to expect when you book, you can relax and enjoy the place.

"Stayed at the north tower with my boyfriend back in September. There was a horrible storm those two days so couldn‚Äôt venture around AC much but we still had a lot of fun as there is plenty of things to do in the resort.

Room/cleanliness: I‚Äôm a smoker (horrible- I know) so I appreciated there being smoking rooms and smoking areas in the casino so I didn‚Äôt need to go out in the wind & rain just to have a smoke.
The room was in a convenient location. Right above the casino and near the elevators. Our window view was overlooking the casino which was pretty cool. The furniture was a little dated and the cleaning was ehh but that‚Äôs pretty much the case with all smoking rooms in any hotel/resort.

Casino: clean. I saw several employees doing detailed cleaning while playing the slots.

Parking: If staying in the North tower, I recommend using the valet. It was very convenient and the charge for it wasn‚Äôt much.

Staff: no complaints about the Tropicana staff. All very friendly and helpful.

Location: perfect location to the boardwalk and beach. I definitely recommend The Rain Forest Cafe located on the boardwalk.

My only 2 complaints (one was my fault).
1.  was our experience at Hooters there. From the moment we walked in the door, the waitress was very rude. Maybe she was having a bad day but it seemed like she took one look at us and assumed we wouldn‚Äôt tip well (we tip a standard 20-30% (depending on service which I think is very fair). We were nothing but kind to her but she was still extremely rude. The other waitress walking around seemed delightful, I wish she was our waitress instead.
Complaint 2: we went during the week days in the fall so the pools weren‚Äôt open. That‚Äôs my bad for not seeing that in their website. So if you want to use a pool, double check the pools are open.
I think all the bad reviews were from people expecting it to be a five star hotel. Most said there wasn‚Äôt much signage for locations but if you look up, there are signs with arrows pointing where to go.

"Tropicana is terrible. First lets start with check in. The line was soooo long. No where to sit . I was very dizzy and was told i had to stand in line. My room was full of mold. I was coughing and sneezing alot. My eyes were itching. So as i started to investigate the room my sheets were dirty. The walls had black drippings rolling down the entire room walls. Maybe water stains but it was yucky! I had a double bed room . The water burned my skin and is difficult to get it to the right temperture. My phone fell and upon pulling the beds  out i saw so much yuck which explains why my allergies were all over the place. The tv was dusty. Towels had burn marks and more.

My eyes were itching. So as i started to investigate the room my sheets were dirty. The walls had black drippings rolling down the entire room walls. Maybe water stains but it was yucky! I had a double bed room . The water burned my skin and is difficult to get it to the right temperture. My phone fell and upon pulling the beds  out i saw so much yuck which explains why my allergies were all over the place. The tv was dusty. Towels had burn marks and more.

"Fantastic location for a short trip around Mt. Shasta.

Our first ever stay here. There are cheaper lodges too in the area but our risk appetite was limited, hence went for this one with higher security and better arrangement in terms of breakfast and room quality.

"Nice grounds an a clean room and bathroom but that's about it.  The shower in the morning was only like warm... very disappointing. The bed was old and brokendown or just incredibly soft and very uncomfortable with small very LUMPY pillows. Worst night of sleep on the trip.

Could not send it back because the ONE server was completely overwhelmed with tables. That said...her service and attitude considering the situation was incredible! She really tried very hard to get to everyone.
It's probably a great place to being kids...nice outdoor courtyards between the buildings and little waterfalls.  There is an indoor pool that looked pretty decent.

It's probably a great place to being kids...nice outdoor courtyards between the buildings and little waterfalls.  There is an indoor pool that looked pretty decent.
With all the disappointment aside, the staff at this hotel is just...WOW!  From the front desk to the maintenance and housekeeping folks...every one of them was super friendly, kind and professional!"
"For a view of Mount Shasta, this place was one of the best in town. It was centrally located, within walking distance to most of the restaurants in town. The rooms itself could use some freshening up, not really outdated, just looked a little tired. Couldn't tell if the refrigerator in the room was working, didn't seem to get particularly cold and there was no adjustment. The restaurant was good but do yourself a favor and DO NOT PURCHASE THE PRE PAID BREAKFAST PACKAGE. They charge you $20 per person for breakfast. You get your choice of one entree and one drink. My wife ordered the Granola and coffee and wanted a bagel. She was told that she would have to pay extra for the bagel even though the total with the bagel wasn't over $20. You're better off paying as you go because you don't get the difference if your total is under $20. Staff was friendly and helpful. Overall, our stay was ok, I'd stay here again if I were in town but I wouldn't pre pay for breakfast again.

Just got a response from Best Western. They state that their breakfast package are $10 for adults and $5 for children. Going through Bookings.com we were charged $20 per person.

We came for 4th of July weekend and our friends booked our Airbnb here at Las Palmas I love the resort entirely! First time in Puero Penasco! So walking from the Condo to the beach was just a few mins so close by the beach. Our view was amazing & breathtaking! The resort pools we absolutely loved and enjoyed. They have the kid family pool area which is impressive cause they have really cool slides and shallow area for littles. Plus offer his eats and antojitos while swimming and lounging. The resort has zero tolerance for partying too late and loud obnoxious ppl will be addressed or kicked out so I like that too.

"Ummm I probably wouldn‚Äôt come here because of the security, they were super strict, couldn‚Äôt do much but then again it‚Äôs their job, but they made us feel uncomfortable. We booked on Expedia which then brought me to Virbo and I had to create an account and the owners name is Tom. It was a little confusing but figured it out.
The apartment was very spacious and clean,to bedrooms and a set of bunk beds, it had everything you need such as laundry soap, condiments, utensils, plates etc. So we were able to grocery shop for the week.
When you go to the pool, the kiddie pool is not warm and there is an adult pool for night. The beach is beautiful but there is always a low tide so you will have to walk a little to get to the water.

The apartment was very spacious and clean,to bedrooms and a set of bunk beds, it had everything you need such as laundry soap, condiments, utensils, plates etc. So we were able to grocery shop for the week.
When you go to the pool, the kiddie pool is not warm and there is an adult pool for night. The beach is beautiful but there is always a low tide so you will have to walk a little to get to the water.

"This is arguably the best sushi in Easton (maybe even the shore)! I've tried all the others and I keep coming back. The staff is friendly and always asks about my family when I come in alone. The wait for food is never long, even if the place is full. You can dine in at lunch and get back to work quick. The menu items consistently taste amazing and are prepared the same way everytime... there are no surprises, if you order an Olympic roll it's going to be amazing Every Single Time, and that surely can not be said for the other places in town. Some of my favorites are ""Amazing Tuna"" ""Jingle Bell"" ""Olympic"" ""Incredible"" and ""spicey crab"" but all of them are good. If you go between 12 and 4 the special is ""get 1 special roll and get a second at half off"".

"If you are looking to stay at a top-notch hotel. The Best Western Premier Bridgewood (Neenah) is an excellent choice. Our family of 4 stayed here recently while on our family vacation and stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which is a must for us with two teenagers. Each of the kids had their own bed in their own room, we had a separate room with a king bed and there was also a spacious family room. Three 65 inch tvs in each space kept everyone entertained during our downtime. The room was clean, nice and spacious. The hotel itself was very clean and nice in all areas. The pool is nicer than average hotel pools featuring a shallow wading pool for small children and main pool with basketball hoop and a larger slide for older kids. Two hot tubs one indoors and one outside were nice and relaxing. On site restaurant was very good and convenient to get to within the hotel.

My family came here as opposed to a big waterpark hotel to hopefully experience a smaller crowd and quieter atmosphere to get away in the winter cold. The stay was overall enjoyable.

"Please note: NO WHEELCHAIR or STROLLER access on the day of our visit. There is one small elevator serving all of Quincy Market and if it‚Äôs inop - you cannot access the Dino Safari since it‚Äôs located up a huge flight of stairs. They suggested we carry the stroller upstairs. Not possible due to weight of stroller & 19-month old ‚Äî but also not safe for child. The folks at Dino Safari said they‚Äôve ‚Äúbeen asking‚Äù them to fix the elevator for some time.

"Main takeaways: not worth the price, but the kids did have fun. The exhibit was small, very warm (no ac even in Summer), and the main thing is that the dinosaurs appear to be inflatable? And in very poor condition (missing teeth, hair and feathers missing in large patches, sections of the inflatable not working etc.) the lighting is also very low and odd. It seems designed to be scary and colorful maybe, instead of actually being able to see any detailing on the creatures. I paid $25 per person (including the kids) and you can see the exhibit in 15-20 minutes (reading all of the educational material). It just isn‚Äôt worth it.

The only reason this isn‚Äôt a 1 star or a complaint to the organization for a refund, is that the kids did have fun. The dinosaurs are touchable (probably why they are in such terrible condition).

"At best, I'm a novice at the aquarium hobby. I've been setting up an aquarium and navigating all the intricacies that comes with setting up a new aquarium. In doing so, a social media aquarium hobby group recommended the Austin Aqua Dome as a solid, local hub for hobbyists. During my visit, I was greeted and invited to ask any questions I might have.

The building calls back to the ""Keep Austin Weird"" idea in both supporting a local business *and* being a wonderfully unique shopping experience in offering an infinite collection of aquarium related materiel to purchase- from fresh water to salt/marine, from ponds, to desktop bowls and extravagant custom aquariums. My overall experience was akin to me being a kid going on a great field trip like a previous visitor mentioned in their review.

Though I am still waiting to introduce fish to my aquarium, I was able to have questions answered about different live plants suitable to my experience and want for the type of fish community I'll eventually be keeping. I was introduced to a myriad of different plant varieties and they had a wonderfully diverse set of options to choose from. I ended up purchasing 5 plants of two different kinds and a wonderful piece of prepared driftwood for my setup. I also bought a plant solution to introduce and maintain for my water that promotes growth. Finally, because I look to continue my business relationship with Austin Aqua Dome, I purchased a one year membership that will likely pay for itself as my odyssey into this passtime grows.

We reserved a room with two Queen beds and a room with a king. Both rooms were great, but the king room was extra special for my wife and I. We loved it. I would have even enjoyed sleeping on the balcony! Hahahahahaha!

"Typically I am quite skeptical about these corporate run places or attractions like this. Especially when they're located in a mall or something of that fashion. In my opinion they tend to be more of a gimmick than an actual fun and educational experience.
That being said, you should also know that if you're expecting something like one of those very large public aquariums that everyone raves about, this very much isn't that in any way shape or form (and that's okay). It is however much larger than what you might be anticipating if you're basing things on how the outside of the building looks.

I say all of that, to say this. Even though this place isn't of the caliber of many major city aquariums, it does have to some great qualities for what it is. I wound up here because my Fianc√© and I decided it would be a good weekend adventure for the kids, and as it turned out, we were right.

One of the major perks right off the bat is the fact that they often are only taking guests that buy tickets in advance (at least this was the case while we were there), meaning it is much less busy than it would be if they were letting everyone walk up and buy tickets. I feel that this really made for a less congested and more personal experience with the kids.

I don't know exactly what I was expecting for the price of a ticket here, but I do feel like it was absolutely worth it, not only for the kids, but for the adults as well. There were certain periods throughout the experience that I think I was probably more excited to see a certain animal than my ten year old son was. The way this place is set up is basically you're in an undersea maze where you continue on, learning about and seeing all sorts of creatures, eventually ending up at the end (a.k.a the gift shop). There are also parts where you're able to interact and be hands on with certain sea creatures, and that was pretty entertaining as well.

There are not only quite a few creatures (both salt and freshwater) to take a gander at but also several activities for the kids to take part in during the whole experience. This place also makes it incredibly easy to be able to see everything no matter how big or small you are (you'll see what I mean when you walk through). You might even get the opportunity to see several of the creatures eat, which can be quite fascinating. Specifically the Stingrays, I mean have you ever seen a Stingray eat? Probably not, and you totally have the ability to here.

When all is said and done, should this act as a replacement for those gigantic public aquariums that many cities have? Absolutely not, but oftentimes not everyone has access to those places or those specific aquariums, and this would probably be the next best thing in my opinion.
The staff here is also friendly, professional, and seemingly quite knowledgeable about the sea creatures they keep, which was refreshing to see.
I truly believe that if you can separate the fact that you're not going to get the full ""aquarium"" experience that you might get at those other very well known gigantic aquariums, then you can truly have a great time here, especially if you bring the kids.

"Came here originally on my birthday last year . The food is just amazing. The chef / owner is from Italy and knows how to cook. The homemade pastas were amazing , the staff knew what kind of wine my wife needed , as their wine menu was very overwhelming. Huge wine menu lol .

My wife wanted come back on Valentine‚Äôs Day weekend on a Saturday , and it was such a lovey experience ..... we started with the fried calamari. It was crunchy and tender. Got a nice $30 of Cabernet and it was smooth. I don‚Äôt really drink wine but I was able to drink a whole bottle with wifey . Next we got a shrimp / crab dish and 4 cheese ravioli. Outstanding entrees. Didn‚Äôt look like much but we were very stuffed . Last was our lime something cake ....

We did come at 8pm so the crowd died down so our service was pretty spot on .

Love love love this place !

Just came here on a Monday for my bday and it was perfect ! When we got there at 6pm there was only us and another table. We practically had the restaurant for a good 30 minutes to ourselves . Usually this place is packed but probably due to covid it has slowed down. They closed their larger dining area. We had a bottle of wine , few appetizers , and two main courses ! Our food was awesome ! And service was great ! Wish it was busier so the restaurant stays in business.

It was as though some artificial intelligence program was assigned the task to create Italian food.

"Excellent service, friendly staff, huge wine list and tasty food. We had a great bottle of Chianti. Then we split the calamari and caprese. The calamari was perfectly cooked, not chewy at all. I saw the guy in the kitchen breading it. The caprese was honestly one of the best I've had. Being winter, the tomato wasn't the best but the mozzarella was perfect. It was topped with a delicious pesto. And the plate was drizzled with the thickest balsamic glaze I've ever had. It was almost like caramel. The balsamic glaze was extremely flavorful. For our main courses, we had the Tuscan Nido and the wild mushroom Tagliatelle. The Tuscan Nido was basically a giant ravioli. The filling had great flavor. I loved the pops of whole peppercorn and the fried sage leaves. The pasta was clearly homemade and perfect. The wild mushroom Tagliatelle was even better. The mushroom flavor was amazing and the smell was just divine. Normally, I would have liked to see the addition of truffle to a dish like this but honestly, I think it was near perfect without. The mushrooms just had such good flavor. To top off our meal, the lady who seated us came around to see how our meal was. Based on our conversation, I assume she was the owner.

"Cute restaurant! We got our own little corner behind curtain, it was quite perfect for a group of loud kids and adults.

Meatballs and the sauces were very good!!! The other entrees portions are all too big. Seafood risotto was not bad, I would prefer the seafood not cooked so much that they were a bit chewy.

We all laughed over the one giant piece of ravioli, that was not expected. It smelled really good and was told that it tasted very good too.

They have a large menu of wine by glass and by bottle. Cocktail menu was pretty standard.

"Rarely do I give a bad review ....but....
Disgusting.  If only zero stars were available.  Place needs a full cleaning. Maybe rip out disgusting carpet and try vinyl flooring... Plastic cutlery? Maybe since covid?   But had to ask for it vs getting at payment and entering.
Many tables were not wiped down without asking after awaiting a significant time. Unused tables stacked with piles of dishes. This st 4pm so not a full dinner rush.   I'd hate to see it during rush time.

The buffet had many empty pans due to non attention.

I've been  to several Golden Corral in many other major city centres. And this so far by far has been the worst!

"Today my family and I arrived at Golden Corral in Sterling Heights Michigan and were extremely disgusted with what we saw.

After paying (over $60) we finally found a table that was clean. When we went to the bar, we saw nothing but food thrown all over the floor, the bar was disgustingly dirty, and completely empty. Servers and the manager were just walking through the food all over the floor, never cleaning anything at all. It was so bad, I decided to take photos as well for you.

After sitting down, it took us 15 minutes to get silverware, and over 25 min to get drinks. Our server never cleared the plates from our table when needed either.

As for at the bar; the woman doing the steaks was more interested in flirting and trying to get a date with a customer than actually helping customers, cleaning anything, or even putting steaks on the grill. The salad bar was basically full of rotting fruit and slimy lettuce.

At the desert bar, there was chicken on the floor, food everywhere. My biggest concern was the fact that there were peanuts all over the bar, mixed into other toppings, on the cookies, on the brownies, etc. As someone with an extreme nut allergy, this type of cross contamination is deadly, let alone disgusting.

For $60 my family and I ate one plate of food that was cold by the time we got our silverware because the bar was empty and never refilled. I understand that places may be short staffed but that is not an excuse for any of this. If the health department would have walked in, the place would have been closed immediately‚Ä¶.and honestly should have. When the manager, the staff, the servers, and guests are having to walk through food on the floor and nothing is being cleaned or refilled, that‚Äôs awful. We have been here several times and this is the most disgusting restaurant I have ever seen.

After sitting down, it took us 15 minutes to get silverware, and over 25 min to get drinks. Our server never cleared the plates from our table when needed either.

As for at the bar; the woman doing the steaks was more interested in flirting and trying to get a date with a customer than actually helping customers, cleaning anything, or even putting steaks on the grill. The salad bar was basically full of rotting fruit and slimy lettuce.

At the desert bar, there was chicken on the floor, food everywhere. My biggest concern was the fact that there were peanuts all over the bar, mixed into other toppings, on the cookies, on the brownies, etc. As someone with an extreme nut allergy, this type of cross contamination is deadly, let alone disgusting.

For $60 my family and I ate one plate of food that was cold by the time we got our silverware because the bar was empty and never refilled. I understand that places may be short staffed but that is not an excuse for any of this. If the health department would have walked in, the place would have been closed immediately‚Ä¶.and honestly should have. When the manager, the staff, the servers, and guests are having to walk through food on the floor and nothing is being cleaned or refilled, that‚Äôs awful. We have been here several times and this is the most disgusting restaurant I have ever seen.

The photos shown below are just some of the photos I took. The entire restaurant was like this."

"Would highly recommend this great little Campground. The property was clean, very well kept, and had everything you could need. Play Set for kids, cozy tent & RV sites, coin operated showers, laundry, dishwashing station and even a place for fishermen to clean their catch. Convenient store with the basics as well as some handmade goods and local foods. The quaint little grill in the back makes a mean burger and has tons of food options. I enjoyed the seafood basket which was plentiful (shrimp, clam, scallops & fries).
Everyone we came into contact with was friendly and helpful. The only downside I might mention is that there is only of toilet and one shower for the whole park. We came in the off season, so this was no big deal. Not sure what it would be like in the busy season.
Overall a great place and we loved our stay! Will be returning for sure! Location is key and this place is perfectly situated between, Rialto Beach, La Push, Forks, & the Hoh. Didn‚Äôt hurt that they fully embrace the Twilight mania that has over taken this area either.

"You will miss your bed at home real quick! The only thing keeping me from giving a two star or worse rating was the fantastic customer service: front desk, housekeeping, and the breakfast attendant. Otherwise this Hilton-brand Hampton Inn and Suites is not worth the higher price point than many of the other options in Aberdeen and is way overdue for a refresh (maybe we can blame Covid-19). The colors and finishes in the lobby, halls and rooms are dinged, scuffed and just plain ugly. The king-sized bed in our non-suite room was caving in and needing replacement. When booking, be aware not all the rooms are like the pictures on the site, some are very plain with no kitchenette, just an awkward mini fridge and microwave by the desk in the room. No real dresser if you like to unpack just a small hutch with sticking drawers that the TV sits on. Pull out style love seat sofa seemed like a great option for the kids, but the window was very drafty and our son about froze the first night. The blankets were very thin waffle weave style. We asked for a second for the next night and he put on extra clothes and was okay. Not comfortable enough for an adult, he slept on it backwards, because even he could feel the metal. The bathroom was a good size which was nice for a family traveling with younger kids, but the bathroom fixtures were loose and the shower almost didn't work. The toilet took several flushes. The pillows in our room weren't the usual mixture of firm and soft (feather and polyfill as it turned out for here), but housekeeping brought us new ones when we inquired at the front desk during breakfast. The breakfast was quite good. Many choices, including an oatmeal area with fixings, plus other hot options, waffles, fresh fruit, yogurt, biscuits and gravy one morning and the next eggs and sausage patties. Coffee options were hot. Pool and hot tub area was small, but we had fun anyways. Pool towels were restocked regularly. Elevator floor became sticky one evening, but as we were in and out, right away they had it mopped I noticed. Again, great customer service that way. We also did laundry which was weirdly on the second floor off in the corner, kinda creepy, but washing and each dry cycle was just a dollar in quarters.

"Let me begin by saying that Evermore has such great potential!
The young ladies who greeted us at the front entrance were incredibly helpful! Rebecca and Lee - 5
The young ladies at the archery -5
The haunted house- 3 very creative
Park set up: 4
Park amenities: 1
It is not disability friendly at all!
I asked to rent a electric scooter
I have ms and it‚Äôs difficult to walk.
Someone stole the one scooter they had? üòÜ lol thats a first
Food- 1
What a joke. They have a very nice restaurant set up
But it only serves 2 desserts that could pass for McDonald‚Äôs $1 desserts
They have smaller getups
They open at 6 food (can beef stew and Mac n cheese or chicken nuggets and fries sold out by 8
We had to wait literally 30 min and another 30 min for chicken nuggets
The food definitely not amusement park quality.
Park Combo- 1
The train ride was down
I asked for a bottle water to go towards my drink
I was handed a warm bottle of water straight from the case of water plastic bag!
The guy was literally opening the can of beef stew while we waited lol
They also had a microwave
$1 dessert
A large bread bowl with a small scoop of canned beef stew

This is obviously a much smaller cave system and park than mammoth caves.  However mammoth caves while impressive due to size doesn't really have quite as much cave feel to it because of that size... That being said these are not claustrophobic caves that make you crawl on your hands and knees it's just most areas are closer to a standard hallway with larger rooms scattered here and there.

"We really enjoyed the X-cave and Cascade cave tours. My 10 and 9 year old sons preferred the X cave as their favorite   due to it being narrower and trickier to navigate through.

"The rooms are great. Occasional ant, fly etc.- but you should expect that in a lodge near woods. The room felt clean. The balcony is wonderful. Only thing I missed was my pillows. Their pillows are not the greatest. So you may want to bring your own. We were there on a weekday, so the restaurant didn't stay open as late. But we were still able to order pizza and have it delivered. Tyler's Pizza is AMAZING. You have access to the campground pool. We didn't do this though. The food we had at lunch in the lodge restaurant was great. The waitress was a very charming, young blonde. Very sweet.
The cave tours were super easy to sign up for. Took like 2 mins. We took the Cascades tour and we were fortunate to get to do the Ghost and Legends tour which was a lantern tour of the Saltpeter Cave (a portion) and the X Cave by Mason. The lantern tour was SUPER cool. Highly recommend. Wish there was a way to tip your tour guides. They do great. We also took a hike on the 3 bridge trail. (3.8 miles I think)
Beautiful scenery. Wish there were markers saying how much further you had. It's hard to keep track when you have a tour later in the day.  Overall, this is good for a day/ 1 overnight trip. We did everything we wanted to do almost in a day. The park is well taken care of. If we had stayed another night, boredom could set in.

"So it's very confusing but we stayed at the Carter Caves Campground not the resort or cabins.
We arrived one day early figured we would try our luck. We were met on the office by a disinterested kid. Once we got through that, we discovered that our sight #8, had the electric pedestal aprox 75' from the site.
We returned to the office and were moved to sight #3. Once we backed in, we discovered that the electric pedestal had 20 or 50 Amp. No 30.
Back again and moved into #6. It worked but I had to back all the way to the end of the pad and my power cord just made it.
Water took two hoses to reach and had to wrap to the opposite side of the camper.
We had a nice view but the picnic table was not usable due the the slope.
The showers were ok but the curtain bottom was covered with mold.
Overall a busy Campground, dogs and some guy in a tow truck that liked to let everyone know he had an air horn.

Such a fun place! Tons of trails of varied difficulty. It's a lot better in the summer than fall/winter because leaves obscure the trails so it's easy to go the wrong way in the colder seasons. You'll need a caving permit to actually explore the caves or take one of the guided tours.

You'll need a caving permit to actually explore the caves or take one of the guided tours.

"Went to Carter Caves to watch the magician Mike and dinner for Valentines.  I highly recommend.  The dinner was booked by tables, you went downstairs by tables then to the buffet so there was no mad rush or long lines.
The buffet was great and had three entree choices, chicken, prime rib and something else.  A good sale, mashed taters, Brussels sprouts, green beans and rolls were other choices.  The desert bar had chocolate candies, strawberries covered in chocolate, cupcakes, banana pudding and a chocolate cake so yummy.

"Why Eagle Harbor is the place you want to stay when in Door County?
Eagle Harbor is located right accross the bay and walking distance to Penninsula State Park. When we entered the property it was beautifully places homes giving you a royal feel of a town. The homes B&Bs are well kept and looks eye pleasing. Upon checking in the host was very friendly and informative about door county. They made us feel home. He check us in and off we went to our room Tilla. Tilla was the 1st room up the stairs on your left. Room was rather small but well designed and very cozy. The antique looks gave it a very stylish english look. The washroom was large enough and had a sky light to it. B&B main building was well decorated (pics attached) and well kept.

Eagle Harbor is located right accross the bay and walking distance to Penninsula State Park. When we entered the property it was beautifully places homes giving you a royal feel of a town. The homes B&Bs are well kept and looks eye pleasing. Upon checking in the host was very friendly and informative about door county. They made us feel home. He check us in and off we went to our room Tilla. Tilla was the 1st room up the stairs on your left. Room was rather small but well designed and very cozy. The antique looks gave it a very stylish english look. The washroom was large enough and had a sky light to it. B&B main building was well decorated (pics attached) and well kept.

"Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have anything good to say about Gaia house . When we were sat down there was paint bubbling near us, probably due to moisture trapped behind the paint. And then a leak above. It‚Äôs not really an appetizing sight.

We were told that we wouldn‚Äôt be able to have espresso or lattes because the espresso machine was down. That‚Äôs fine. What I did take issue with was the self serve coffee station. For one, the way the glasses were stored was gross. The shelves were not clean. The cups were freshly washed. I could tell because they were wet, placed rim down. So that the dust and debris on the shelving was collected on the wet rims of the cups. And whenever you picked up a cup you could see the wet rim marked it left. These cups should be dry if you‚Äôre going to store them rim down. Drying them rim down traps the moisture inside (causing an unpleasant odor and taste), and damages the shelves, and is altogether unsanitary if the shelves aren‚Äôt even clean. Storing them rim side up would be a better option in this case . They are used often enough for collecting dust to be an argument for storing them rim side down. Sanitary conditions aside, for a vegan/vegetarian place for the only milk option to be whole milk was disappointing. Consider offering milk alternatives.

The food was even more disappointing . My guest ate his omelet , but I good not stomach my food. The cornbread French toast was incredibly dry, even soaking it in the butter and syrup didn‚Äôt revive it. The potatoes tasted fine but they were stale. Since it was the only semi edible thing available to me I picked at that instead of what I ordered. I only managed to eat half of one slice of French toast and didn‚Äôt want to take it home.

Sanitary conditions aside, for a vegan/vegetarian place for the only milk option to be whole milk was disappointing. Consider offering milk alternatives.

The food was even more disappointing . My guest ate his omelet , but I good not stomach my food. The cornbread French toast was incredibly dry, even soaking it in the butter and syrup didn‚Äôt revive it. The potatoes tasted fine but they were stale. Since it was the only semi edible thing available to me I picked at that instead of what I ordered. I only managed to eat half of one slice of French toast and didn‚Äôt want to take it home. We came out of our way to go here after seeing it on Instagram. So it was that much more disappointing."

"Gaia House Cafe was very nice. The decor is slightly bohemian and very cozy with mismatched chairs and tables.We went on a Tuesday at lunch and got the Gaia Tempeh Ruben and the Banh Mi sandwiches.The coffee was excellent. The staff was very pleasant and the food arrived in good time. The price seemed a little steep for sandwiches but when you get homemade pickles and kraut it makes up for it. I couldn't tell where a good place to park would be, so we parked in the Irish pub reserved area with a risk of towing.

Some things to consider: add a bit more spread on the Banh Mi as it was a little dry; add a few completely vegan options to the menu as many of the entrees are so close but then have cheese; swap out those potato chips for a cup of soup.

"Gaia's open for in house dining and if you use to frequent the old Gaia in East Town you will be familiar with the menu. No meat is served but don't let that stop you.

"Enjoyed a nice breakfast today at Gaia. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. Our party of six was seated immediate on a Saturday morning.

Unpretentious, casual, warm interior. Small menu, but nice to have so many vegetarian and vegan options. Good to have the opportunity to try something different, outside the normal brunch fare.

I stuck with what I normally like - eggs & potatoes plus tried a fruit cup. It was a filling portion and cooked well. The potatoes were well seasoned and crispy. I also enjoyed the sourdough bread that came with my meal. The fruit was fresh and seasonal. Coffee was self-service and offered three options, with creamer available at request. I tried the Swiss chocolate brew and liked it a lot. My friend‚Äôs specialty French toasted looked amazing. It has tender sweet saut√©ed apples, cherry sauce, and almonds.

"4/5 stars because I wasn't super impressed with the overall offerings of live species.
I do love the design of the aquarium and the overall feel when you walk in to the penguin exhibit.

I've been to some great aquariums and I missed the sharks and the sea otters and in Oregon they even had an orca-which happened to be in the movie, Free Willy. Although that was years ago they still have a fantastic exhibit with many more species.

I don't want to be too harsh of a critic, but I was a bit underwhelmed.

I did enjoy the penguin exhibit, the seals and the big sea turtles.

The feel tank had stingrays alone. It was fine, but many feel tanks usually have starfish and other sea urchins. As well as someone commentating.

It was pretty busy and hard to get good pictures, since everybody else is trying to do the same thing.

Cute for kids or just a date. It‚Äôs the perfect size for them and easy to navigate since it‚Äôs just a big circle. It seems that they really care for their animals which is so important.

"A must-visit on any trip to Boston. The Aquarium is beautiful and wonderful and all superlatives rolled into one, when it comes to an educational venue.

Turtles, sharks, penguins, seals, eels, jellyfish, rays you can pet...this place never loses its appeal for me. It's mesmerizing and calming and breathtaking in the diversity of natural beauty. A fascinating treasure of New England.

Expect to spend about 1.5-2 hours here if you really want to take it in and learn about the sea life and ecology; 1 hour even if you visit it like an art museum and let the beauty and color wash over your vision.

"Overall, this is a really nice aquarium. The primary wow factor is realizing it's virtually all contained in one large atrium with a spiral walkway up the center and an open-air penguin exhibit across the entire bottom of the room. I love penguins, so being able to see them up close and from slightly above with no glass between us was really fascinating. I also loved the seal and sea lion exhibits being outside (yet covered). It adds a more natural feel to the area, which I'm sure the animals enjoy.

I think my only complaint would be that it seems a little small for the ticket price, especially compared to other aquariums across the country. If you purchase a combo pass with other attractions, I'm sure it's a better value. However, all that being said, I was impressed with the number of displays they were able to fit into the space.

"Cute aquarium. I‚Äôll lay out the pros and cons to help anyone visiting Boston for a few days decide whether coming here is worth it or not.

Cons:
I wasn‚Äôt a fan of layout of the building itself and the flow between exhibits was kind of awkward. Also, the touch tanks (ie where the sharks and rays are) are right at the entrance and easy to pass by when you enter. If you go into the gift shop before seeing that area you won‚Äôt be able to come back in without showing your ticket again which is kind of annoying.

The ticket price was also kind of expensive for the size of the aquarium ($34) considering there isn‚Äôt that much to see and you‚Äôll probably spend 1.5-2h there at most. The gift shop has only a few items with the cute logo on it and the rest have tacky clip art on them that you wouldn‚Äôt even be able to tell came from this specific aquarium. They should at least put Boston on there or something.

Pros:
Some of the habitats are so creatively curated, from the shape of the glass to the way they planted the vegetation, it‚Äôs all very pleasing to the eye. If you go in the morning you can see the animals being fed which is extra entertaining. They all seem happy especially the turtles who you can see love to be handled by the marine biologists.

"As a fan of the film Next Stop Wonderland, the New England Aquarium was a must-see during my visit to Boston, and it did not disappoint!  The aquarium offers a AAA discount and a university discount. Upon entering, I turned to the left to the sting ray petting experience and shark exhibit.  This was the first of multiple stops where aquarium staff were on hand to share information and answer questions, which was great! I appreciated the washing station, too. The shark exhibit was interactive and engaging.  I could go on about the multiple exhibits and aquariums in the main building, but the jewel of this Aquarium is the enormous, multi-story tank featuring sea turtles, schools of fish, and the scuba divers feeding them.  I suggest calling ahead to find out when the feeding time will be so that you don‚Äôt miss it! See if you can find the small Puffer fish in that large tank; it‚Äôs not easy, but worth seeing that friendly little face! üòä if you turn to the right as you enter the main space, you will find a flashlight attached to the railing that allows you to play with the penguins!

We had an amazing time at the New England Aquarium. As we slowly walked up the spiral staircase we enjoyed observing the fish in their natural habitat.

"We were driving from Portland home to Canada and it was getting quite late so we found the little town of Shelton and it seemed like a convenient place to stop, being only an hour and a half from the Port Angeles Ferry. We googled a place to stay in Shelton and there was a very limited selection so we pulled into a couple and looked for reviews. Let‚Äôs just say they sounded like rat motels from what we read from other travellers. Once we saw there was a Super 8 in Shelton it seemed like the natural place to say as they are typically a decent place to stay being a franchise and all.

We checked in around 8pm and the front desk person was friendly although seemingly bored with his job. The lobby was clean and nice. We had a truck full of purchases that we didn‚Äôt want to leave outside overnight so it was nice that there was an emergency door close to where we parked for bringing all our stuff in. The front desk person did state that the hotel was located in a decent part of town and our stuff would probably be fine.

We paid $70 for the night which was high considering it was a fairly old hotel. It appeared to have been renovated at one point but the work was amateur at best. There were simple things like repairs to the towel bar which were just never painted over. Little touches like that go unnoticed when done but become BIG eyesores when left not finished. The temperature in the room was hard to keep consistent. I had to keep turning on and off the heat because the room likely is not well insulated. The bath towels were small and the caulking around the tub was gross. There was a mini fridge and coffee area, which was a nice touch. We could hear the voices from the other rooms and the aroma of the Mary J was thick in the hallways. We did not stay for the breakfast unfortunately as we were up and out to head for the ferry.

We didn‚Äôt use any of the amenities, we literally just used this hotel to sleep as a crash pad and it did its job. We felt it was pretty clean and mostly quiet and if we had to stay in Shelton again this would definitely be our first stop.

"Went today for a 5th birthday party. Place is nice,  not in the best area of town though...... But overall this place was pretty nice.  Good layout and plenty of places for kids to play.

"A really beautiful Zoo! They have taken advantage of San Antonio's rocky terrain to create some very well landscaped animal enclosures for all of the animals as well as having trees, flowers, cactuses, and ponds laid out throughout the zoo. It was kind of a cold and rainy day the day we went and a lot of the animals were not having any part of it electing to sleep out of the weather in their enclosures, but we still enjoyed it very much! They have a nice reptile house with lots of snakes, lizards, and turtles. They also have a sea life house that has both fresh water and salt water fish and turtles! There are plenty of refreshment stands spaced out around the grounds as well as restrooms and hand wash stations. There are areas under construction and we went in through the Blue entrance, I believe the regular entrance might be the orange entrance, but it was closed.

"We were lucky to witness a lot of the animals enjoying their lunch on Valentine's day! Many had stuffed animals in their areas (cute..  but the monkeys looked confused). lol

The day and the weather were perfect! Some areas were closed off in preparation for their Valentine's dinner event, totally understandable. Truly makes us feel like we need to go back soon to see everything we missed!

"Everything from start to finish was fantastic! The onion soup was flavorful and did not need the Gruy√®re cheese, but the cheese made it better. Perfect for a cold winter night! The steak tartare was also flavored well with peppers and the perfect ratio to the sauce. The chips made it even better. The duck breast matched well with the parsnip pur√©e and was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The flavor profile had a gamier edge. The portion sizes were generous, and there were extra duck pieces mixed in with the vegetables. The cocktails were a delight: my old fashioned had a clear, custom cut ice cube that added to the aesthetic charm. The drink tasted better over time as the ice melted.

"We had a wonderful experience at Westchester for lunch! The decor is beautiful and the ‚Äúvibe‚Äù inside is welcoming and cozy but also hip. I ordered the grilled chicken mezze salad and it was beautiful, but also delicious. The duck fat truffle fries were also phenomenal. We brought our kids (7 and 4) so Chef Matt made them a grilled cheese (he also added delicious crispy fries) and amazing buttered noodles. He even sent our server, Olivia, out to double check that multi grain bread was ok for the grilled cheese. Olivia was a wonderful server as well and knew everything about the menu, and the owner was there at the host stand greeting people as they came in. There was a big table of women having a fun lunch and the bar was full of groups of men hanging out as well. I am born and raised in Chesterfield and it‚Äôs totally unique and awesome for the area.

"My son took me on a trip to Savannah for my birthday. I can't begin to even explain how impressed I was with Hyatt Regency Savannah. When you pull up...valet and busboy. Check-in was seamless.

We had it to ourselves for nearly two hours. The room was immaculate! I e worked in the hotel industry...the housekeepers there don't skip any steps. I appreciate that.

My wife and I had a very nice stop over here while traveling. The hotel has recently been updated and it's very well done. The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable.

"Great location.  Inadequate housekeeping for a hotel of that standard and price.  A big pile of hair, yes indeed a pile, had been left in the shower drain.

Overpriced 7-inch pizzas for $16 per person, which fortunately tasted good, but $50 for 2 small pizzas and 2 beers... That's ridiculous.

"I've stayed at numerous Hyatt Regencys throughout the world. I've never stayed at such a filthy Hyatt. Far from the one in Bangkok.
Throughout the room you see long-term grime, dried unknown fluids on the floors, doors, doorknobs, cabinets, and counters!!
It's so obvious that nobody has deeply cleaned this room for months if not longer. The room smelled exactly like the damp scent I've experienced while staying on offshore fishing boats.
The soap dish is broken and sharp.
My colleague has empty beer bottles on the top shelf in her closet. Toothpaste on the bathroom walls near the mirror. The mirror is filthy as are the grimy glass shower doors.
There's pink mildew growing all over the shower tiles. The towels are the worst. Super thin and non-absorbent. The pillows are terrible and the mattress is too firm. The blanket was so thin it didn't feel luxurious in any way. Lastly, there was some brown liquid dried on the toilet lid.

"We stayed for an overnight stay this past weekend and had a wonderful time! We were in a poolside room which had a door right into the indoor pool. This was so nice to be able to walk right out, swim, and head right back into our room. The room was clean and comfortable and had plenty of space. The outdoor pool is a good size and has plenty of seating available. We used the mobile app for check-in, check-out, and the key to our room which worked great and it was so nice to not have to go to the front desk for anything.

We explored the hotel and the event rooms were so beautiful. The location isn't directly near much, but it is pretty close to downtown Lancaster which had some great restaurants and shopping.

The main issue I think worth noting is that the wifi in the hotel, at least in our room, was basically unusable. We had to use mobile data to use the internet and the app for our room key.

Absolutely loved our experience! Our daughter had requested a night at a hotel with a swimming pool for her birthday. We had made mention of this to staff when booking and asked for a ballon in the room as something special. Staff went above and beyond by including some snacks for her as well as a card in addition to the ballon. Needless to say our 4 yr old freaked out when she saw it. Thank you so much to the staff that made our night special for our girl! We got a poolside room and so we were able to make the most of our time swimming. Our room was spacious and clean.

"Overall, we had a good stay. Came here with my sisters, mother, and nieces for a girls night out. The room was clean and comfortable but a bit dated. Staff were friendly and helpful during our stay.

The pool was heated, but it was still cold in my opinion. They ran out of towels when I had arrived to the pool so I had to wait until I was ready to leave and they had just restocked the towels. The playground was small, but nice. The basketball court was also nice. The table tennis could have been maintained better, the net was broken so was the 1 paddle that was at the table. While I was there the restaurant was closed for renovations. So were unable to get room service despite the front desk telling me the other restaurant was opened, but I was unable to get connected to that restaurant.

"Been coming here for years, beautiful hotel, great salt water indoor pool & spa. Heated outdoor pool open until end of October. Also outside has small playground, basketball, pool table, ping pong table, shuffle board & bocce. Reasons for 3 stars, 1. had absolutely no WiFi the entire 4 days their in our room. It was located poolside by the indoor pool. WiFi worked outside of room & in lobby though. Spoke to front desk twice, & they said they didn‚Äôt need to come to the b/c router was outside of room. Was texting with someone & they gave me the password to another WiFi, but that didn‚Äôt work in the room. 2. Weddings all weekend so very hard to get a parking spot at night. Rooms lack USB ports to charge devices. No more free coffee in lobby. Gave a card now for towels, 1 towel per card, if you don‚Äôt turn card back in $25 charge, see pic.

"We checked in today and so far this place has exceeded our expectations. Staff has been incredibly friendly and helpful. We checked into on of the suites snd recived a text from.

The room is wonderful, very clean  and modern. See pics. Were going to us the heated pool , hot tub and will try the on site restaurant, will update our review post.
Update, we did goto the indoor pool and it was enchanting. Indoor heated pool was great. You get cards for towel service when you check in and get a fresh towel when you arrive to the pool. The jacuzzi was corded off due to maintenance. While that was dissapointing for our evening I greatly appreciated thier concern for guests safety.
We also had dinner at the restaurant and that was incredible. They have this seafood dish with a tomato broth that was divine. Everyone in our party raved about thier food.
Breakfast, we would advise to skip the buffet, it was not up to the rest of the standards. Pastries were days old, the hot fares were mediocre.  The fruit was nice but that was not worth the price. So I would suggest breakfast offsite and there close places to choose from.

"My Family & I Visited ""RED LOBSTER"" on McKnight Road for the 1st Time yesterday (6-10-18). We took My Wife there for Her BIRTHDAY & We TOTALLY Enjoyed Our lunch.

"This place doesn‚Äôt look like much when you pull up, but once inside you can tell that they take pride in this hotel.
Everything in the lobby was very clean, neat and orderly. It looked like this place had been remodeled recently.
The breakfast and sitting area are located right off of the main entrance across from the lobby.
It too was very clean and neat.
I stopped here for one night on my return trip home from Florida.
I always choose a Best Western because the rooms are very clean, they give you complimentary toiletries, blow dryer, iron and ironing board, a coffee pot and free coffee in your room. You also get a refrigerator and microwave in your room and free WiFi.
I always try to get a king size bedroom. The beds are super comfortable, and I‚Äôm able to get a good nights sleep.
With my room came with a complimentary breakfast. This is standard with most Best Westerns.
This Smithville Best Western has an indoor pool which is permanently closed and a gym. I did not use them.
For breakfast they serve scrambled eggs, ham or bacon, grits, homemade waffles, that you make yourself. Cold cereal, oatmeal, fresh fruit, yogurt, biscuits and sausage gravy, bagels, toast, muffins, pastries, coffee, tea, juices, or milk. You can have as much as you want. The breakfast is constantly replenished by a sweet older lady.
Checkin was very easy. The front desk staff was extremely nice, and made some recommendations when we asked. They have a free parking lot.

"This review is about the hotel itself. Big pluses it's location (less than 40 minutes drive from DC) and direct connection to the casino and just 3 minutes walk to the center of the shopping mall.

The staff is attentive (some reviews mentioned that staff were rude - nothing like that here). Check in and check out was a breeze. So, why 4 stars?

The food they offer at luckies you can find at orchid kitchen which is also the envivo restaurant in one.

"La Creme is a chic creperie located on Main St in Zeeland. The space is bright and airy which makes for the absolute cutest place to have brunch!!

The wonderful thing about La Creme is that they have both sweet AND savory crepes!! If you wouldn‚Äôt call yourself a sweet tooth, then you are in luck because their menu includes some crazy amazing savory crepe options!

Their savory crepes are also naturally gluten-free: BONUS!

And it is SO FUN to watch them make the crepes as they add in all of the yum that it‚Äôs filled with and then fold it into a delicious MASTERPIECE üí´

Because I meannnn do you SEE how beautiful those are?! ü§©

While their main focus is crepes, La Creme also offers everything from yogurt bowls to smoothies to coffee to boba to macaroons to pastries and EVEN MORE!!

"My wife and I stopped here for lunch following a trip to Chriskindlemart.

We were quickly greeted by the hostess and or waitress Kim came over to us to take our order relatively quickly. She greeted us with a smile in a very friendly manner.

We both ordered the strawberry lemonade which is a great thirst quencher. For appetizers,  we shared the crab dip and brown butter buffalo wings which were delicious.

For meals, my wife had the crab cakes with brussel sprouts and the bacon twice baked potato. She said the crab cakes were very good but said the brussel sprouts,  although extremely tasty and flavorful,  were not fully cooked and were somewhat hard. She also said the twice baked potato filling was very good, but the skin of the potato was very hard and overcooked.

I had the butter garlic strip steak medium well with the broccoli, potato wedges and the stuffed potato.

The steak was served already sliced, and although not a huge problem, not something that I prefer. It was slightly over cooked. To me, medium well it's slightly pink in the center (serving temp around 160*) but it was cooked well done. Also, the menu says roasted garlic and herb butter. I didn't sense any butter on it and it came with quartered garlic on top. The wedges were very tasty and seasoned nicely as was the stuffed potato.

For dessert we had the funnel cake fried Oreo's which was delicious!

The presentation of all the food was exceptional. The cleanliness of the restaurant was superb. There wasn't a time when we didn't see someone cleaning.

Lastly, the food was not very expensive for the portions.

"Small casino compared to other ones I‚Äôve been to (Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods). We stayed for a night in the Center Suite as a mini getaway from home.

They allowed us to check-in early, which was nice, especially since my husband wanted to take my toddler to the pool. Toddler had fun in the pool, but besides that there wasn‚Äôt much to do for the little one.
Ate dinner at one of the restaurants on the casino floor and then spent rest of the evening in the room watching tv (not much option). Ordered room service for breakfast the next day before we went home. There was nothing special about it and coffee had a horrible cleaning supply taste to it. Pretty expensive especially since 18% gratuity was included in the room service bill

For those planning to visit with underaged kids, you will need to be escorted at all times in the casino area even if you are just heading to the restaurant inside.

For those planning to visit with underaged kids, you will need to be escorted at all times in the casino area even if you are just heading to the restaurant inside.

I would probably come again once more just so my toddler could use the pool and I also heard good things about the spa"
"The rooms are very modern and clean. There is a very nice hiking trail across the road sponsored by the hotel. A few things annoyed me. The casino allows smoking on the casino floor.

"Got an awesome deal from Groupon for 1 night. We arrived at 6pm, free valet, were quickly checked in, and down enjoying the pool by 7pm where we wound down with a drink and a swim.

Few complaints: the parking. Your options are valet and waiting or self-parking outside the casino and making the trek up to your room. It is a bit slow moving process if you choose valet.

"After a few years of renting boats from a local competitor that always had issues (non existent bimini, broken gas gauge, engine that was leaking gas, dirty and old boats, etc), i decided to try a new rental place.

I rented the 18 foot 150hp Bowrider.  There were no massive issues like before.  The boat was clean, fast, and fun.  The stereo didn't work but we had a wireless water proof speaker for this anyways.  We rented for 3 days and came back once for a fuel up in between.

The only downside was that we hit an underwater log in the middle of the lake.  They showed me the damage to the skeg and as I had taken a pic of the prop/skeg before the rental, it was undeniable.  Got hit with a $350 charge for repair, but I can't blame Yankee as this is part of the risk of boating.

"I stayed here for the NENA conference last year, and I'd heard only negative things about the hotel.  I'm happy to say they were wrong!

The hotel underwent a renovation at some point in the last few years so the rooms are more modern.  From what my co-worker said it ""used to look like a dump"".  There are some issues with quality of the rooms where it looks like a flipper did them.  An example is the shower doors where they will slide open on their own.  My room as well as my co-worker had this issue.

The pool is very large with a nice bar and a window to order food and drinks from while outside.  There is also a clear walking path to the beach.  There is an inside and outside pool area.  The inside area has a hot tub and a little area for swimming inside (it's connected to the main pool, so if it storms - you'll need to get out).  The inside area is slippery, so watch your footing and DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS RUN.  The main large pool has a walk over bridge and a gazebo where live music was played every day I was there.

If you want food, they have two restaurants that serve dinner (one casual and one fancy), but they are a little pricey.  The fancier option you'll need to make a reservation for as they are small and don't have space for walk ins.

I'm happy to say they were wrong!

The hotel underwent a renovation at some point in the last few years so the rooms are more modern.  From what my co-worker said it ""used to look like a dump"".  There are some issues with quality of the rooms where it looks like a flipper did them.  An example is the shower doors where they will slide open on their own.

"I was so impressed with Perdido Beach Resort at our recent conference. All of the staff went above and beyond to meet our needs and facilitate the conference. Front desk staff,  catering/restaurant staff, maid service staff were all excellent.  My hotel room was beautiful, clean and comfortable.  The complimentary valet parking was so appreciated upon arrival! The food at all meals was wonderful.  The lobby, with live music in the evenings, was such a pleasure.
Looking forward to returning.
One suggestion I would make is to get rid of the plastic table attached to the balcony railing in the ocean-front rooms. It obscures the view - not so much when you're standing in the doorway, but when you're seated in the room, it really blocks the view. And, while I see the benefit of the bar-height stools on the balcony, for enhanced viewing while on the balcony, they are very uncomfortable after about 5 minutes.  I have a bad back.  I called the desk to request a regular height chair for the balcony, but none were available.  I ended up buying a chair to use on the balcony - left it in the room, as I didn't have room to take it with me.  If you're planning to replace the rest of the balcony chairs with the plastic bar table and bar stool chairs, please reconsider - maybe offer both, or have some regular chairs available, upon request. If you've already committed to installing the balcony bar table, please consider moving it to the edge of the balcony so it doesn't obstruct the view so much from within the room. One small suggestion in a wonderful stay.
There was a very long wait (45 minutes) on the phone to make a reservation. We had to phone in to get the conference rate. Once I reached a reservationist, everything was great.

"Very economical. This sampler I got had 4 different things on it using a big plate. For $3 more, you get a salad and drink. All said and done, about $12 for everything, and it was a ton of food. Service was great. Food was prepared quickly, very friendly people, and attentive to check up on you. Bread sticks (when dining in) are unlimited, and they come hot and fresh, buttered and seasoned with garlic. They are super soft and fluffy. Honestly, I rate their breadsticks above Olive Gardens. They are wonderful. Reasons why I‚Äôm not going with 5 stars, is nothing that this location has control over. It‚Äôs not a complaint of the individual location itself. First issue is, I felt the Alfredo sauce was very bland. I‚Äôve had stuff out of a jar at home that beats it. Secondly, the amount of sauce (all 3 pastas had the same issue) they put on is very little compared to the noodles you get. My feeling is, I can buy a pound of uncooked noodles for $1 at the store. After they absorb the water, you‚Äôve got 2lbs of noodles for $1. Commercially, they buy them much cheaper than that even. Noodles are incredibly cheap. Yet, you‚Äôre not really given enough sauce for them. Since pasta is so cheap, you‚Äôd think they could afford another 50 cents of sauce. The picture makes it look ok because it‚Äôs all on the top. It certainly looks like a decent amount of sauce. But you can‚Äôt see the noodle to sauce ratio. Also, I assume they have a pre-specified ladle size they are told to use. However, mix things up (or eat the top portion), and you‚Äôll quickly find yourself eating plain noodles. Again, I‚Äôm sure this is a corporate thing, and not location specific, but you‚Äôre reading my review because you want an honest review, right? So, I‚Äôm going to tell my experience as it was. Over all, I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars still, as service is good, breadsticks are wonderful, and food was pretty good, aside from the lack of sauce.

"I've eaten there, and now I work there. So I get to see the food ""behind the scenes"". Most, if not all, is homemade in the sense that whoever the cook is, they will cook it their own way with their own ingredients like they would in their own home. So you get to try the same food about 4 to 5 different ways which I think is pretty awesome. The cooks take allergy warnings very seriously. The owners come in pretty much every day to make sure we dont stray off of the path that they made to build this restaurant and its food upon. We have SO many return customers that when they're off work they will hang out with us from open to close. We strive to be extra friendly and helpful! And our MANY return customers can verify.  We have 2 flat screens to watch your sports on or for your child to watch cartoons so you can eat with some peace (lol). Our food is great tasting. Certain waitresses will buy 4 to 5 bowls of homemade cream of crab soup to take home for the night. As an example. So if we trust the food enough to eat it AND buy it in bulk, I'm sure you will love your dinner! Since I started working 1 month ago, I have yet to hear not even one complaint. If I work somewhere that's not all that good, I'm not afraid to say so. So I promise I'm not on here because anyone told me to, or to try to gain more customers etc. I simply rated it because my phone noticed how often I come here and asked me to review it LOL.

"Pretty decent little sandwich shop. They have hoagies, cheesesteaks, burgers, wings, and almost any other American type food. Tonight, I saw they had a great deal on Uber Eats offering buy 1 get one 1 free on select items. I decided to try the classic Philly cheesesteak, which also came with their hand cut fries (you also have the option of substituting chicken for steak).

The cheesesteak was about $12.50 each, which I think is an okay price. Portion size is decent too, not too big nor too small. I will say that there was quite a lot of bread in comparison to the meat, cheese, and vegetables. I believe the bun was too thick. The steak itself was pretty flavorful and had a good texture. They use an adequate amount of cheese. Good amount of mushrooms, and each mushroom is quite big, but they do have a slight canned flavor.

The fries were just okay. Quality probably declined due to them being in the car for delivery. Still, they were not bad, and definitely nice to get fries for free. As usual, I would have wanted a bit more salt or pepper, and they were a bit limp.
