"Best EVER garlic bread!!!!  Literally made my day! Ha! That pesto garlic dipping sauce was divine with that perfectly cooked bread.

Only disappointment was that sweet tea came as tea with sugar packets, which any tea lover knows doesn't dissolve well when tea is cold and... my husband was asked if he wanted parmesan cheese and pepper on his meal but when server came back she said that the parmesan ""hadn't been taken out yet,"" asking if just black pepper was okay?

"Ambience is 10/10 but the food and drinks are extremely overpriced and small portioned. I’ve been twice - once for brunch and once for dinner and had the same experience both times. I expected dinner to maybe have bigger portions. I’d come here for drinks and to take a peak in the garden. I really love the garden but I don’t think the food is worth coming for. I’m a Vanderpump rules super fan so that’s why I came but now that I’ve been twice I can say I tried.

"Trendy restaurant that’s part of the Vanderbilt empire. Come here for the pretty decor and to say that you’ve been here. The food is mediocre, but the photo ops are plentiful. Wear something cute!

Metered street parking (2 hour limit). It’ll be tough to find any free parking close to the restaurant (it’s right in the heart of WeHo). Credit cards accepted. Reservations available and there’s a 90 min limit for the dining experience. Gender neutral restrooms. Outdoor dining available.

Food-wise, everything is overpriced for what it is. The burrata appetizer came with 4 slices of toast and tomatoes, but only a small portion of burrata. I got the lox benedict, which came with four small potatoes, but a surprisingly good amount of salad. The avocado toast was a bit soggy, but it’s a good vegetarian option. We didn’t do drinks because we were recovering from the night before, but note that the sparkling water is ~$12. Service was nice but slow.

"Okay wooooow! I was not expecting this to be what it was. Well, food wise anyhow I was pleasantly surprised. Anything on the West Hollywood strip, I’m expecting to be a tacky, but in the spirit of location, a super fun experience. It is decked out, very Hollywood. I don’t watch whatever show they have, but for those who do and are coming for a visit, I say hit this place. The folks I sat next too at the bar were super excited to be there. In short, good food, drinkable drinks, and beautiful atmosphere.
I’ve only been here once and sat at the bar, so I cannot speak to the full dining experience, but the bar was very mediocre, they have the look but not the talent which made it disappear (or maybe just not the resources to make good drinks). If I ever return I’m drinkin wine. Full menu is available at the bar, it is open seating. Prices are a little high, but your paying for location so forget about it.

THE FOOD: nothing salty, some items may need salt. Low on the crazy flavor scale. Pretty presentation.

Fish and Chips: for the win! Fish was lightly seasoned, cooked to perfection, and the fries were goody good good. Appreciate and liked the tarter sauce and malt!

Burger: basic and boring, but the fries again, good good.

Popcorn Shrimp: for the win!

"We absolutely loved it! I was really surprised about the quality of the foods. I thought it might be mediocre because they probably don't have to worry about getting guests because of the TV show. The food was outstanding and I'm super high maintenance about quality! We came for the happy hour and got 4 different appetizers. Best fries I have ever had with a great dip. The wontons had quite a bit raw tuna and they were also paying attention to the presentation. The taste was really divine and rounded with balsamic reduction, pomegranate and avocado. The shrimp was garnished with mango. They had quite a few people who were serving so you didn't have to wait and they were super friendly,   and everyone was quite attractive.

The only 2 things that could be improved are: 1. They only serve happy hour items in the garden, on 2 tables and then those tables didn't have a server (but one guy was willing to serve us). 2.

"Another great private party/event my company and other vendors throw for our clients involved in Property Management. We rent out the front bar area. This was our 3rd event we held!

"The waitstaff is amazing!! Angela is fantastic! And I'll admit the hand pinched taco was tasty! (Beef with parm)  The house frozen margarita was incredibly sweet. Which I like, but the alcohol is very light. And from here on out, just NO.

The waitstaff and busser is the only reason they got 2 stars!

Do not walk, run!  The salsa was interesting. It was okay and had carrot bits in it. Odd, but I like to try new things. I got the spinach dip. The large. The most disgusting dip I've ever had. It tastes like the cheese was the cheapest they could find and I couldn't tell if the spinach was from a can or a cheap frozen brick. Other than that it was beyond bland. There was an odd taste I've had before but I couldn't even eat 1/8 without the margarita. (And sadly I will gorge on cheese dip.) So, no to the salsa, no to the spinach cheese dip, and the chips are eh. The frozen margarita, was really weak, definitely not worth $6, but sweet if that's how you like it. I do. 😊 The pinched taco... okay, I really enjoyed that! The waitstaff - someone needs to poach them!!! This place doesn't deserve them.

Edit:
The frozen margarita,  I still stand by that it is sweet, but I have more of a buzz than I realized. So the alcohol's just kind of hidden.  I will say I would indulge in another frozen Margarita here.

The ""busser"" I referred to, come to find out, is the manager. Not expected, but he was a hard worker, great personality, friendly, and very welcoming.

I will admit, he said several people commented on the dip saying it tasted weird and took it off no issues or real questions.

I personally don't plan on coming back. But if they were slow and I was bored and wanted to chat with the staff, I would eat a taco and have a margarita. If you live close by, and love to support Mom and Pop places as I do, I say give it a try and leave your experience on here. Maybe I just caught them on a really off day.

"Walked right in and was seated right away. They immediately brought us out chips, salsa and queso. The queso was great and the salsa had a different texture but was good.

The ambiance was very romantic for our wedding anniversary. The server was also very nice and helpful with the menu. I got the fillet 4oz combo with 3 bourbon maple shrimp. I was underwhelmed when I saw how small the steak looked and it was well done not medium. It was also dry and needed a sauce. The shrimp was flavorful and tasty. The sides were good but nothing to rave about. My husband got the cajan spiced pan roasted fillet which was seasoned nicely but was very clean..small portions all around. The au gratin was lukewarm and the mushroom was on top of the steak and not really a side.

The baked potato was delicious and very flavorful, but the strip steak with blue cheese crust was all panko breadcrumbs and very little blue cheese. The steak was also a bit tough for the $39 price tab.

Service was also very slow. 40 minute wait for a table that never came so I sat at the bar instead and then waited another 10 minutes to have my drink request taken.

"Been a long time since I've been here, but this place is certainly worth treating yourself to for special occasions. Are they pricy? yeah, but if their target is for folks to come here to celebrate anniversaries and good news they fill the role perfectly.

I usually order the exact same thing over and over at restaurants. I'm a little picky and I like what I like.. J Alexanders is a different story. I could order at random and experience some amazing flavors anywhere on the menu. Carrot cake has never sounded appealing to me.. I tried theirs and I'm in love. Cilantro lime shrimp was incredible. Exceptional lasagna.

I would have gone with a bread that wasn't completely dehydrated for the salmon dip but it was really great anyway.

"Servers are all paying attention to you.  Not just one but sometimes 3 per table.  Had fish tacos with macaroni and veggie burger with salad and fries.  Dessert chocolate bunt cake and pumpkin pie.

House made lemonade is sour-ly delicious

Fish tacos are perfectly fried and the sauce they have in the tacos really makes it taste better.

Salad is good, but the fried croutons with it is just yum!

Veggie burger is pretty thick, has flavor but isn't too dry.  The fries are like drugs.  Once you start you can't stop.

Dessert
Chocolate bunt cake is lovely.  Perfectly moist and sweet that it doesn't overpower the vanilla ice cream.  Sweet but not super sweet.  If that makes sense.
Pumpkin pie, is really simply done without added surger.  The pie crust is wonderfully done where you can't tell where it ends and the pumpkin moose begins.

"Homegrown GA: where hospitality meets quality

"Worth the wait. We waited outside for around 20 minutes as it drizzled. The picnic tables were shared by multiple families. The atmosphere was upbeat and friendly. Our names were announced via speaker when our table was ready. Inside is an amazing experience of Atlanta culture, that was a mix between hippie chic and yard hoarder fancy. The coffee was served piping hot so be careful! I mixed with chocolate syrup to make a mocha coffee. We enjoyed a skinny chicken plate that was served with fresh spinach which was absolutely wonderful. I favored the turkey round sausage over the chicken link sausage. My highlights are the grits and home fries which I opted to add the peppers and onions, and the pancake was big enough for the 3 of us to enjoy and tasted like heaven.

The food was great with large portions. Lots of things to choose from. I got the comfy chicken biscuit and it was delicious. They had breakfast all day and brunch while we were there.

"I am obsessed. I stopped in Atlanta for the night while driving through and after looking online for breakfast spots this is what we decided on. I was expecting a classic diner with old guys sitting at a counter giving me weird looks for my tattoos but it ended up being an alternative style diner. There were amazing art pieces for sale, which I definitely bought, and the food was amazing. The waffle tasted like funnel cake which was different but so good.

"I think it's great when a restaurant can make up for a long, initial wait. This particular Lalibela location is ran and owned by a very sweet husband and wife. The establishment was clean and neatly decorated with Ethiopian based art. It was nicely lit for small group/small family style dining. They even have a bar. There were only 2 other dine-in parties seated when our group arrived. They were seated completely separate from each other and by the time we got our meals, we were the only diners there. Our service was kind and they answered any questions that we had. The food was delicious, especially the beef tibs, the shrimp dish, and the curried lentils!

"Really love the concept! Some of the dishes were tasty while others were okay nothing too fancy,
If you are super hungry this type of style restaurant would be best bet as when you get seated you can start eating your food if you see anything you like on the conveyor belt.

We had appetizers and some decent sushi.
Some of the faves were:
Golden Sushi Roll
Tiger Roll
Texan Roll
Spicy Popcorn Roll
Shrimp Avocado Roll
CHEESECAKE

Inari was a little different but not too bold or sweet (neutral)
I gave it 3 stars because:
Cleanliness of the restaurant, it was a little smelly (outside of the raw food), even outside the restaurant.
We weren’t treated as a new customer, we were so lost until we had to flag down a waiter to help us understand and even then, we had to read over the instructions which are on the belt of how to order and how to take off plates on conveyor belt. We did eventually figure it out.
Lastly, their drinks options are very limited-  their tea (green) was not your typical tea it was not great - so we stuck with water.

"***Update 2023***
Food is good. Sad they never brought the banana tempura back. My issue is the rise in price over the years. I remember when the plates were a little over $2 each. Now, its almost $4. The ramen used to be about $5, now it's $10. Ridiculous price for a little bowl! We used to spend around $50, but now our total is $80, for less food! It's just not worth eating here anymore.

I love coming here when I crave sushi. The revolving machine with different sushi is an experience itself.

"Love this place. The sushi 🍣 always tastes fresh AF. You can sit down and immediately start grabbing food off the rotating belt or order off the touch screen above you. If you order food of the touch screen it always arrives quickly, the dishes are consistently very tasty and always presented well. There's only been one dish I didn't like in the ten+ times I've been here... it was the fried squid or calamari dish. It was way over cooked and very rubbery. My favorite dishes are the rainbow and caterpillar rolls. I also really enjoy the hand rolls... They are probably the best deals in my opinion. The desserts are also really good, my favorite is the Fried banana 🍌. A must try if you're a fan of bananas. The fried donuts to me is a little over rated and not very impressive but still 'aight. The cheese cake is yummy and if the mochi wasn't frozen solid as a rock when I tried it I'd probably have enjoyed it more.

"Returned during COVID-19 and had a pleasant experience. Conveyor service is stopped — definitely the right move for everyone’s safety. All plates are made to order, and honestly i think the quality is fresher (you can already tell i loved ordering fresh— see below). The prep time can be longer than just grabbing from the conveyor belt, but for the safety and the freshness, i can take it!!
Menu-wise, i prefer all the belly (toro?) sushi to regular sushi. Their tamago is COLD - didn’t expect that... you should ask for wasabi and soysauce. Udon was decently good - i think better value than miso soup. Oh, i like mackerel as well, but it might be too fishy(?) for some people.

"Exceptional. We started out for Glam Doll Donuts, saw a Mexican bakery (Marissa's) down the street and got distracted. By the time we bought our Mexican pastries, it was lunchtime and Marhaba was across the intersection.

Understand one thing about Marhaba and you will fare much better there: don't expect much from their ""American"" food (looking at you, fried chicken wings). Everything else is very, very good. They do a Mediterranean buffet better than The Marina a few miles north. I didn't think that was possible and here I sit full an so very much corrected.

Things I needed seconds of (some of which I had, some of which I was too full to do again): baklava, catfish, lamb Kafka, tabouleh, gyro meat, meat samosa.

$42 for 2 adults and 2 preschoolers on some mysterious pay per year of the child's age system. So probably somewhere around $15/person with a soda. If the quality of the Mediterranean food wasn't so high, I would have dropped a star for the price.

My son ordered a country fried chicken and forgot to ask the server to keep the gravy; when it came, she asked if everything was ok, and we told her without expecting to return the plate, and she offered to change it.
We will come back for sure."

"Came for the Tuesday deal. Was told it would be 20-30min wait for leagues and parties to end. However, league doesn’t end until 9pm and about 3/4 of the lanes are dedicated to league games. We ended up waiting over and hour to bowl. Our issue is they knew league wouldn’t end until 9 and they gave us a complete unrealistic waiting time. Also multiple lanes (many next to each other) were completely open but they wouldn’t allow anyone to bowl next to league games. This is incredibly frustrating for local patrons who want to take advantage of their weekly deals. So disappointing. Also if you plan to have a night with a lot of people at the bar it would be nice to have more then one bartender to serve drinks took forever to get anything

Great zoo with a very considerable amount of zoo worker and animal interaction which was so enjoyable. There were also several workers (or volunteers) around to help you get a better look at an animal. We rode the train and the carousel and bought all of our tickets online before we went.

"The Denver Zoo is large with many different exhibits and animals. Any animal you want to see can be seen here for the most part.

"Really enjoyed this zoo. It was compact, walkable and had a wide range of species. Staff was friendly, ticket rates were reasonable ($15 for adults).

Located near Denver city park, it’s a short 5 min walk from the interesting musuem of science and nature which is yet another worthwhile attraction in this area. There’s ample parking here if you are renting a car, otherwise it’s pretty accessible via ride-based apps as well.

They have a number of lions and penguins greeting you as you enter and then a plenitude of primates likes orangutans, chimpanzees and gorillas waving at you from their large enclosures. Animals are well looked after here like in other zoos in LA, Oakland and San Diego and have a good amount of space to wander about so let your conscience not bother you for indulging at their price.

"We haven't been here in about a year and so much has changed! It was a great zoo before, but even better now. Plan to spend quite some time there. My daughter and I were just there for two hours and didn't get to see everything! It got too close to closing time lol. Will go earlier next time (went at 230 on a Saturday). The exhibits the animals are staying in are amazing. I was especially impressed with the elephant and giraffe houses. The way the place is set up and designed is awesome. And you can tell the care takers are really great and take loving care of their animals.

Random tips: We took our own water bottles. There are water bottle filling stations throughout the zoo so you don't have to purchase drinks if you don't want to. There is a water spray station for the kiddos if they get too hot. Some of the indoors exhibits are also air conditioned. Lots of places to rest or just observe the animals. I will say parking is tight when it's busy, so if you make a reservation, give yourself plenty of time to find parking. The garage is free and has four levels, elevators take a minute, walk the stairs if you're trying to get to the entrance for a reservation. City Park is also right next to the zoo and has an awesome play ground and places to picnic. Masks are not required, but some guests do wear them. I wore one because I'm high risk and was fine. Can't wait to go back! Hope the avian bird flu passes soon so the birds can come out, but gotta keep all the animals safe ❤️.

"Update: Breakout KC to the Rescue. After sharing the rough experience, Breakout KC stepped up to make sure our group had the quality experience they are known for offering.

"I had so much fun!  Never wanted to do an escape room before, in fact... I was pretty adamant about not wanting to be locked in a room but... I'm hooked!
Breakout KC was a well organized, clean and creatively fun environment.
We went for a birthday surprise and the host rented two rooms; Room 13 and Szechuan Secret.  Our group had Room 13 and happy to say we figured out the puzzles with :46 seconds left.  Great fun, fantastic team work and excellent bonding time with friends!
Can't wait for my next visit!  Stay well and keep up the great work and creativity Breakout KC!

"I went with family - we brought children ages 5, 6, 7 & 10. The kids all enjoyed the experience.

Information: Park in the Crown Plaza and have your parking validated. Plan to spend 1-1.5 hours there. We were there just over an hour and saw everything. We purchased combo Legoland/Sea Life tickets.

Pros: They have a handout for the kids and “punch stations” throughout that encourage kids to read and learn about the animals and exhibits. There is a variety of sea life to look at, some very beautiful exhibits and the information is easy to read and understand - very age appropriate.

Cons: I expected to need to spend more time here, it was actually quite small. One of the punch stations for the kids’ activity was out of order. The entire sea turtle display was closed. The final station had iPads available and about 5/15 of the iPads were on and working.

The kids all enjoyed the experience.

Information: Park in the Crown Plaza and have your parking validated. Plan to spend 1-1.5 hours there. We were there just over an hour and saw everything. We purchased combo Legoland/Sea Life tickets.

Pros: They have a handout for the kids and “punch stations” throughout that encourage kids to read and learn about the animals and exhibits. There is a variety of sea life to look at, some very beautiful exhibits and the information is easy to read and understand - very age appropriate. There is a “touch” station and the kids enjoyed seeing what different creatures felt like.

Cons: I expected to need to spend more time here, it was actually quite small. One of the punch stations for the kids’ activity was out of order. The entire sea turtle display was closed. The final station had iPads available and about 5/15 of the iPads were on and working.

"Came upon this place walking around Coronado Center as I hadn’t been there in a couple of years. What a surprise!

I love arcades, and this one blew my mind. A lot of the games are the Japanese versions which is amazing to find, especially in The Land of Enchantment.

I love claw machines(the more challenging the better), and this place has TONS of them.

I purchased a $40 card and after a few arcade tries I went to try a claw.

After about 10 tries my card ran out of money, and I went to go re-load it. While I was gone, the progress that I had made on the item in the machine was re-set by a worker, which led me to a mini-freakout.

Luckily, he saw me and apologized, opened the machine and placed the item back where it was and let me continue. After about six more tries, I won! The key with the Japanese claw machines is PATIENCE.

Having a large family, attending these establishments is difficult, not affordable, and discouraging when these discounts are misrepresenting the company without clicking farther into the website.

"Firstly, they offer a 10% military discount ask for it at the door. It is a digital Meow Wolf style experience with food, bar and live DJ. The space provides an interactive digital entertainment for the whole family, first date, or friends. It can be very fun but I could imagine with a lot of people it could make for a busy experience with lines or frustration attempting to use an exhibit.
Most exhibits are like playing a VR game such as Beat Saber or a VR style Atari Pong while others are interactive or viewable digital art that continuously changes. A very unique experience. I did not try the food or drinks so I cannot speak to their quality or pricing but the main attraction here is the digital environment. Would definitely check out if in the Albuquerque area.

"My first impression walking up was not good. However, not judging a book by its cover, I came in for a birthday party my 8yr old son was invited to.

"We all love our retro arcade games and this place keeps them in top shape for everyone to come back again and again!

Whether you want to go to the bar with great local/ regional selections and a chill atmosphere, you want to take the kids someplace affordable to play games (not having to worry about the dreaded prize cabinet) or you just want to take time and REALLY work on your pinball or battle game skills...

"My work involves a lot of travel and I’ve been fortunate to visit multiple arcades around the world, including Japan. I’d easily rank the four Free Play locations in the DFW metro area collectively as the best arcades I’ve visited in the United States. In fact, I think the fact they routinely acquire new games and swap out machines on the floor gives them an advantage over the few remaining retro Japanese arcades.

In short, THIS is how you do an arcade right. I hate the term “barcade” but I suppose this is one in the sense they have an impressive bar and kitchen on site. That said, unlike almost every other self-styled barcade I’ve visited, the drinks and food complement the games rather than serve as the primary attraction.

What sets Free Play apart is the diversity and rarity of its games. These feature some true gems on original hardware that go well beyond the dime-a-dozen Pac-Man and Centipede cabs found elsewhere. For example, the Richardson location (at the time of this writing) has an ultra-rare Planet Harriers, an Atomiswave running Dolphin Blue, the first Beast Busters, Do Don Pachi, Power Stone 2, and the original Marvel Vs. Capcom…to name just a few. I’m not really into pinball but there are quite a few of those machines on the floor too.

"So many artifacts from this sunken steamboat! It's a fascinating window into a slice of life in the 1850s. Very cool to see the preservation work continuing.

Once we got in, the museum was great, the staff was helpful, and I liked that we were able to take as many photos as we liked.

I will say that the drinks are a little pricey. For example, I ordered the ""Marathon"" which is the drink named after Nipsey Hustle, which was $15.

"We made a visit to the Trap Museum during a very busy holiday weekend. Juneteenth. The line was wrapped around the building and up through the parking lot. New paragraph. You're going to need to pay to park unless you are going to risk it and park on the street. Parking is about $10.

Once you get in line no one let you know that you can pay for a VIP pass and skip the line for $20. Unless you asked about it you want no. We heard another lady asked about it and she was told that she could go to the front of the line for an additional $20 on top of the $20 he already paid.

It was so hot outside we paid the money. It is rather small, which definitely resemble the trap house, but it has great content and material inside. I thoroughly enjoyed our experience there. Lots of information and good artwork. I was just really love how they pay homage to so many different rapper and artist. The staff was very welcoming and hospitable oh, but the drinks at the bar were pretty high! Very potent, but pretty high LOL B Trap House granny was a highlight she was definitely a character walking through the house with her belt passing falls out and talking crazy.

"Awesome experience! I did the trap museum and the escape room and it was worth the $45. The escape room is highly entertaining. The trap room is informative, you'll learn much about the King and other southern artist. My group spent about 2 hours in the escape room and trap museum. It's not very big but great to take pictures, it's s chill environment.
My only suggestion: change the parking lot. It is a very compact parking space, we weren't sure if we were supposed to park there due to lack of signs and how small it was.

"Fun, Smiles, Joy, Screams, Excitement, Family Fun, Corporate Team Building, Awesomeness is what you get at Frankie's. I came here for my first time for a team members birthday and they LOVED IT! Then I brought my clients here for fun as an exciting REALTOR® who knows and cares for their clients. We absolutely LOVED IT. START by getting a card and load it up. 2. Hit the outside adventures and enjoy mini golf or the racing! Oh, don't forget the Slick Track where you can drift. 3. Back inside let the kids play laser tag? While y'all hit the virtual rollercoaster interactive Dark Ride and laugh the whole way. 4. Hit the arcade where you have something for everyone. From Mario Cart, to competition games, to basketball hoops and the ""Big Drop"" 5. Keep your eyes out for the bumper carts indoors. 6. The bowling is intense with great lanes, shoes and wow music. Sneak to the back to get a drink if you desire. 7. Enjoy more of their food selection around the corner at the cafe. 8.

"This hotel is all hype and no substance. If you like ridiculously tiny overpriced rooms with concrete walls then this place is for you. We walked into an 80 degree room because their AC was on the fritz. Didn’t cool down till late at night. One entire wall is a floor to ceiling window so by noon you have to use the blackout shade to keep the room cool. So then it feels like you’re in a prison cell.
Location is great but otherwise too many cons:
- mandatory valet parking at $46/night.
- weak AC and water pressure
- room is so tiny with barely a closet and no dressers so you have no place to put your things. Barely have a place to walk.
- the blackout curtains don’t work properly and suddenly go up and down on their own.
- hotel is on Wilshire so tons of street noise (windows are not sound proofed)
- construction going on next door
- plumbing is terrible
- gym is tiny in relation to the size of this hotel (as well as their pool).

"I stayed one night at The LINE Hotel on Wilshire to attend the Blackpink concert at Banc of California stadium on Nov. 20. It was a short visit as I flew in from Honolulu on the 20th and arrived at the hotel around 4:30pm. Whoa, a pretty eclectic place ... very industrial, loft-ish style with bare concrete walls and austere furnishings. My room was on the smallish size with a small, but perfectly adequate bathroom, a very small closet and just enough seating for two. The bed faced the floor-to-ceiling wall of glass overlooking Wilshire Boulevard. There is a wall-mounted TV and power shades for privacy.

The concert was at 8pm and I arranged a ride at 5:30pm so I went to the bar for a drink. It's a nice space but there was a limited selection of gins so I ordered a Hendricks gin and tonic. A perfectly fine drink, albeit at a price. As this is a review of the hotel, I'll omit anything related to the concert.

I returned at midnight and wanted to find a place to have some drinks and dinner but it was too late. So, I had to make do with whatever I had in my duffle bag (cookies) and retired for the night. The bed is comfortable though the noise from the street was somewhat intrusive.

The next morning I went down to the 2nd floor where the Openaire Restaurant is located. It's a bright, airy space with a large bar on one side. I had the LINE breakfast: two eggs, pancakes, chicken sausage and cottage potatoes. The eggs were somewhat underdone but the breakfast was fine; at least for an hour. I spent the remainder of my stay in the bathroom in my room ... something in the breakfast didn't agree with me. I do have a sensitive stomach but the only thing I could think of were the undercooked eggs. Oh well, 2 hours later I felt better and checked out to return to LAX and flew back to Honolulu.

Final thoughts ... I like the hotel and its location but I think at least one of the bars should stay open past 10pm. This is LA, not Honolulu. Would I return? Yes, I would, in spite of my issues with my breakfast.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCd0xxMjJ3RRAB,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+LINE+LA/@34.0838366,-118.7512207,10z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x80c2b882f3483d13:0x976facce17b023cd!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d34.0621465!4d-118.3010175!16s%2Fg%2F1tfzxrm_?hl=en",ChIJEz1I84K4woARzSOwF86sb5c,Hotel,4.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkefT_ySQ0jhacmfUlo46vRwmec-p0KzKtKeZK=w150-h150-k-no-p,A Google Maps review about a Hotel.,"I stayed one night at The LINE Hotel on Wilshire to attend the Blackpink concert at Banc of California stadium on Nov. 20.

"The interior design is really nice, and the big window makes the room to feel more spacious (or the room is actually quite small for the price).

Slippers are provided in the room, and there are many plugs the room for you to charge whatever devices you have.

Nevertheless, the air conditioner is constantly going on and off; it is not only noisy, but it also keeps changing the room temperature from too hot to too cold.

Sound proof is not great - you can hear a lot of noises from the streets at night.

"I would give negative stars if something of that sort was there. I would like to show some  pictures before really describing about the service because this is what a “4-star” hotel in  Los Angeles ,USA  can offer.
Are they mocking on themselves or us?
Because I haven’t  had such a terrible service in my lifetime !!!!!
1)We find this 4-star hotel and see that we need to pay for parking when their website actually shows free parking under amenities.
2)We had a long 9hrs journey and we were relocating so we had lot of stuff as luggage and happen to check in by 10.30pm.We told the front desk that we are really tired and what they offered was a trolley and we had to carry entire luggage ourselves, explanation was “we don’t have anybody” when they are supposed to have somebody for customers “all the time”.RIDICULOUS!!!!Clearly shows LACK OF EMPATHY.
Well we carried our own luggage since we were super tired to find another hotel.
3)We got into room and we see our bath shower is worn off and broken.
4)No kettle which is like a very basic thing to make coffee in morning, we asked and receptionist could tell us there is a cafe which will be opened by 6.30am.Clearly shows RUNNING FROM RESPONSIBILITY
5)Now I didn’t know 4 star hotels started keeping open plastic bucket as waste bins in bathrooms.SERIOUSLY!!!!!
6)And the funniest out of all is they have kept a big basket with snacks chocolates, nuts, water and I was skeptical about it and I just called up to know if they come as complementary. Well it seems it is kept to tempt the people to use it and they will charge for every single thing during checkout .
7)Even 2-star hotels actually have hair dryers, kettle and covered waste bins in bathroom.

I don’t even know what to say .Can’t believe I’m given such a terrible service in a developed country like USA.

"The worst hotel ever. I would rather stay in a best westin that has proper close and double glazed windows than in a hotel room that had zero insulation which made me felt like I was experiencing the LA desert weather as a homeless.
Since the windows don’t even close properly, you can hear everything on the streets at all time. I could not fall asleep at ease and was shivering every night while I was there.
The hotel is also not hygienic as a self-proclaimed 4-star hotel.
It also charges resort fees. Was there a beach with towel service I missed?

"Very hipster/modern vibe to the entire hotel including the common and private areas. The rooms have concrete walls and automatic open/close blackout and sheer Roman blinds to manage the light from the massive full wall window which is essential if u have a view of the Hollywood sign which I did in my King room.

The room was also fit for tech and the inputs for the tv were located in a panel on the top of the desk. I was able to connect my PlayStation 5 and my laptop easily to display on the TV.

The staff was helpful and helped me thru getting my business trip authorization forms to properly charge my business card and holding my bags for me until checkin as the room took a while to be ready for checkin.

Lots of interesting things to do daily from the happy hours at the hotel bar to an array of bars nearby that cater to hotel guests including a speakeasy(if ur adventurous enuf to find it)

There is a rooftop restaurant that is in a greenhouse near the pool. The food is on par price wise with hotel restaurants. This was scenic during sunrises.

The rooms have concrete walls and automatic open/close blackout and sheer Roman blinds to manage the light from the massive full wall window which is essential if u have a view of the Hollywood sign which I did in my King room.

The room was also fit for tech and the inputs for the tv were located in a panel on the top of the desk. I was able to connect my PlayStation 5 and my laptop easily to display on the TV.

The staff was helpful and helped me thru getting my business trip authorization forms to properly charge my business card and holding my bags for me until checkin as the room took a while to be ready for checkin.

Lots of interesting things to do daily from the happy hours at the hotel bar to an array of bars nearby that cater to hotel guests including a speakeasy(if ur adventurous enuf to find it)

There is a rooftop restaurant that is in a greenhouse near the pool. The food is on par price wise with hotel restaurants. This was scenic during sunrises.

"Nice hotel. Enjoyed our stay. Good if you want to be in k-town. Although as it pitched itself as this new cool trendy hotel its lacking a few things:
1. the latest style of watching TV. No on demand or netflix etc. The connections to attach you device didn't work and didn't have the ability to connect latest Android devices.
2. Noise insulation from outside and noise between rooms. We were women in the middle of the night by noisy neighbours 2 nights. And the Windows are really thin and let on noise and drafts.
3. Service although friendly in general wasn't up to the standard of say a hotel like The Ace.

"Better then some hotels but could be better overall.
Checked in easily. But the key card stopped working when we left the room the first time and had to come back twice to get a replacement.
We weren't told to keep our phones away from the card until the third replacement.
We left for 3 hours and turned the AC down while gone.  Came back and the room was so hot we almost threw up packing up our stuff.
They then gave us a different room after we had to carry everything which took us 2 trips the first time down to the lobby back to the 5th floor. They did give us free breakfast for the inconvenience but would of been nice if they could of met us on the floor instead of 2 trips down to get the room and 1 trip with the luggage cart up.
Breakfast was so so half of the buffet was kinda cold. Wouldn't pay for it so for a free breakfast it's decent.

The hotel smelled like weed. Every part of it. It also smelled of cigarette smoke. We had a non-smoking room and there were cigarette ashes in the nightstand drawer. The room had just been painted sloppily. There were several things that needed attention and all of the doors were sagging so we had to kind of lift up on them to get them to close. There were water stains in the armoire drawers. The pillows were tiny. We had a suite and there were two televisions and one remote control.

"It was my first time staying at a hostel and I'm glad it was at this location, close to the lake in a nice area. Compared to many a 1-star motel or hotel, it's bare bones in room amenities, but the sense of community and the savings are good reasons to consider staying in one. What comes to mind is a boarding house, which I suppose hostels are akin to, but the staff at this place are helpful and responsive to guest needs and concerns. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and the nice patio area. Our fellow guests were from various places and the ones we met were friendly.

Nearby are many nice restaurants, cafes, businesses, conveniences, and bars. To the east is the North Pond, and further the lake shore. You can walk, run, or bike to your heart's content (convenient for pet owners too as it's very pet friendly in the area). It's less than 15 minutes away from the conservatory and the zoo (both free). There are are wonderful museums both in the area and a little further away (but in stone's throw).

Compared to many a 1-star motel or hotel, it's bare bones in room amenities, but the sense of community and the savings are good reasons to consider staying in one. What comes to mind is a boarding house, which I suppose hostels are akin to, but the staff at this place are helpful and responsive to guest needs and concerns. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and the nice patio area. Our fellow guests were from various places and the ones we met were friendly.

Nearby are many nice restaurants, cafes, businesses, conveniences, and bars. To the east is the North Pond, and further the lake shore. You can walk, run, or bike to your heart's content (convenient for pet owners too as it's very pet friendly in the area). It's less than 15 minutes away from the conservatory and the zoo (both free). There are are wonderful museums both in the area and a little further away (but in stone's throw).

"*stayed here in August*

First time staying at a hostel and I was a bit disappointed. The room was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, it was for three people and it got a bit cramped. It was the private one and almost costed $400.

The parking was a big issue for us since we didn’t get a chance to pay for the parking at the hostel. Eventually we found a lot to park in a few minutes away.

The bathrooms were okay, they were clean which was nice.

My sister got the breakfast and did not enjoy it.

"A hidden gem!!! Clean rooms, theater room, giant kitchen, game room. I stayed 3 days my tab was $47. I stayed in a 12 bed dorm room that was only occupied by 5 people.

Hidden treasure just 2 km south of Onanole and within a few minutes you are in Riding Mountain National Park.  Uniquely decorated Bed and Breakfast - lots of interesting antiques in this house.  They have 11 rooms available for rent.  Very reasonable rates for the area.  The hot breakfasts we had were well prepared - the hostess would offer different choices and took into account allergies or preferences.  We enjoyed the cheese omelette.  Nice selection of teas.  The hostess offered a cheese platter as well - extra cost - for an evening snack or appetizer.  Fresh ingredients.  The bed was very comfortable.  Some rooms have the west facing view for great sunset views.  Clean bathroom.  There are no TVs in the individual rooms - not a problem - just be conscious of this.

"One of our rooms was supposed to have a full over queen bunk but it was full over full...made it kinda inconvenient. But we had lots of couch space for people to sleep. We had a 4 bedroom condo and a 2 bedroom hospitality suite but only got 10 water park passes...they tried only giving me 8. It should have been 12 (2 per room...6x2=12) we had to buy 6 additional. No frying pans in the hospitality suite...we were done cooking breakfast by the time they brought us some. No extra toiletries, not enough for 17 people between the 5 units. Water park closed down a few times but we brought enough games to keep ourselves busy. We REALLY appreciated that they kept on top of keeping kids out of the hot tub! Fun arcade, friendly desk staff.

"Wonderful dog friendly rooms with hard to find water view balconies! We stayed in the more recently built building that is further from the outdoor pool. Clean, comfortable, spacious. The room does not provide seating (chairs, benches) inside the room other than the bed. However 2 patio chairs and small side table can be found on balcony. Quiet, relaxing, with an incredible television. Large king size bed was extremely easy to snuggle in and get awesome sleep. Water park passes (located in the other resort building) were included with our room price, but we did not have a need for those. There is no price adjustment if you do not need or use water park passes.  Also be aware: the water views are most definitely disappointing due to the building structures built between the hotel and the lake, obstructing the quality of the vacationer's view (and the roof air conditioning units constantly running in front of our rooms) but we adjusted.  Just not your standard open air, full Lakeshore experience we look for when vacationing by water. Certainly a top notch dog friendly stop when in the area!

"Family of 4 ~ kids age 7 and 3.
Stayed 3 nights over the Fourth of July 2022.
Rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly and laidback.
We spent most of the time at the outdoor pool/water park. I was able to keep an eye on my 7 year old as he went down the huge slides and played water basketball. He was able to play freely and had a great time. Kids under 48 inches are not allowed on the big slides. There is an area that has a smaller slide that kids of all ages can use and it was a big hit.
We didn’t explore the indoor water park much because the weather was so nice. However periodically there would be a 30 min break for the lifeguards and the swimmers outside. By the last day we learned the breaks were not at the same time.
Also,  adult beverages were available and prices were reasonable.  Despite a bar on site it was still family friendly.
The rule of No outside food or drinks was not enforced. Lots of families brought their own snacks and drinks down to the pool. Which I think worked out because the food concessions was overwhelmed and understaffed. The resort appeared to be understaffed in general - likely true for many places in the area right now. But like I said everyone was friendly, and pretty chill.
Lifeguards did not enforce much either and at times arguably may have been a sleep. Life jackets are allowed, and I would highly encourage them for kids who cannot swim well. My 3 year old wore a puddle jumper and it was perfect. Nearby restaurants were amazing and had a great time at Arnold’s park.

"We arrived late at night, so we didn't inspect the room very well before crawling in bed and falling asleep. When we woke up, I could see oily fingerprints on the headboard, something sneezed or splashed onto the TV, someone's grocery store card they accidentally left behind, and some rather dirty looking blood stains on one of the pillow cases.

The tiles and grout near the tub were a bit in disrepair, but overall things appeared tolerably clean and satisfactory unless you looked closely. I feel like the cleaning job is one of the biggest customer services a hotel can offer, because you don't want to feel like you're constantly touching other people's left behind germs, lube residue, etc. It was a major detraction.

The breakfast was okay but the lady behind the counter (responsible for cooking the eggs and everything) seemed spread very thin in her duties.

I would count this as a great quality medium-priced Hotel.  They had a great entryway and the elevator has a security code so the guests are safe.  They have a great atrium with a pool and a hot tub which is open until late including an adult swim from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. They have a full breakfast bar in the morning until 10:30 which is nice.  The rooms are modern and well-stocked with coffee maker and frigerator.  All of this was only $96 for the night.

"We were able to book this fun hotel during an “off week”. We spent 2/5 days without leaving. They truly offer everything.

Not long after we checked in, they sent us 2 free app coupons & a bottle of champagne with a thoughtful note for our anniversary.

Our king room was clean & spacious. The bed was SO fluffy, which I loved. We had a partial ocean view which was nice bc that wasn’t what I booked. Most reviews say rooms are outdated, I guess they kind of are but it’s not terrible. Every day we walked past rooms being cleaned, like furniture flipped over & scrubbing. (I’m sure it’s easier for them to do in down time.) I was seriously impressed. The room had complementary water & coffee, a fridge, iron, hair dryer..etc Our only inconvenience was no microwave for leftovers.

All of the staff was so welcoming and kind! Someone said they were short handed, like everywhere, but we didn’t really notice until our last day when a lot more people started coming in. Even then, it wasn’t a problem for us.

The Spa! I wish we would’ve thought to book services sooner. It’s pricey but worth it!

The pools are nice & grounds well manicured. Pools close at 9 which was disappointing. We wanted to use the hot tub at night but couldn’t seem to get there before then.

The walk to the beach is easy with a nice path. We took advantage of the lifeguards umbrella & chair rentals. I believe it was $40 a day. The beach was a little crowded the 2 days we were able to go. I just thought, I couldn’t imagine how busy it would be in the summer.

We spent 2/5 days without leaving. They truly offer everything.

Not long after we checked in, they sent us 2 free app coupons & a bottle of champagne with a thoughtful note for our anniversary.

Our king room was clean & spacious. The bed was SO fluffy, which I loved. We had a partial ocean view which was nice bc that wasn’t what I booked. Most reviews say rooms are outdated, I guess they kind of are but it’s not terrible. Every day we walked past rooms being cleaned, like furniture flipped over & scrubbing. (I’m sure it’s easier for them to do in down time.) I was seriously impressed. The room had complementary water & coffee, a fridge, iron, hair dryer..etc Our only inconvenience was no microwave for leftovers.

All of the staff was so welcoming and kind! Someone said they were short handed, like everywhere, but we didn’t really notice until our last day when a lot more people started coming in. Even then, it wasn’t a problem for us.

The Spa! I wish we would’ve thought to book services sooner. It’s pricey but worth it!

The pools are nice & grounds well manicured. Pools close at 9 which was disappointing. We wanted to use the hot tub at night but couldn’t seem to get there before then.

The walk to the beach is easy with a nice path. We took advantage of the lifeguards umbrella & chair rentals. I believe it was $40 a day. The beach was a little crowded the 2 days we were able to go. I just thought, I couldn’t imagine how busy it would be in the summer.

Last, find the breakfast buffet! They have everything. It was wild. Lol

"This is our first time staying at this location. I hope to give some thorough information as I read many mixed reviews before staying here ....
The hotel itself is slightly outdated. This can be seen on many reviews. Now, even though it is outdated, it is still VERY well kept overall. The rooms were very clean, the food areas were great and the common areas inside the hotel were beautiful. The pool areas did need attention. There were frequently plastic cups floating in one of the pools. A waterfall feature of the pool was not in use anymore and instead had many trash pieces and was starting to grow fungus looking things.
The restaurants were very yummy and service there was great. Drinks were tasty and priced well.
The biggest frustration of the hotel was the communication and activity calendar. They hand you an activity calendar and I spent much time preparing my kids for the great activities. However, most workers didn't know what was going on, some events didn't even occur. Kids crafts were free one day and then the next they were $17 to paint a canvas and make a pinwheel. The movie stated on the calendar was not the movie playing one night. It was just sad to see so many great events planned but yet, no communication and no great follow through.
Overall, I would definitely stay at this hotel many times again. I do hope that somehow they can get better communication between the workers and the events calendar.

"We came to Hilton Head Island for Memorial Day because we never get away for the holidays. It was such a pleasurable experience. The resort was not very busy for being a holiday weekend. There was lots of activities and there is immediate beach access.

The rooms were a little humid even with the air conditioning at 65 which made for some sticky night sleeps but still very cold for the hot weather we experienced.

The food at View 32 was excellent. We highly recommend the Grilled Cheese BLT Panini! I wish they still had the lobster roll from a few years ago when we visited but I was able to find that at a nearby local restaurant. The servers we had were also amazing!

I also had delightful experiences with Clive from the Front Desk and Madison from Guest Services. They had exceptional customer service skills which is the reason I choose Marriott!

"You pick the Westin for location location location. They are right on the beach and many of their rooms face the ocean with small porches. Some (like ours) are on the ocean, which was a great choice.

Beach access is really convenient. So convenient in fact we didn't use the pool once. The beach might be one of the best I've seen, easily beating Maui, HI. Make sure to take advantage of the chair / umbrella rental service with beach patrol. They don't ask for tips or have a tip jar, but I encourage you to tip generously. They are fantastic and work extremely hard.

The service at the hotel was extremely responsive and friendly, although the front desk was often overwhelmed with lack of concierge support, so I'd STRONGLY encourage you to submit any service requests through the Bonvoy (Marriott loyalty) app. They even found an item I left in the room last checkout, and held it for me. That rarely happens and is a sign of great training.

We used the on-property restaurant for apps and drinks, but it wasn't our thing. If you're a Applebee's or Chili's fan you will probably enjoy it, albeit they do charge resort prices. If you're a fan of Chefs that use seasonal ingredients, win notable awards, and obsess about details, you may not enjoy it.

The property was very clean, the service was extremely friendly, but the rooms themselves are really showing their age as are the furnishings. Worn furniture with slight staining and spotting is expected when staying here. To be clear, we did our best not to track sand in our room, but when we did, it would magically disappear when housekeeping tidying up the room. They were very thorough, even cleaning our windows when they got too much ocean salt on them. Well done!

The pool was always chaotic and guests reserve chairs early in the morning and don't come back until much later. There supposedly is a rule that doesn't allow this but it wasn't enforced.

"The hotel is not cleaning rooms. They claim that it's to address covid that they aren't doing any room cleaning during stays. But our room was still dirty even when we first checked in!

"We attended a marriage retreat here in February. The weather was a little on the cold side but it was beautiful. The pools are beautiful and the whole courtyard leading up to the ocean are amazing.

"Overall the hotel was nice. The front desk staff was very helpful and accommodated all of our needs. The views were amazing. The rooms were spacious and clean. Where our visit fell VERY short was our dining experience. The first restaurant we went to told us there was a 55 minute wait, even though more than half of the restaurant was empty. They told us to try the outside area so we wnt out there only to be told ""we have nothing to offer you"" even though they had empty seats as well. We went back inside and the bartender told us we could sit at a hightop table in the bar. It did take us about
30 minutes to get any service at all but we definitely didn't need to wait 55 minutes. The server was nice and the apps were very good especially the Mason jar appetizer. The mains were okay. My crab and shrimp fettuccine was SMOTHERED in sauce almost making it inedible. My husband's burger was overdone but it was still good. The one thing that was a hit was my son's NY strip and fries..that was delicious and cooked and seasoned perfectly.....the drinks were very good too!

"This was our second stay at the property, so we had expectations that it would match our previous one. That was not the case at all.

Our room was somewhat clean on arrival even though there were sunflower seed shells scattered at the entrance that remained during our stay even with multiple housekeeping visits. On our first morning, we noticed that we had not been given washcloths. Instead, there was a wet one hanging from the shower rod. Disgusting. I contacted the front desk three times and it took an hour to receive them. That’s a bit extreme. Not to mention they seemed to be surprised/bothered by the request. I know I was by the third call. There was also trash underneath the bed that we were in no way going to retrieve and neither did the housekeeping staff feel it necessary.

What happened next will go in my book of the most disgusting hotel experiences ever. While completing some emails, I noticed there was a weird yellow stain on the partially exposed mattress pad. I didn’t want to think it was what I immediately thought it was, but then I took a whiff. It was unmistakably urine. I immediately called the front desk and asked for the manager after telling them what I found. I received a call about ten minutes later saying that the manager was unavailable and that a supervisor from housekeeping would be up to check out the situation. After the call, I did a little more inspecting and actually lifted the mattress pad. That when I discovered a large urine stain directly on the mattress. Took pictures as well. I called back and informed the front desk, and while they were surprised, communicated no sense of urgency as I demanded to see the manager again to have the mattress replaced. I became tired of waiting and went to the beach for the last few hours that our rented space was available. It was my expectation that the mattress would be replaced by the time I returned. Nope! So, I called again demanding the manager and a fresh mattress. Instead, I was offered to switch rooms, to which I replied, “You want us to pack up the entire room to go to another room with a potential whole different set of problems?” Needless to say, that didn’t sit well. So, I waited some more until about 30 minutes later someone from housekeeping finally showed up to assess the situation. Again, she offered to move us and again I declined and expressly told them to change the mattress and replace the linens. After some huffing and puffing of disbelief by the housekeeping representative, a new mattress finally arrived. Then she proceeded to put the same linens that were on the soiled mattress back on the new mattress to which we had to emphatically correct that behavior, to which also was accompanied by disbelief on her part. The rest of our time in the room we just felt dirty and never really clean. Not to mention a daily vacuuming of a hotel room beachfront would have been a nice touch. Plus, I couldn’t believe that an oceanfront room was smaller than the suite we had on the previous stay, but I digress.

There were a few occasions that we ate in the Carolina Room and while the service was excellent, the space wasn’t maintained well at all. During a breakfast visit, we were seated at a table where it appeared that the remnants of the previous diner’s meal was scattered all over the floor. I’m not sure why the hostess thought that was appropriate and we were hoping that someone would notice and it at least clean up the debris. That didn’t happen. The breakfast buffet was underwhelming and we about got severely burned by the chafing dish containing the grits. The food was edible, but needless to say, we didn’t return for breakfast going forward. Dinner on the other hand was pretty good and we had particularly attentive service.

In the end, we won’t be back and will advise our friends of the same. Perhaps assuming that our expectations would be met based on our previous stay was a mistake.

What an absolutely awful experience. We go to a 10 cent slot machine and end up spinning 3 times. We cashed out after 3 spins just to go and play a little bit in other areas and got $2.50 back. We asked for help because we assumed machine error as we had only spun 3 times. It’s advertised on the machine that it is a 10 cent machine but somehow we had made the first two spins cost 37$ and the 3rd another $22.

"This was my 1st experience, I believe first impressions are lasting impressions..Upon arrival I noticed 3 lines Diamond members, Seven star members and regular guests..I was a regular guest who had a reservation...but if they were ever trying to get me to be a diamond member I would have liked a nice check-in experience and it wasn't pleasant at ALL...they kept looking for Diamond and Star guests first I get it, I am a delta skymiles member and I get priority everything but I have never witnessed delta just ignore other customers who weren't skymiles members they are also accommodated along with priority customers..this was NOT the case at this Casino. The ladies at the front desk kept calling for these priority members while ignoring all the other guests and my daughter said ""We've be standing here for quite some time do you just plan on calling for diamond and seven star members only because people are literally just walking in and you're ignoring us and are we ever getting checked in?""

"Nice Casino. It’s very clean and well lite. Don’t go expecting free alcoholic drinks. It’s not the casino doing it, it’s North Carolina’s alcohol law. Other than that the restaurants towards the back of the gaming floor are great. The staff is exceptionally nice, welcoming, and attentive.

The table games are nice but a little high on the minimum side. Slots are hit or miss in terms of payouts. Word of advice go during the week if you can, otherwise it’s crowded and tables are hard to find.

"Sure everything is nice but it's overpriced. Customer service is either non-existent or slow.  My boyfriend is a senior citizen and I'm obviously disabled. We lugged our own bags through the lobby and down a long hallway.  And that is every time we go...... The girls on the floor with the drinks are pretty good but there aren't enough of them. They run around like a chicken with their head cut off so, it's not their fault that you have to wait a bit for a drink. They need to hire a couple more. My boyfriend got bit by something in the middle of the night in several places. we still had fun so yeah we come back. LOL not sure why we don't look for a another casino I think this one is just so close. Nice bowling alley in the back of the casino and the prices at the bowling alley aren't too bad.

"Our first room the carpet was wet. Changed to another room. The beds were so worn couldn’t hardly stay in bed they were broken down at the edges. Sink didn’t drain, drawers were broken, shower handle wouldn’t stay in place for the temperature control. Changed to another room.  The toilet tank has a large crack. Air conditioner leaked so bad we laid towels down to soak up the water and it was so bad the towels could be wrung out.  Very moldy.  Found a dead cockroach the 3 night.  The morning we checked out a 4 inch cockroach came out from under the sofa. The floor was saturated for about 8 feet.  3 of us have acute sinus infections and sore throats from living in this roach and mold infested room.  The problem is they don’t have other rooms to move you to because of being fully booked. They say they will send maintenance to check the problem but they don’t show up. The place needs a major remodel. The breakfast was meh. They had a hard time keeping up with filling the empty items and rarely wiped off the tables.

"The pros were the location, the view and the walk to the beach. We paid for an oceanfront view, and the view was gorgeous. Breakfast was also great. Most of the staff we interacted with were lovely.

I don’t usually nitpick, but I was paying $400 a night and find some things just not excusable at that price.
They don’t have daily maid service, and you have to go down to get towels/toilet paper and take out your own trash. Again, for the price I was paying, I think daily service would be expected. You can only get a full service every 5 days.
They are dog friendly, which is amazing…but there was no place to take them to the bathroom. The abandoned lot next door was what we opted for, but it was filled with thorny and burred plants. They are not allowed on the beach (city law) so there are really no options. At one point we tried to use a tiny patch of grass outside the fence, but the bartender from the pool told us it was gross to have them within eyesight and we needed to take our dogs off property to use the bathroom.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPZ3BDaU5REAE,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hampton+Inn+%26+Suites+Orange+Beach%2FGulf+Front/@32.7720864,-89.6682116,7z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x889a06f098f471bd:0xe16076cf81f4d0ee!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d30.2681068!4d-87.5892144!16s%2Fg%2F1td61hwc?hl=en",ChIJvXH0mPAGmogR7tD0gc92YOE,Hotel,3.0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPphZYMq3U7e2jgQaBNPdVdxtKvcnMgHqj8Qlx6=w150-h150-k-no-p,A Google Maps review about a Hotel.,"The pros were the location, the view and the walk to the beach.

They are not allowed on the beach (city law) so there are really no options. At one point we tried to use a tiny patch of grass outside the fence, but the bartender from the pool told us it was gross to have them within eyesight and we needed to take our dogs off property to use the bathroom."
The place is perfect for us. Walking distance going to the beach. The room is clean when we coming in but after few days they never clean even we request in the front desk. That's the bad part.

"For nearly $500/night, I was expecting more than the standard hotel however, it was nothing more than average.  The front desk was nice but I had to walk by an overly full garbage can when walking in, so that set the tone. I wouldn’t mind really, but it was that way every day that I was there. The can in the pool area was also overflowing by lunch and never changed until the end of the day.
This place has a smaller than average pool with very little seating. Approx 20 lounge chairs and there was room for many more. There were no umbrellas or tables In the pool area and very little shade.  There is a small bar outside that had some shaded seating. Prices for cocktails was $12+ .  Bring your ant spray, as there was an abundance of ants around the pool.  The breakfast seating area is a decent size but it doesn’t accommodate the amount of people that can stay at that hotel. I know it’s not reasonable to plan for every patron to eat breakfast at the same time however, when it’s 15-20 min wait to make a waffle or wait on some other item to come out so you can have something before they close the doors on you, then it’s a problem.
Our room had a rusted, I mean RUSTED, like throw it away it’s so rusty, lamp.

Room was very clean, gulf view, great AC, and it was quiet. Across the street are a few restaurants, walking distance to Starbucks. Publix and Walmart very close by.

"First of all, the few employees they had working were friendly and helpful but there were not many.   I had to go down to the desk to pick up fresh towels daily and I emptied our trash myself.   It was entirely self catering with no maid service at all.  We were there four days and nobody swept our room or even the hallway.

The room seemed clean but there were small things like the old coffee pods were left in the pots from the former visitors and one bedspread had a nasty looking stain. I took the spread down and asked for a replacement but they did not have any.

On the positive side, the breakfasts were very plentiful and tasty.  We would have liked it if the hotel had kept the coffee available all day like other Hampton Inns do but they did give us coffee packets so we could make it in our room.

We stayed in one of the suites and it was a nice room.  It's getting a little dated but not too bad.   The view from the 9th floor was wonderful.

"💙💜⛱️What a wonderful stay here! Employees are firendly at the front desk and the cleaning team.

Rooms are pretty plain and simple, but that doesnt matter. I cant imagine many people will spend much time in their room, except to sleep.🛌 The hotel🏢 is directly on the beach! 🏖👐🙌👏

A lounge chair rental service w is available for rent at $35 a day. You can walk directly from the hotel to the beach via a wooden  boardwalk w a few stairs. The white sand is so soft and the sound of the waves just took our stress away. ⛱️

Outside pool and hottub also face the beach.

Parking permit for the garage at check in. Easily elevator access frlm the garage too.

Most rooms with balconies facing the ocean are double beds🛌 instead of kings, which could be good for families.

There is an outside tiki bar for drinks and the full beach affect too! 🍸🍷🍹

"We stayed here for several nights. It was our first visit to the Gulf Shores/Orange Beach area. This inn was a nice little place to stay.
The hotel itself is in decent condition with updated modern designs and comfort. The doors going into the room and balcony could have used a little maintenence. The room had a spectacular view of the Gulf and we enjoy the balcony alot. The pool/hottub was clean enough and a had great temps every time. Their beach area was always kept nice and we spent alot of time just enjoying the waves.
The breakfast was always served hot and there was always plenty even though we often ate towards the end of the meal time. They serve you instead of you picking what you want - Covid19 restrictions.
The only reason they are losing a star - we had to ask for everything. Since they are not cleaning the rooms and restocking supplies and clean towels each day, we were left to ask for toilet paper, new paper cups, coffee, etc. Several times it seemed as though they didn't want to get anything for us and that we were imposing on them to ask for a trash bags or whatever. I would suggest having a time frame each morning that the guests could get what they need without ""disturbing"" the front desk staff. Other than that the staff was pleasant.

It was our first visit to the Gulf Shores/Orange Beach area. This inn was a nice little place to stay.
The hotel itself is in decent condition with updated modern designs and comfort. The doors going into the room and balcony could have used a little maintenence. The room had a spectacular view of the Gulf and we enjoy the balcony alot. The pool/hottub was clean enough and a had great temps every time. Their beach area was always kept nice and we spent alot of time just enjoying the waves.
The breakfast was always served hot and there was always plenty even though we often ate towards the end of the meal time. They serve you instead of you picking what you want - Covid19 restrictions.
The only reason they are losing a star - we had to ask for everything. Since they are not cleaning the rooms and restocking supplies and clean towels each day, we were left to ask for toilet paper, new paper cups, coffee, etc. Several times it seemed as though they didn't want to get anything for us and that we were imposing on them to ask for a trash bags or whatever. I would suggest having a time frame each morning that the guests could get what they need without ""disturbing"" the front desk staff. Other than that the staff was pleasant.

Very clean and keep well. There is a parking deck which makes parking somewhat difficult when u have a larger vehicle. We had pizza delivered and the staff offered us plates & napkins.

"I loved this resort up until today. I have visited several times since last year, and have never had 1 problem. My previous visits, the rooms were dated, with a musty, moldy odor. We were on the 7th floor where the toilets were way too small.  They were very low to the floor. But, Crystal Haire, the AWESOME Front Office Supervisor, was very nice and professional. She upgraded both my rooms to the newly renovated rooms, with a perfect beachview! Both my rooms are junior deluxe suits, with two queen beds with pull out lamps on both sides of the bed, one sofa bed, and two junior beds. Each junior bed has their very own tv. The bathroom has the barnyard sliding door, and the rooms are cooling much better than before, as the vent was in the corner, blocked by the curtain, and in an area where is was impossible to cool the room properly. Now there are 2 vents located in a proper area to cool the room properly. Estelle is also very nice, friendly, and personable. She works the food and beverage area. She has a great personality. It goes a long way with me. This is a great resort, in a very nice location. I have 6 of my family members here for the very 1st time. They wanted to the beautiful water. The tides were up, so We couldn't get into the water. The water was barely touching our feet, as so many others. Hilton's beach police/security drove up to us us specifically, and told us that we couldn't allow the water to touch our feet. We were all stunned, because there were so many others doing the exact same thing. Even further into the water. He drove off, and some non-blacks asked what did he say to us, and we told her. This one in particular was saddened! She said look at all these other doing the same, and some are practically swimming, and nothing has been said to them. I actually wanted to leave, and go home. We hadn't been there for 5 minutes when he came up to us. This occurred around 10 a.m., so you'll know who was on duty.  But, I'm yet here with my family.

"From the awesome spa to the food everything was super exoens7ve but well worth every penny!

"The Hilton Sandestin Beach Golf Resort and Spa has my vote. I booked this place because I wanted to be on the beach surrounded by gorgeous views.

The beach is super clean with powdery sand perfect for strolling, building sand castles, playing volleyball, etc. Additionally, jet ski and banana boats are available within a short few paces.

My room was on the fourth floor ocean view so we had the ultimate view.  I really enjoyed it here. I hope the hotel will be updated soon. I work in hospitality and I understand that this industry was very much affected by the pandemic and not mention storms that haven’t helped and it’s slowly getting more people hired and getting the experience staff hired and trying make revenue as well.

My room was on the fourth floor ocean view so we had the ultimate view.  I really enjoyed it here. I hope the hotel will be updated soon. I work in hospitality and I understand that this industry was very much affected by the pandemic and not mention storms that haven’t helped and it’s slowly getting more people hired and getting the experience staff hired and trying make revenue as well.   Keeping guests feeling comfortable and welcomed is always number one.  I will be a repeat guest."
"Well opening the curtains to the ocean couldn't get better, watching the 🌅 sunrise and 🌄 sunset just amazing.

"My family and I enjoyed the brief time we spent here. The amenities were a plus, the views were amazing, and the location was convenient. If you book through a third-party beware.

"This hotel is mismanaged and full of hidden fees. Two of the elevators in the south tower have been out of operation for at least a month. It can take up to 20 minutes to get an elevator and there is a line for the elevator at peak times. McDonald's are managed better. The entrance is so small that we had to sit in line out in the road waiting for the hotel. This is a hazard for guests and a liability for the hotel. I do not understand why this is a Hilton when it I haven't experienced this mismanagement at extended stay. The pool was nice but not very deep. The hot tub was small. The parking was extremely expensive. The food in the hotel is also expensive. There are no proper heaters in the rooms so if it is cold, you will suffer.

"This place was way below our expectations we decided to spend a little more and stay at a known hotel line rather than risking it with an unknown place just to enjoy our weekend away. And we were WRONG, the picture attached of the rusted bathroom equipment was just 1 of many unacceptable issues.

Service: the worse, upon arrival they were very flat not very welcoming this place is huge with different things going on and no one even told me anything I had to figure out where and what everything was. But that’s not even the issue. House keeping is almost impossible to get I’ve never been to a hotel where you have to call a specific number to request it within a restricted time frame. Zero small bathroom/shower supplies. We were charged 40 dollars a night for valet parking and no one even answered the phone when we had a dinner date to get our car so we had to walk to the actual place then wait for the car.

The restaurants and bars mind you that are already over priced have awful service because they are SOOOO understaffed this one poor man was literally running the entire Resturant and bar while getting yelled at. The one pool bar they had, there were like 10-12 people wrapped around in a line just to get one drink by the pool in the hot heat so we said forget it the second time 😩 The first night on arrival when I tried to take a quick rinse/shower  the water stopped draining.

But other than that the room wasn’t dirty the sheets were clean that’s all I gave you guys sadly. And I’m not one to leave reviewed but I HAD to give the next people a heads up.

Also i mentioned it to the manager and she didn’t even offer anything she said “I’ll talk to house keeping “. Most other places would at the very least try to make up for the bad service to protect their standards .. not at all.

If I could do it again I would reserve at the other ocean front hotels. My partner and I checked out the other ones and they actually looked really nice and inviting like they wanted to earn guests.

"Leaves a lot to expect, this has been a worse experience than other Hilton hotels, at first we booked a room on the city side part of the hotel but instead they placed us in a practically subterranean room, which smelt moist and had dead bugs on the bed.

We got moved to a room on the 7th floor which is even more outdated and gross than the first, muggy, and seems to be a remnant of the late 1990s.

"First off.....we decided to stay AFTER spending $300 on a time share tour that we are not going to do because after calling to book it over the last 3 months theres no availability every time we call. So.... Being Diamond members who decided to spend over 400,000 points on our room. We asked to extend our stay when we first got here and was declined. But as Diamond members we are guaranteed a room if requested within 48 hrs. Secondly, in our suite since we arrived the A/C has not worked. It has gotten up to 75-76 and has been set at 64-60 respectively our poor little one is all sweaty during her nap, it took having engineers come to our room 3 times over 2 days without an offer to switch rooms until they fixed it towards the end of our trip. At night it got a little chilly so I asked for 2 more blankets and they were out! So they gave us some bed sheets?!?!The Wi-Fi is absolutely garbage! It cuts out like every 10 minutes, then you have to re-sign in. The beds were absolutely horrible and honestly as a Diamond member it didn't feel much different than a regular member. I will say the employees from the valet to the room engineers/maintenence and in between were kind. But, overall I'm pretty upset about spending over 400,000 points as a Diamond member.

I will update if/when I hear word."

"My family of 6 just finished a 5 night stay, to say we were underwhelmed is an understatement. We happen to be a hardworking blue-collar family, so when paying $629.00 a night for a suite at the Hilton, we were really excited to experience a stay that's above average to our typical Redroof or Days Inn stay. At arrival I was declined a military discount, not absolutely a deal breaker as I was told I was already receiving good deal by the front desk. Of course we were in town for a work conference and were also denied the block rate supposedly due to the fact that we had a suite (the only Accessible room available at the time of our reservation). Next, we arrived in our suite and had to use the restroom after our 16 hours of travel, only to find that housekeeping has definitely not done a very thorough job cleaning the toilet. Ok, fine. I pulled out some Clorox wipes and took care of it myself. At the same time, we noticed the room was excessively hot, so after settling in we called the front desk and notified them that the ac was not working, she said she would send an engineer up to check it out. At 230am when we still hadn't seen the engineer, we went to bed leaving the door open for a breeze to cool the room off. (The ac automatically turns off when the patio door is open, this was not the reason our ac was not working as we had complied with troubleshooting from the front desk) It wasn't until 2 more calls to the front desk and almost 2 days into our stay that the ac was worked on and worked at least enough to make the room bearable. Next up....showers, nothing like stepping out of a nice warm steamy shower to briefly look up when drying off and seeing black mold.......gross. Room service was not an option during our stay, a bit of a bummer as the kids were looking forward experiencing that. On the flip side we ended up dining down in the Don Ricos. It was a bit pricey at $14.00 for a pb&j sandwich with fries for the kids, needless to say there are lots of other options outside the Hilton for food choices and we made that choice for the remainder of our stay. The kid zone was non existent, the kids were really bummed about that as it was one of the reasons we had chosen to stay at the Hilton. The elevators were in a state of broken or in repair a couple times during our stay leading to extra long wait times to get to the lobby. We made our reservation for 6, had a suite for 6, paid the additional fee to have breakfast included but were informed it only included 4 so we didn't dine as a family for breakfast.

The good: At check in the kids were all given a fun craft to do, which they did and thoroughly enjoyed. Our request for extra towels and blankets was met quickly and our interactions with the staff were pleasant. The location was great as it's was very central for the things we needed to do. The beach was fantastic even though access was very limited due to damaged walk ways.  Last but most important, the unobstructed view of the ocean from our suite was fantastic.

Lesson learned, we won't be returning.

UPDATE: I called the number provided by the Hiltons response to my review. I was quickly forwarded to the manager on duty without any prolonged holding. Brooke I think, (I hope that's how her name is spelled) spoke with me for about 20 min as I recounted our stay with them and the reasons for my review. She was open to hearing what I had to say and did not discount or deny the experience we had, which was refreshing!
