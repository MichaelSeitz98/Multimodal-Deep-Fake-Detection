ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNdUxuSGxRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"We are Drivers and visit a few casinos here and there around the country. I thought it was pretty cool.The visual aspect and overall look and design of the place is actually pretty awesome! (You immediately feel like your walking into a top notch establishment). They have a decent number of the front line slots to play, ""Money Cash"" for instance along with alot of the old reel style machines on the lower level (where the table games are at)The Deli was pretty good Salena was great. Definitely a class joint throughout would love to come back again someday."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVNUtfZ2VnEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"RV PARK REVIEW: Not a bad park!  Room between sites and lots of grass around for dogs. Too bad it isn't full hookup.

Also it would be nice if they made a dog park! There's lots of space for one and it would really enhance the park. Almost everyone there had dogs.

Cards to bathrooms wouldn't work."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURReWJLRUNREAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Best RV Park in the area and closest to Chicago. + a Casino.
Check in is easy, You check in at the hotel. The Girls at the front desk are awesome, friendly, and knowledgeable of the area. During our stay RV Sites included free breakfast and $5 off coupons for food at the casino.
The sites are huge, grass everywhere,  and the area is well lit.
Partial hookups; Electric and Water with a nice dump station behind the hotel, easy access and clean.
The Casino has 3 great places to eat and live entertainment on various nights. Slots and Tables. We've had good luck at the slots. Haven't tried the tables.
There is a shuttle that doubles as security to take you to and from the casino.
And here's a cool plus,  evening visits by deer. yep there is a small herd that lives in the area and the wander through most evenings."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ0a1plMmNBEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"I love going to this casino. It's clean, the staff are friendly. And hey winning isn't bad either. The only thing that could be better is if one of the other 2 restaurants upstairs besides the Hops were a little less expensive.
Update 12/11/21: the casino has made the social distancing very comfortable. I actually prefer the machines set up this way - a little more distanced, (not that it's a TON) like they are, it makes it quite nice. About the 2 restaurants I mentioned before, they're both amazing and worth the price and as the casino added, you can use your card to help out. Enjoy!!!"

In Illinois there are no free drinks like Vegas but service if Relatively fast and reasonable for casino. there are also adequate smoking areas to downstairs and two upstairs.

You all are getting 5 stars because I had fun winning $300 on Roulette."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwbWJ1SmhnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,Good hookups and convenient in and out of Interstate.

Some sites under water from recent rains.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXOWFXblRBEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"3 stars because there is not any rewards for someone out of town. The reward gains are small and grow tier points slowly.  They give you rewards but when you live in Central Kentucky and they send them to you in the mail it really doesn't do me any good.  If they could print them for you would be much more enjoyable.  Also, they just got electronic roulette but it's not been operable for all the 2 months it's been there."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBZ3JqcU9REAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,Casino was ok. Buffet looked awesome everything looked fresh and the cooks stayed on top of things that were just sitting. Casino had many slot machines poker tables and at least one black jack table. I wish the gift store actually had something cool for purchase. Plenty of parking and I think they offered a shuttle bus. I did not check out the hotel but the casino is okay.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybHVfSE9nEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Absolutely horrible place to stay!!! We stayed on 4/18/22. The king size bed was like sleeping on cement. Coffee was chalky taste.  Their breakfast bar had to be day old brought!!!! The staff at the hotel acted like we were a nuance. We just checked in and out. Never asked for anything but to checked in, and don't  forget if you take the hand soap it is a 10.00 fee, but ours was empty....lol"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dW9qMWJREAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"We went on a Monday night to celebrate a 21st birthday. We ate at 99 Hops House. All the dishes were really good, I had the chicken panini and it was full of flavor and really delicious. My dining companions had the pot roast sandwich, the burger, the BBQ chicken flatbread and the fish & chips. Everyone said their selection was really good. The service was great, they even brought a happy birthday slice of cheese cake to the guest of honor, we did not order or ask for this, it was a kind gesture from the establishment. Afterwards we went into the casino gaming area and we're happy to see it wasn't crowded on a Monday. This gave us an opportunity to learn different games and we especially had a great time at the craps table. The pit crew were really informative and helpful in learning the game, it was a tremendous experience and a lot of fun! It was a great birthday celebration and the welcoming staff made it feel even more special."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhdk96dmVBEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Our hotel room was rather disgusting.  The carpet is full of stains and the wallpaper is pealing off of the wall in the bathroom.  As you will see in one of my pictures they have a holder in the bathtub for decent size bottles of shampoo, conditioner and soap.  The holder locks which I assume is so that nobody can steal their products.  However, the soap wasn't in the locked container.  I guess that is so that their guests can carry that soap back and forth between the shower and the sink because that was the only soap in the room.  Also, the large bottle for conditioner was completely empty.  It seemed more like a $59.99 room instead of a $159 room.  Very disappointing.  Also, it is quite a long walk outside to get to the casino.  Luckily it was decent weather while we were there."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNTQtU093EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed dining at Legends!! Everything was perfect & delicious!

Being seated in front of the fireplace was truly romantic & an added bonus!! Our waitress was fantastic!! Couldn't have asked for a better dining experience!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJdUxQNlRnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I was very disappointed.  My stay lasted no more than 20 minutes.

When I arrived, the Clerk was disinterested.  I was told to park in the ""school"" parking lot.  What I was NOT told was that someone needed to be there to unlock the gate.  When I pulled up, the lot was locked.  I had to drive around the block to get back into the hotel, to inform the Clerk it was locked, for one of the bellboys to say someone needed to meet me out there to unlock the fence.  I then drove around the block again and was able to get into the parking lot.

Upon entering my hotel room, I was in disbelief.  I understand this is a historic building, but was surprised to find that to them, historic meant outdated, dingy, dirty, and simply un-maintained.

I rented a 2 bedroom suite.  The kitchen was in a room off of 1 bedroom, while the bathroom was in the other bedroom.  So, to use the restroom, you had to enter the other guest's room.  If you wanted to watch TV, you had to go into the bedroom with the kitchen.  The kitchen was outdated.  The kitchen sink did not have handles and was filthy.  The fridge didn't shut unless you slammed it.  I understand now why their website has minimal photos of their rooms.

There is no AC or central air.  The wall heaters were on when I arrived.  I turned them all off.  To cool my room, I opened the windows.  I was on the 4th floor and had no screen on my large windows.   A loose nail was just sitting on my window ledge.  I called down to the front desk and had them bring up 2 fans, which I put in my windows to attempt some form of cool air in my suite.

There were dead flies and bees on the floor, on the heating units, and in the windowsills.  A live grasshopper was on my bed.  Again.  I was on the 4th floor.

The bed in the room with the TV was broken.  When my guest sat on it, I truly thought she was going to flip off the bed as it sank so far down, so quickly.

After maybe 20 minutes total, I could no longer justify the extreme expense of my room ($630 for two nights).  When I went down to the Clerk, I asked for a manager, and she came up quickly.  I briefly explained my concerns and without hesitation, she said she would cancel my room.  While I was pleased with this resolution, it seemed odd that the immediate response was simply to remove me from the hotel rather than find a more acceptable room.  This leads me to believe this is a common occurrence.

Overall, I would give this hotel 0 stars if I could.  I've read other reviews of this hotel and am floored by those who had a pleasant stay."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwOEotWnZ3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Hotel rooms are not great. They have not been updated since the early 1900s. The room my family and I stayed in had 2 bedrooms and a kitchen room that had the sink drains covered with a sign saying "" Do not use sink "". The bedrooms didn't have doors. The only bathroom was very small and was in the room with the two beds. The king bedroom used to have a bathroom but the door was locked with a table pushed up against it. In the entry room there was a big closet room where the king bathroom used to be,  which obviously was not useable. The entry door wouldn't lock. I had to stick a folded up card behind the door lock to make it latch properly. I was worried about a fire in the old building. I made sure I knew where the fire escapes were. One was out of a window in the main hallway that led to the fire escape stairway. Room left a lot of room for improvement.
The gambling hall was old but had some new remodeled bathrooms with gold bars and new tile.
The dining room downstairs was very nice. Newer design features with newer bathrooms too. Could get down to restaurant from the elevator."

Looking at pictures from the other reviews it looks like some of the rooms are well maintained. Our room was not. The restaurant was definitely 4.5 stars, food was amazing, service was timely, and again one of the areas of the hotel that are very well decorated and maintained. I would love to come back and stay in a nice e room! The hotel is centrally located by all the shops and dinning."

Our room had large cracks on the ceiling, it looked like it was going to cave in. Maintenence looked at it and said it was fine, but if dust or anything starts coming out then to call again.The toilet hardly flushed and there was ZERO hot water. I get that it is old, just seems unkempt for how much a room costs."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2Ml9PODlBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,This could be the worst casino buffet I've ever had. They had prime rib but it was limited to one slice at a time and The Carver would only cut it paper thin. But informed me you could come back as often as you like. Not sure it really mattered because the prime rib was so dry and tough.  The food in the trays look like it had been sitting there for days. The vegetables were frozen if not canned. Almost everything was flavorless.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydGNhUzB3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,Today we passed through Deadwood City.  Head to the sliverado Franklin Casino for a buffet.  They have crab legs.  Food tastes average.  But crab legs.  The mussels tasted salty.  Not many food choices.  The price is a little expensive.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOC02T1F3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I was excited to stay at this haunted hotel until I checked into the hotel. The lady at the check-in deck, didn't get her name, was upset and rude when I asked if I could stay in one of the haunted rooms. This is how our convo went:

Her response: ""we don't have any. Because we aren't haunted.""

My response: ""oh that's not what I read online.""

Her response: ""Idk where you read that because this hotel isn't haunted.""

Keep in mind she is saying this as a total Karen.

My response (joking tone): ""weird. Better not tell you the website then (laugh.)""

Her response: ""no you better go ahead and tell me the website so we can get it taken down. Tell me now. What is it?""

Me: ""idk the website""

Her as I walk outside to get my bags from the car: grabs phone to probably look up website.

Overall, I loved the history of the hotel. Its a shame that they added a casino to the old Ball Room. Vintage is what's popular right now. The hotel is owned by the Silverado across the street, maybe keep the slot machines in the Silverado and restore the old Ball Room? People my age would dance and have a good time in the Ball Room to any music. Square Dancing, hip-hop, ect."

Hot water for showers took a while to get (we were on the 4th floor) and then lost pressure during the second person‚Äôs shower.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdVp6VTdnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Ok, the casino is sharp and they give high marks to the restaurant there as it was featured on some tv show but I can't vouch for that. What I can say is the multi millionaire owner is to damn cheap to fix up the hotel part of his casino. Old Detroit apartments are in better condition than this place. The casino is gorgeous... the up stairs is so run down I expected to see vagrants lining the hallway. Must see to appreciate what I'm writing here, so I'll post a few pics. I wish I had taken pics of the hallways, very ghetto. The furniture was old, old, old and the isn't fresh paint anywhere."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZcXN6ek93EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Only went for the Grand Buffet. The food was pretty good, the service was fast, and  the interior was nice and had plenty of seating. I had been to another buffet across town earlier in the week and this one is definitely better. There were lots of options for both hot food and a salad bar. There weren't many options for desert. It loses a star because some of the food had been sitting in the buffet for a while and started to dry out, but this is understandable as it wasn't very crowded on a weekday. I would recommend this if someone is looking for a prime rib buffet in the deadwood area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5cWRmZ0lBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Beautiful and historic hotel and casino located at the end of the strip. There's a wonderful, higher end steak house (Legends) located in the lower level of the hotel."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNGFDS0d3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"This casino is fairly small, not unlike the other casinos in Deadwood. We went because we wanted to get Thanksgiving dinner. The buffet was fairly tasty. It was a little pricey for the quality of the food but considering it was Thanksgiving we wanted to get a traditional meal. They also had other options besides traditional Thanksgiving food which was nice. We were just surprised at how small the casino itself was. It took about 2 hours to be seated at the buffet which is a long time, but considering it was a holiday. Understandable."

Chair is so filthy I refuse to sit in it.
Very disappointed in room.

Restaraunt is good.
Til we took dessert to go.
I asked for a fork, was directed to ask at front desk for one (?).
Did so..the guy at the Front Desk (09/23) laughed says ""Idk WHO directed you to ask me for one (was the waiter) all I can offer you is a Toothbrush or TAMPON"".
I did not Appreciate being Spoken to in that Manner at all.
Better Training for Front Desk Is Seriously Needed."

Our server was very nice and kept us refilled on drinks and the plates cleaned from the table. The food overall was good and there was a nice selection. I loved the Brussels sprouts casserole. We had plenty of good crab through the whole meal. The prime rib was cooked perfectly.
They have a brick oven for the pizza and ironically the pizza on the buffet looked awful. Dried out, burnt and unappetizing.
The tables were arranged in such a way that we were very close to the table next to us which happened to have two people who talked way too loud. They were SO annoying after just a few mins. The waiter even commented on them after they thankfully left.
We tried a couple of desserts and both were good."

If they don't have something to drink that you want,  owners will put it on the shelf, what ever your fancy be.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBbnNMd29BRRAB,A Google Maps review about a golf course.,Looks like a well maintained‚Äã golf course. It has a nice clubhouse and OK RV park for peaple traveling. I'm not a golfer but I stayed at the RV park.  I saw how well they kept up the golf course.  I stayed in the RV park for two months.  They did not seem good at managing the RV park and at times the management didn't know who was even there.  At times they didn't even dump the trash cans. They sometimes went days without doing this and only dumped them oafter they started overflowing. The golf course was well kept but there was lots of weeds around the RV spaces.  Electrical is included but daily space rates seem high for what they have to offer. This was NOT a dog friendly RV park. They have very poor WiFi service.  They had no laundry facilities.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbG8yUzNRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a indoor playground.,"Our first time here,  the kids had a blast.  Typical price for a trampoline park spent $66 for 3 kids.  Love the fact they had a food court here most the ones we been to don't so it was nice to eat and jump.  The pizza was good,  I feel the prices are just a little bit much for the frozen items you get but they weren't bad just reminded me of a easy finger food dinner you pop in the oven.  I wish I would've got his name but this young boy,  longish blonde hair was amazing, his customer service was outstanding and a very respectful little guy (truly a pleasure to interact with him). Also they have a little skate park and will rent out scooters if you'd like which I thought was awesome.   Overall it's a good place and we'll definitely be back."

For the parents, they have coutches set up all throughout the building! You go here and it feels like a family reunion! Everyone knows everyone!  The parkour stuff does get annoying as you're aloud to move the obstacles and small children turn them into slides. The skate park is great. Anyone from complete beginners to professional riders can have fun on it! They have a set of 3 box jumps that are Heavenly, literally best jumps I've ever ridden. Workers ueee are the nicest people I've ever met. 5 stars"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxejZLMGV3EAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"This park pays homage to a lot of great shows that older people and younger have had in their lives. Seeing some of your favorite childhood friends being represented by a roller coaster and/or a giant version of them is amazing.

A lot of the rides are underwhelming but there are a few that really stand above the rest. It's obvious that Spongebob's Rock bottom is really a highlight attraction for the park. With not only the most excitement offered for a ride there and with it's intimate connection to the episode of spongebob it's derived from. Up until my attempt to ride this attraction I was super impressed with the staff's ability to load people on rides and keep everything flowing well. The attendant at the spongebob ride was either very ill or extremely hungover. Every step seeming like an even heavier burden on him. Watching a coaster fly around for a minute and then waiting till just before he needs to open the gate to take long drinks out of a water bottle. And some of the slowest checking for seat belts and safety things being in place I've ever seen. Ironically another concern is his ability to pay attention to what he needs to because he just seemed so out of it.

Paying the minimum amount for a wristband to share with my family to go on a few rides is still 54$. After a day of spending too much money at other stores and trying to end it with some great characters and rides we cherish, we left disappointed.

Still an amazing place."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzdDVEckN3EAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Needs better training for staff.  My 3 and 5 year olds love Adventure Bay and brought them there for the 5+  times since it open.¬† However, I observed something very concerning yesterday that needs to be¬†addressed to the teenage workers.¬†Better training for all staff.

There were still time to play, but some families were leaving. The worker was kind enough to open the exit gate for people to leave, but then at one point, a kid no more than two years old walked towards the gate and he opened it to allow the kid to leave on his own. The staff wasn't paying attention at all to who he was letting out. The parent was busy with her other child who was still inside. As you know, the place gets super busy for parents to keep an eye on every children and she could have done better too, but how does an employee just let a small child leave on their own without an adult!! Right before I was going to address this, (I had two children who were still in the playground to watch as well), the mother finally realized it and ran to her child who was at least 10 yards away thru the gate in a very busy area.¬† When I addressed this with the teenage employee, he seemed very clueless about his action and did not understand the magnitude for his mistake. I get that other families were leaving, but this child was a completely different race, so even that should have at least alerted him that he should not open the gate for a kid that is by himself."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURReHZHYU5BEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,Always fun to visit. We got the 85 point ride card and blew through it in no time. Log Shute was a black. Surprised the swings ride has a higher height requirement than some scary rollercoasters!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzLXJIdmNREAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Three wristbands were purchased for this visit. For the most part this was a very good visit. I've been here multiple times with my kids. Usually, with my two older ones. I did bring the two year old almost three year old this time. We did decide to go on the Dora Azul Train ride pretty basic right.  She met all the requirements for the ride, but I soon realized I may need to accompany her on the ride. I assume the attendant would understand and allow me to ride with my daughter, no that was not the case.
I was told NO!! Unless, I brought a ticket. I said, ""she not going to stay seated she doesn't understand you."" The attendant still say no and started the ride. My daughter stood up the attendant had to get on the mic and tell her to sit down and I said again she doesn't understand you. Can I now get on the ride and he said yes.
I soon realized I may need to go talk to a manager so I can let them know what is going on and get permission for the kids rides as chaperone capacity but was that's not possible. I got frustrated and blurted out that she is on the Spectrum which I wanted to avoid in the first place.
My issue is that if a parent tells someone that a kid needs a chaperone, that parent shouldn't have throw more money to your establishment to keep that kid safe. I'm already spending a fortune at your establishment."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLejRxaU9REAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,We had a a great time. Some rides closed first day but we were able to catch them next day.  They alternate some rides due to covid. Def recommend this time of year... lines were short!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eHV2S3hRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,Always a great time at Nickelodeon. So many different rides to choose from. I suggest so on a weekday cause weekends are always jam packed. They have Toddler Tuesdays and special deals with that. It's better to get points on your tickets instead of wristbands if you don't plan on being there all day and plan on coming another time.

I'd never been to Nickelodeon Universe so didn't know what to expect but it was a definitely a blast. My little guy is 5. There are tons of rides and activities for him (some you can even hop on as chaperone without an upcharge!). The line to the play area was a wait so be prepared but for most of the others the wait isn't too bad. One tip: avoid the Caribou. The staff are not trained to manage a coffee shop and that was the longest wait we had all day for a simple coffee cooler. There's a Starbucks at the opposite end of the park. Just get there before the line gets too long! You will need caffeine to keep up with your littles! Loved the Dora Ferris Wheel, Crazy Car and Bus for the kids. And the Ninja Turtles made an appearance for pictures, at no extra cost! Points band are reasonable and there are many options. Wear comfortable shoes and make sure your phone is charged because 6ou will want lots of pics! Plan for a long day and go get a Auntie Anne's Sweet Almond pretzel with caramel dip for Adulting like a CHAMP."

We were all surprised that they didn't have any in person kiosks open to sell points. The automated kiosks' lines were super long. It would have been nice to have at least double the number of automated kiosks given the demand.

The lines were reasonable, but it did get busy fast. You almost need a few more maps around as there are a number of dead ends. We enjoyed ourselves but left before it got too busy. We will be back again."

We started riding the rides and realized how short the rides really were. Typical ride time was maybe 2 minutes. That felt like a scam when I was giving up 3-6 points per ride out of my 30 dollar 30 pt. Wrist band. Other than that the park was cool. Some of the rides were worth the money and I recommend trying the bigger ones if you aren‚Äôt too scared. I don‚Äôt recommend if you have motion sickness though. I am still sick 2 hours later.

We asked them to clean our room many times and we never ever received it. Trash cans were full of trash and our room smells very bad. Sheets and towels had never changed. The refrigerator was not working and we called the manager and asked for help and he was very rude to us and he said ""we can not clean your room and you have to wait in waiting list"" and if you are not happy, you can leave now üò≥üò≥üò°üò°üò°

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwaEpYMFh3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Thanks for the great stay Hyatt Eden!!  A group of us drove from Winnipeg to Minneapolis to catch a Vikings game. We were concerned this hotel was too far away but it didn‚Äôt turn out to be an issue. It‚Äôs easy enough to drive around the city. Maybe took us half hour to get downtown. The Harley store, Target and Menards are close to the hotel so that was nice.

The rooms are big!! King Bed comfy, shower pressure great and lots of hot water!!!  Pull out sofa.
Could have easily had 4 adts share the king room.

Front staff check in was pleasant. They didn‚Äôt realize we were all traveling together so they ended up placing us on different floors. But that was our fault for not speaking up.
We also didn‚Äôt speak up about having a room away from the elevators. It was annoying to be woken up super early from guests checking out and kids running up and down the hallway etc. By the elevator. Things yah just don‚Äôt think about sometimes.

We would all stay here again!!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1a1ozaDFnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"The hotel was fine, looked nice on the surface but definitely not maintained at all. Our room had a busted divider frame in the seating area as well as a broken closet door mirror. I let the front desk know about it immediately apon us checking into our room, they said they would let maintenance know right away... we stayed 4 days and it was never addressed. The other negative part was the pool, my daughter was only able to swim once due to the extremely over chlorinated water. It was hard to sit in there it was so bad. Her eyes burned for days after swimming in there.

The staff was friendly. The room was clean, it is just sadly starting to get run down from what I can tell."

The room was nice, but needed some tlc. There were a few spots on the ceiling where the plaster was noticeably cracked and bubbled, as well as a large spot where it was missing. The curtain was also a tad stained.

Other than those small issues, everything else the room was in great condition. The room was well-cleaned and both the sofa and bed were comfortable. I generally prefer to stay at this location as it's quieter then staying near the airport. The staff here is also very friendly and accommodating, which is a huge plus for me."

Places like this are hard to find anymore and I really appreciated it. Thanks guys!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdmFxUllnEAE,A Google Maps review about a bar.,"I finally got a chance to check this place out. Most of the barcades are in Charlotte so it's nice to have one close to home. I went on a Thursday night which is ""guys night"" and was welcomed as soon as I walked in, both the owners and the guests were very friendly. For Thursdays, about all games were free (at least for dudes) except for pinball, which were .50 a game. Normally it's $5 a person for unlimited play and pinball is $1.00 a game (ouch to $1.00 pinball!). There were maybe 6 to 12 people rotating in and out while I was there, so not crowded at all. Parking was abundant. It's about a 5 minute walk from Freeman's. Bar can turn cash to quarters or can give you quarters from your bar tab for a 10% surcharge. Bar had food and drinks at fair prices. There are 2 gender neutral restrooms. There are a few TV's playing sports and comic book movies and YouTube videos. Place was open until midnight on a weeknight which was cool. There was one tv hooked up to a Nintendo 64 with a pretty large assortment of games. There were a couple party/board games sitting near a table. There was a fairly large area for outdoor seating as well. I think what made this visit special was how friendly the owners and guests were, felt like you were just visiting old friends instead of strangers.

EDIT: Citycade did a reconfiguration and brought in a racing game, a shooting game, a beer pong game and a couple of pay to win games disguised as games of skill. I believe at this point they've gotten rid of the $5 cover entirely and just made the machines take quarters, which I think was a good move. Pinball is still a buck which is a bummer since there are better options out there for $.50 a game, but it's close to home at least and the price point isn't uncommon. Pinball seems maintained and Citycade has occasionally swapped out for different pins, which is nice. Bathrooms are always clean which is a plus. Only complaint is that sometimes it can get a bit hot in the building."

We were fortunate enough to talk with the Pro to validate ours, but he was very forward that we would not be able to play on a Saturday/holiday again.
2) Good people.
3) Interesting carts (you MUST ride the course). DO NOT get close to the green or the cart will shut down. Not fun. There needs to be a better verbal warning.
4) USE the electronic ordering system as you turn the 15th or 16th hole. The kitchen is slow and even more so if you are hungry."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpaHMzcjZRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a golf club.,"Great course. Awesome layout, very well maintained.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnZ0ktS3NBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a video arcade.,"A great spot to replay the classic arcade games of the 80s like pacman, ms pacman, asteroids, galaga, the simpsons, star wars atari, spy hunter, pinball, digdug, centipede, donkey kong and donkey kong jr (beat my hugh score of 33,300!) along with some shooter games and 2 skeeball lanes.

Staff is friendly.  Beers are delicious and include game tokens.  Most arcade games cost a single token, thank you!  Mexican and Pizza joints nearby and they deliver.  I ordered a turkey grinder with cheesebread for $9.  Yum.  I recommend the Ace Pineapple Cider craft beer."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNHZUR2NREAE,A Google Maps review about a video arcade.,"One of the top video game bars in Dayton, especially now that they switched their games to free to play! Except of course for the pinball and skeet ball machines. But with an impressive beer selection and a pizza shop that delivers to the bar and with friendly, helpful staff this place is definitely among my recommendations. It is just about 3 blocks from downtown, but much like everything else in Dayton it still is quite close to the rest of the bars. The only improvement would be to be in downtown, but overall I certainly recommend a visit!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZeF9PQU1nEAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,Great fun for the family. If you're local you'll want a membership for planetarium discounts. They change up the sky shows every so often. This last show we went to in April was actually boring and I fell asleep but they did the Carolina sky afterwards and it was Great! They actual museum is just the right size. They have manual wheelchairs but my mother didn't feel she needed one she used her walker and it was ok. Although we didn't travel all over it was a good little tour of the facility. My child always has fun here.  If you're strapped for cash every 2nd Tuesday of the month is free after 4pm. Facility closes at 5.  You still have to pay for the show.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpMmRpRV9nRRAB,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,Such a great spot to unwind. The nature trail and the farm is so cute with all the animals. The museum is great as well. Planetarium show is awesome. Well worth a visit!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNGF6NE1REAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,"The planetarium show was fun and informative, the presentation was animated and had great energy. All in all it was a nice experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURveXZQVUVnEAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,"This is a hidden gem for any naturalist. There's an emphasis on taxidermied animals and American Indians. There are some exhibits that have been closed for renovation for over a year, so there is less to see. Planetarium prices are NOT included in regular admission or even membership. The outdoor area is free to the public and has nice trails and historic structures along the way. Few things are interactive so there's not a lot for younger kids, with the exception of the pirate ship and a small puppet area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ0lEU0NREAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,Live animal exhibits were WAY too small for said animals and the care was very dissapointing. As someone who does reptile rehabilitation it was really sad seeing resident animals live in such conditions.  most of the taxidermy pieces in this museum also need to be revived. Most were dry and cracking and alot of the pieces made me laugh because of how unrealistic they looked. Mineral exhibit was pretty cool and the planetarium show was nice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBeXF2YWNBEAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,Super cool museum inside and out. Definitely a great place to take the little ones out for a learning adventure. Lots to see and do.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLa2M3WFJBEAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,"This was our first time visiting and we were more than impressed! My daughter looked it up online and described it as a place with ""cool taxidermy"" and she and her sister were excited so off we went. Maybe we didn't research well, but we were pleasantly surprised by all of the exhibits and especially the live animals. Great time! Looking forward to returning again soon."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaHBfaEZREAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,Took the girls here for a little trip.  Loved the nature exhibits and the dinosaurs.  The planetarium was by far the best of the experience.   Took the nature trail for a picnic to close out the day.  You can go further up past the pond and there is a covered area with tables there if you need a lot of room.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzOU1iNlpnEAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,"This is a great museum!  It's very family and kid friendly.  This is our 2nd visit and last time the room upon entering was a science room with blocks and such.  This time it was a dinosaur exhibit for kids (kid's dinosaur books, some real fossils, discovery stations, etc)  The animal farm is now open but most of the animals were not available (probably due to the cold weather).  The staff there is very friendly and helpful.  We caught a movie at the planetarium and it was very good.   The screen is not the best quality but it was adequate.  When the weather is nice, the nature walk is lovely!  The pond, trails, and streams are beautiful.  Some of the pics I posted are from last year when it was warmer out.  The outdoor play area is great for the kids (again, weather permitting!)  Admission is reasonable but the planetarium shows are extra but still reasonably priced."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxejV6dTBBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,"My son loved it. Lots to looks at. Planetarium, farm, pond, walking trail, special events, live animals. We spent a few hours here. We didnt do the farm but will be back!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbzZDaldnEAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,"This was such a cool place to learn about so many different things. Local history, habitats, and animals beginning in the Prehistoric Era. Informative and well maintained exhibits.

The planetarium show was really interesting to watch about the Artemis Mission.

Outside there is a wonderful shady trail that it a half mile that circles the property. There are really awesome exhibits outside as well as a play area for the kids, a pond, an old mill, a stone age heritage site and a Catawba Indian Village.

There is also a small farm that you can enjoy with live animals. The cost to enter is $3/pp but we ran out of time today.

This museum could be an all day place to take the kids, pack a lunch and sit at one of the inside tables to eat or at one of the many picnic tables outside."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxbDl5MHNRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,"Really enjoyed the dinosaur exhibit. The planetarium show ""The Sky at Night"" was fantastic. The museum requires masks and that was fine. Highly recommend!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwbGUtQ0JREAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,"I stopped to visit the museum while I was in the area. It has many exhibits that are typical of a natural history museum such as dinosaurs, minerals/rocks, eco system displays, birds, bugs, and other animals. It had an American Indian section and a specific North Carolina area which I thought were neat. There were also live animals in some places and I wasnt expecting that. The creepy house and exhibition was very interesting to me because it was based on a real person's experience finding out what was true or false in nature. Overall I would recommend it, some of the areas just seemed small to me or a little older."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bllmRFdREAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,"We have lived in NC for 8 years and I wish we had discovered this place sooner!! This museum is fantastic for all ages.

From the life-size dinosaurs to the tiny creepy crawlers, my kids were engaged and eager to learn at every turn.

We came during a free Duke Energy Tuesday....they offer free admission twice a month and it wasn't crowded at all! I don't think many people know about the discount.

Everyone we saw was properly masked and social distancing wasn't an issue.

I can't wait to come back to check out The Farm and the planetarium!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQweUsyTGdnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,Best museum around Charlotte. Covers all educative for kids.  Very well maintained and most helpful staffs. I only wish it had some eat out place inside to spend more time.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMExPX2hnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,"Fairly busy on a Saturday around 11. This is our second visit here as a family. Cost was around $14. Exhibits hadn't really changed since last year although a few things had closed and the sock skating (additional charge) had moved. It was too cold for us to walk and check out the farm animals outside (additional charge).We had more fun on our first visit, second visit the kids weren't that interested. Small discount if you are a Gastonia resident. We haven't done the planetarium yet (additional charge)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdXYtMk9BEAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,This museum is amazing! So many artifacts to read on.

The dinosaur exhibits were nice, with sounds and short films. The children's hands on vet/archiology clinic was super cool. The pirate ship was fun. We didn't get to do the planetarium because.. let's face it. My 2 year old wouldn't sit through it. They have small live animals to check out too like a possum, snakes, parie dog and turtles. On the back side of the building there's pigs and sheeps. There's a trail with a pond and other things. It's a nice cheap family outting.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCall2b2ZnEAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,"Upon visiting Charlotte, I found myself a bit disappointed with the apparent slim variety in museums. That's why I was so happy to find this quaint little place out in Gastonia.

I'm easy to please. I see a well put together museum of natural history with informative infographics and I'm happy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNMk9Ld1BBEAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,Great little natural history museum. My 5 and 3 y.o loved the museum. They loved the dinosaur exhibit. There is also quite a bit to do outside on the museum grounds. 2-3 hours is good. Very cheap admission.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnaU5fZjJnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,Great natural history museum. Wonderful trail with 18th century farm exhibit and occasional living history demonstrations.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHcXNuSnBnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,"The museum had some really nice exhibits an dinosaurs, and 'Creepy Nature' as well as a good permanent exhibit area.  The 'farm' area was a little disappointing, but that was probably due to it being November.   There were no staff around to answer questions or monitor the area that we could see.
The planetarium was small, but did a neat little show on the night sky.  Some of the non-sky images were blurry, and the show was definitely geared toward a younger audience than my just turned teenager, but we still enjoyed it.  Overall, I think it was well worth the $ and the time to make the stop while we traveled through the area!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNOVlfYTBRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,"My children liked it all but,  I wasn't a fan of the dead animals. We especially liked the planetarium. There's also things to do outside! Family of 6 was 36.00

We had previously been inside and viewed the exhibits. There is a planetarium with a variety of shows that change from week to week. The outdoor areas include a ‚Äúfarm‚Äù with goats , chickens, and alpacas. There is a garden with a wide variety vegetables and fruit growing. The trails lead along a stream and showcase a time from history where technology did not make everything as easy as we have it today. Great outdoor space for the family."

Our 2 & 1/2 yr old is probably a little young to really appreciate the inside, but the outside Farm area they had was fun for him. He enjoyed running around and looking at everything. There is also a trail you can take that leads you next to a stream and also takes you to a area with a big sand box to play in. Affordably priced. Definitely will come back again."

It honestly took the better part of 4 hours. Then the outdoor educational section with live animals. Pigs, goats, chickens, roosters, etc, etc. Even dinosaur fossils to check out. Many many live creatures in tanks as well. Owls, snakes, softshell turtles
And a native American section that's very large in itself. We will definitely not hesitate to come back every time we pass through this area.

The inside is fairly small and you only need about an hour and a half to go through the entire museum. Outside is a walking trail and small animal farm. The planetarium is great! We love to go to all movies that play there. They‚Äôre 30 minutes long and very informative and fun for all ages. Gift shop is currently closed due to Covid. Fun place for all ages and very affordable.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQya3BMczFRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,First time coming back here since I was a kid. Plenty of interesting and cool exhibits. Gem of Gastonia
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRcDVLeHhRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,"The museum was enough for my kids to enjoy. However, if you expect exhibitions about dinosaurs or pre-historic story after seeing the symbolic T-rex, you might be disappointed. Instead, it has solar system and cute animals."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxZ2FIOEJREAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,Been about a year 'since our last visit. The farmstead has been vastly improved. Loved the animals and raised garden beds. The dinosaur exhibit and the live opposum (and other animals) inside the museum were also a big hit. Highly recommend!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdzVqb0NnEAE,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,Great little NC museum.  A huge collection of taxidermied animals and other changing exhibits make this museum a gem in Gastonia.  Be sure to see the Farm and walking trail with native American exhibits.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaXBxRHd3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a natural history museum.,"Nice place with lots of things to look at. Dinosaurs, lots of other animals, history, the planetarium, the farm and nature trail. All that and not very expensive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaWJ6WnFnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a thai restaurant.,"I live directly up the street from this place on Washington Ave and I have got to say that I am absolutely disappointed with their quality of food.  Today, I just recently ordered their Pad Kee Mao and it looked like someone chewed up the meal and spit it right back out into the carry out tray.  The noodles were overly soggy and mushed up like mashed potatoes.  The salad that comes with the Lunch looks as if someone cut out a large chunk from a piece of lettuce, threw it into the tray, and then decided to splash a little sauce on top of it.

I don't normally complain about food and most times I simply ignore the mistakes but I've been living in Bellevue for 3 years now and this incident has happened more than once.  A customer can only be patient so many times and then there comes a point where a enough is enough.  This restaurant will never receive my services ever again.  I don't know if it's the cook or the management but the quality of food is poor.  Years ago the food was much better. I'm not sure what happened between then and now.

If you want a quality restaurant for Thai food, go to Niky's Thai Kitchen.  I promise you, Niky's Thai Kitchen is the better choice.  Their food quality is suburb compared to Thai Tamarind, especially for the price you'll pay for it.

Please observe the images attached for evidence."

Limited parking in front of the restaurant but plenty of street parking nearby. Staff and service were excellent and cordial. Our Spicy Prig khing and Pad Thai were fresh, well-prepared, and visually appealing. I love the spices and asked for a five on their scale of five. It was delicious but not nearly as hot as I expected. Overall a great meal and I'd definitely recommend."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzM3IybVhBEAE,A Google Maps review about a thai restaurant.,"Well, it wasn't anywhere NEAR as good as a few years back but the presentation was decent. Of course the prices went up, lol. An almost 3 star. Almost. Sadly I can NOT recommend  Thai Tamarind any longer since the flavors were incredibly weak and/or bland; so much tasted like it came from a jar and the top of the line ""thai spicy"" was a powder they sprinkled on top of every dish when presenting your level of spicy. Some of the powder hadn't fully dissolved during your meal so you would gets little clumps of it in your mouth. The ""so-called"" Thai Iced Tea I had tasted as if it were a syrup from a bottle. Yech!

Pictured you have the Tom Yum soup, Volcano Chicken and the Thai Style Chicken Noodle. All bland and weak. Not pictured but as an appetizer we had the chicken satay, another huge let down since when eaten with a homemade peanut sauce or cucumber sauce, it is DELICIOUS! The peanut sauce seems to have some type of dairy added to it. Gross.

Seated WAY in the back corner in the last pic you'll see your ""typical American Ken"", who did nothing but complain from he moment he sat down. Entitled as ""F"".
DONT EAT HERE IF YOU DISAPPROVE of the restaurant or its style a**hole!"

The staff was not as attentive as they could have been, but it was not the end of the world.  Having gone a few times, the spice level (1-5) is not super consistent."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlODVHZThBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a thai restaurant.,"SUPERB AUTHENTIC THAI in the Pittsburgh area, a short 15 min drive from downtown.  Cozy restaurant with no-touch menu, short and sweet. It looks a popular spot to locals of many persuasions. Takeout or sit in (I have done both), it‚Äôs simply excellent food. A FOODIE‚ÄôS GEM.

Start with Fresh Rolls and Fried Eggplant, contrasting but complementary textures and sweet tangy sauces that wake up the palate (very much unlike the cliche peanut sauce in the run of mill Thai-style places.

Any of the curry entrees are very good, smooth well-balanced sauces; none of that pungent sugar-loaded curry so common in so-called Thai restaurants in this town.

My recommendation: Duck Curry, very crispy well seasoned perfectly cooked duck atop the smooth Red curry with bell peppers and cherry tomatoes, carefully balanced with two halves of lychee just enough to brighten the palate: Simply Wow!

Pair the curry with any of the Thai stir fry veggies.  I‚Äôm partial to the Hot Basil fry, extra veggies (natural sweetness of the fresh vegetables complemented with their brown sauce).

By the way, enjoy Thai food with a spoon rather than fork/knife. Spoon the curry or veggies on rice, mix, then enjoy. Spoon allows one to taste every drop of the sauce.

Great service!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhMzZXUEhnEAE,A Google Maps review about a thai restaurant.,"We ordered take out, and it was delicious. The trio curry was our favorite, and it includes a lot more than you can find at other restaurants. I found the food to be the perfect amount of spice at level 3 (has a kick but you can still taste all the flavors). Both portions were large which makes up for the mid-range price. I would 100% recommend ordering the curry from here."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodzctaHNnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a thai restaurant.,The place is adorable.  Small staff that was really nice and attentive.

Will definitely go back
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHc2R1dFVnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I had high expectations for this property based on its category and price range. It did not deliver in accordance to its value and how it was advertised. The room I was initially given was not properly cleaned. There were clear signs that the fitted sheet was not laundered. I had to switch rooms, which unfortunately was a downgrade, and there were cleanliness issues in that room as well. The room amenities were lacking, which again is surprising based on category and price. The spa was closed, as well as the hot tub. Those items played a big role in my decision, so I was quite disappointed to find out they were closed. Why didn't the price and category reflect these changes. They are being very misleading, and that's enough to turn me away from Marriott properties. My main concern is they are still advertising as if they have everything together during these times and are charging inflated prices. I am highly upset I did not receive what was expected and now feel like my money put into this property is a major loss. The only thing that was nice is the customer service of the front office staff. The lady taking our breakfast room service order was a little off putting. There was a mistake made with my order. I called to let her know but she seemed upset at me for letting her know their mistake. It was corrected, but her tone was unsettling. The toast was overcooked and stale. Everything else, the omelet, pancakes, chicken sausage, bacon, and potatoes, was made fine. Unfortunately, I will not be returning to this property and do not recommend it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwNTZfOVFBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Would leave a higher rating if it wasn't a 4 star hotel. My room looked out to the rooftop and a tall white wall around its perimeter. Couldn't see anything but the wall and a little sky, and the windows were quite dirty. Not a big deal for a business stay, but if we're paying weekend prices at a 4 Star hotel, it seems sub-par. ($876 incl. taxes for two nights) Needed to go down to the desk at one point on Saturday evening and couldn't find someone to acknowledge me for five minutes. That said, the rooms were kept clean and breakfast service was nice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHanBMYWtnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"It was a very enjoyable stay, it was recently updated with the most modern conveniences there's a new Starbucks restaurant in the facility The breakfast buffet was outstanding.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURncUpMVzdnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"It's a high quality hotel featuring a spa, restaurant, and contemporary rooms.  Reception was friendly and attentive and offered me bottled water and fresh fruit.  The rooms were modern with sliding door showers, a chaise lounge, and a desk.

I'm not particularly fond of hard ceramic hotel room floors as they can be noisy when someone drops something on them (in the middle of the night).  Additionally, I found the bed and pillows to be uncomfortably soft.  I sank down into the bed and could never quite get comfortable.  Maybe I could have slept better on the floor."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRM2RhZnZnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,Newly renovated lobby and rooms.  Love the new layout and renovations.  The rooms are modern and clean.  The floors are laminate so very different from the carpeted floors they had before. I personally liked them but some people prefer carpet.  I wish they had given me slippers to wear in the room as that would have made it more comfortable.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNnN1TWV3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Nice modern hotel with a big pool. Rooms are spacious & clean. Gym had plenty of machines & exercise equipment. Starbucks is also on premises. BEWARE of the bar restaurant for takeout food. Was sitting at bar having a beer, decided to take food to go, was charged a 15% service charge for food to go. I confirmed it the next day a the front desk. The Marriott has no control over this charge it‚Äôs the restaurants policy. See the pic of the receipt."

A few mis steps with the renovation- shower has no trays, glass work area top looks good but an optical mouse doesn‚Äôt work, nice air handler but it made a banging noise every time it started, small sink area barely enough room for a guys toiletries let alone 2 peoples stuff, LOTS of towels was good.  They put me in a handicap room so I don‚Äôt know yet what a standard room is like but this one was probably roomier than standard.  Buffet breakfast was OK but not great - all employees were very nice!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3dHRqTzFRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,The staff was awesome.  We enjoyed our stay.   I believe it was Tina whip was our dining room attendant.  Most helpful and over the top enthusiasm!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURreDYtb1hnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"This place was fantastic! The staff were amazing! The rooms were very nice, but the interior design sucked. Marriott corporate, hire a decorator that has actually stayed in a hotel room!

You have to walk a long way to your rooms. It would be nice if there was another elevator.

The concierge was amazing and went above and beyond, but the lounge was small and there weren't enough food options.

The food at the restaurant in the hotel was really good. The lobby is a great place to meet and they have free flavored water. Plenty of free parking.

For the hospitality alone, I will certainly come back the next time I'm in the area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBaXB6elN3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Potential to be a great hotel, however my stay in room 537 left a lot to be desired. Room wasn't ready when's we arrived after 4 P.M..  Had to get ready for a wedding, so we changed into our finest in a locker room.  Came back after midnight and we were given a room without A/C, just a noisy fan from the front desk to keep cool by. Room was sparsely appointed with no chair for the desk or chair for that matter to relax in.  To tired to request a different room, so we just crashed on the heavenly beds until morning.  Bathroom appeared to be recently refurbished, but otherwise great.  Breakfast was great, but had to wait a half hour to be seated.  Staff was always warm and helpful."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3Mk5tZ0x3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Great place for the money. Staff are nice and accommodating as they were prompt in responding to my special requests. The rooms are redone now and have a more contemporary look. Rooms are big enough and feel good... i didn't like the floors or why they clean them. The floors are laminate and with extra cleaning product it felt slippery and I almost slipped.
Otherwise I like this place and will continue to stay here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dEp1SklBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Modern inside look, great breakfast being 5 stars.  The beds were way too soft and warn.  There was no moisturizer in the room, but mostly clean room.  The bathroom was tight including a smaller than normal toilet. The overnight volume from wedding parties all night long was leaving many guest with little sleep."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaUw3MWtBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I've stayed at a lot of Marriotts because of business trips in the past 10 years. They usually don't fall below a certain standard, but it seems in this case they did.

The rooms were pricey and we had booked a room with 2 queen beds and they gave us a room with a king and a sofa bed. Now you might think of this as an upgrade if you had a couple booking the room, but this was for 3 people and getting a sofa bed when you have paid for a queen. When i mentioned this in the app, they said they would fix it the next day and they did, and they have us the room right next to ours which made for a very easy transfer through the connecting door, which is what raised my review from 1 star to 2.

I suspect they changed our booking because they were having a convention and needed the room but this isn't an acceptable reason.

Other things that bothered me were the cleanliness of the rooms. I attached a couple of photos showing what our floor was like in the first room and the dirt inside the coffee maker. In both rooms, the coffee makers were terrible with one even having hair in it.

Finally it saddens me to see a sad attempt to look progressive with 3 places to charge an electric car. 2 Tesla spots of which 1 was it of order and 1 for non Tesla electric cars.

If you want to add electric car charging to your hotel add 10 spots not have a token amount and not even functional

I think they rely on the event housing so much they don't really care about their amenities is status of their rooms so much. Because every night we were there they had all least 2 events going on.

For the price and the quality, might as well just stay in mystic close to everything. I don't think I will be going back to this specific Marriott."

My fiance and I stayed here to go to see Brantly Gilbert and Dylan Scott which was very convenient being 15 min away. The rooms were very modern and upscale. Very clean, staff was very friendly and offering assistance throughout our stay. They have a buffet breakfast that was better than any hotel I've ever stayed in. It was real fresh food not that processed stale taste. A chef makes omletes with your fillings right in front of you. They have a upscale restaurant called the OCTAGON it is pricey but well worth it. We had ours delivered via room service!! Their filet mignon is to die for. I highly recommend this hotel and I will be staying with them again"

Coffee is typical diner drip brew. Fairly extensive wait on food to come out. Pictured, Monte Cristo with raspberry and the California omelette side of flapjack bigger than your face! 4 stars because I prefer fruit pur√©e over syrup and the service was a bit slow, although friendly enough. Perfect spot for feeding many and leaving full on a budget."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdXJLU2xnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a american restaurant.,Nice little 'Mom and Pop' breakfast and lunch restaurant in Standale. (Plenty of seating but they were a little short staffed to get the tables cleaned fast enough to seat people.) Waitress was polite and attentive and remembered all orders with no problem. Food was delicious. Price was excellent.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeGZfWnNBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a american restaurant.,Good food at a great price. We had the hash and the American specials.  The corned beef hash tasted homemade.  We had the rye toast and the raisin toast.  Both were toasted to perfection.  My husband said the Coffee was excellent.  I'll take his word on that.  I guess I never grew up enough to like coffee.  I'll stick to diet coke or pepsi.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhd2FXSklBEAE,A Google Maps review about a american restaurant.,Ordered coffee and Monte Cristo for breakfast delicious.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvLWRUZ3JRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a american restaurant.,"I love the Peppermill. They have great food with surprising variety at low prices. I had the inside out grilled cheese. It has baby Swiss, cheddar, tomato, red onion, and avocado on parmesan crusted bread. It was amazing. The onion was flavorful and the creamy avocado made the two melted cheeses even better. The parmesan added another layer of crispness to each bite. I upgraded to tater tots instead of chips, and I was surprised at the large portion. My daughter had a pancake and tots. The pancake was huge, so she only managed half, but she did polish off her tots and some of mine. This was my second time there recently. I can't wait to go back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnNHZiai1nRRAB,A Google Maps review about a american restaurant.,The absolute best breakfast around. Huge portions for very reasonable prices. They have breakfast and lunch options. The waitresses are all very friendly and work to help each other out. The pancakes are larger than the plate! Give the sugar bread a try. Yummy hazelnut coffee or hot chocolate covered in whip cream. A must visit. Don't let the wait scare you off on Sunday. It's well worth it.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyanJxbENREAE,A Google Maps review about a amusement centre.,Really nice everything brand new really big but long-term price won‚Äôt work. We definitely will be going to the other trampoline places then to come here because of the prices. Arcade is over priced for what you can win. Which is like that almost everywhere. I do love that they have so many couches and lots of areas for the parents to sit and watch kids. Oh and you have to have non-grip socks and they don‚Äôt tell you that when you come in and they do not have prices for the Sox listed on their board either. They are three dollars a pair of socks and they don‚Äôt have any deals on them like if you buy multiple or a pack or anything to save money which is kind of crazy because if I knew beforehand I could‚Äôve bought some online for way cheaper from somewhere else. I like that you have to wear a electronic wristband that has a green and red light to tell you when your time is up. Everything is very Clean because it is a brand new building and equipment. I just hope it stays that way.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeU1tNm9RRRAB,A Google Maps review about a amusement centre.,"Spent several hours reading my book while my 11 and 14-year-old boys got plenty of exercise. (Adults don‚Äôt have to pay if they don‚Äôt plan on jumping) Many clean and comfortable couches to choose from for parents who want to relax and lots of fun activities for kids of all ages. I saw many small children and big children playing on many different things and it‚Äôs big enough that nobody was getting in each others way. Prices were not as high as expected for how huge and nice the facility is. Of course trampoline parks are pricey regardless but I thought it was worth the money. Will be back.
Side note: I‚Äôve been to several other trampoline parks and they play the best music at Hive by far."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPN1pic1RnEAE,A Google Maps review about a amusement centre.,Really fun place to go. Only things are it is pricy (but everything is now) and they need self cleaning supplies (oh and a changing table‚Ä¶). My kids would live here if they could! Go Karts are fun but not as much when no one else is riding.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNXYyc01BEAE,A Google Maps review about a amusement centre.,"Great place to bring your kids. (especially if you want to wear them out) tons to do...jumping, sliding, climbing, running, etc."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaFpLclNREAE,A Google Maps review about a amusement centre.,The place is big and clean. All equipment is new but nobody monitors the activities. My son was jumping on the valo jump (picture attached) and other kids (I think ages 3-6y) joined them. I asked them to wait for their turns but they kept jumping. No parents around to educate their kids + no hive staff.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybE1ET0lnEAE,A Google Maps review about a amusement centre.,"This place is huge, clean, and impressive! We went in the morning, and it was really fun. My kids got a lot of fun and exercise in, in just an hour! Their favorite activity was the go-karts. They're silent, speedy, & so much nicer than outdoor gas ones. If you're short on time, you could even go here for a quick stop-in and do just the go-karts. We were helped by Chase, who was nice and knowledgeable, and Holland, who was helpful and fun. We were also able to talk with the owners on our way out, who were also very friendly, attentive, and excited about The Hive. Good vibes here! Go check it out!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbXBXc1B3EAE,A Google Maps review about a amusement centre.,"Place has more to offer than those regular ones like airborne.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyc3Azd3NnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a amusement centre.,"Great place, definitely glad to have it near us. Yes it costs more than Hang Time, but it has more to offer. Plus a bunch of couches and several massage chairs for adults.
At Hang Time I'm always worried about where my smaller kids are because you can't keep a good eye everywhere. Feels like it's for older kids and young adults with more trampolines for tricks.

What I like about The Hive it's good for kids of all ages. There's a tetherball with jumping around it. Two interactive video game screens that actually show their picture on screen as they jump, so fun!
Zip line, jumping basketball, targets, go carts (costs extra), the biggest bounce house/obstacle course I've ever seen. Regular trampolines too, rock wall, ninja warrior obstacles, slack line.

There are drinking fountains, but they're by the go carts (kind of annoying they're so far).
They also have bands to wear that have lights that change color when your time is up. They do have lockers as well.
Overall, we'll go again, but less frequently because of the cost. Still, i thought it was worth it, especially for families with kids."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNock5Lbm93RRAB,A Google Maps review about a amusement centre.,"Probably the best trampoline park in the state, at least from what I‚Äôve been too. Very clean, which is the most important. Huge bounce house setup too, even for adults, which is fun. Zip line and video-game type jumps too. Decent pricing. Even Go-Carts for a little bit extra!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOTk3RWlRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a amusement centre.,Best of the best! We go to Family Entertainment businesses around the country and I haven‚Äôt seen a place this quality anywhere else. I‚Äôve seen a few reviews complaining about the price but it‚Äôs well worth it and pricing is more than fair for this premium experience. You really have to go nothing in this review will give this place justice. My kids went for 2 hours and didn‚Äôt want to leave and afterwards they couldn‚Äôt stop talking about it! We can‚Äôt wait to go back !!

Keep this place clean. Free dump and water for RV and large car."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdlpLSWN3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Clean from one end of the complex to the other. Great staff. Comfortable rooms.

Very friendly towards pro drivers - CDL rates for rooms,  plenty of truck parking (you can park a bob tail right by the hotel), separate truck stop at diesel island."

Be sure to get a picture with Emperor."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZdElfemd3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,Lots of parking. 2 stores. 1 for truckers and 1 for cars. Each one has a small fast food restaraunt. Plenty of choices on the menu. Large clean restrooms.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjcUxYcmx3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Two stars because of the tiny bathroom.this tiny bathroom had two doors going into it. One from the bedroom, and one from the front room/bedroom.
The place is adorable! What a throwback to yesteryear! Theplumbing going into the wall in the bathroom was shoddily done. The it was just a hole in the wall without the tile put around it professionally. If you are 5 feet tall then the shower will be perfect for you. Beds were exceedingly hard. Dogs are only $10. Room was $104 which is quite expensive for where it is."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNMWJ5TVZBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"An experience all unto itself, Little America is an historic bit of motoring Americana; a nicely-kept, relaxing hotel, diner, playground, gas station, and gift shop out in the wide-open of Wyoming along Interstate 80.  Stop in and fill up your tank, fill up your stomach, snag a gift or a bit of road trip memorabilia, or check in for a good night's sleep.  The place has been here since 1934, and continues to offer motorists a nice respite from the road.  No, it's not The Ritz, but there is no Ritz within 500 miles, and there's plenty to enjoy right here."

We were told there is a tub. No tub in this room. Bummer. As a trucker, a tub is a luxury."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3ME96b0dBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"50¬¢ ice cream cones, clean bathrooms, hot food, gas and play area! We travel from East coast to West coast and back several times and this remains a great place to stop, either with the kids or without. Open 24-7, it's a great pit stop. The kids love it and don't mind shopping for that odd something you don't find elsewhere in the gift shop. It's strategically placed in the middle of nowhere, but has just what's needed. The lawns are green and it's surrounded by trees. A true desert Oasis."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRb2EyTjdRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Restrooms were acceptable, but not especially clean. Lots of fun shopping, which was nice, since the food took sooooooooo long.

The portions were large, the food was very good and the service was great! It got pretty busy in there when we were leaving and the server although very busy and by himself still provided excellent service and even refilled our drinks. I definitely would recommend this place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRNmZMNDFRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Nice clean truck stop with some pretty good made to order food at the fuel island, 4 wheeler gas station, or at the restaurant.   Have always found truck parking here even at 1 am.

Love the little lounge just to the left of the motel check-in/receptionist area.  Pretty close to a full bar and they sell packaged liquor/beer to go."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrX19maXNBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"My girls loved it and deemed our large double queen room with pink tiled bathroom - a princess room. The beds were comfortable and we had one of our best nights sleep there during our travels. The bathroom fixtures are a bit strange but it just takes a bit of testing to get it right. Overall the hotel was very quiet for us despite the property doubling as a 24 hour truck stop. We were in a very quiet unit (no pets). I've heard others say the other units can be noisier (pets allowed) as they are closer to the trucking amenities. Lastly, there is a playground and fun statues for the kids to get on - the Sinclair dinosaur and a giant buffalo. There is a once live penguin in the check in area. Really cool place with gorgeous Wyoming scenery. Planning a big family trip there again with more relatives! What a find."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eGFlSER3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,I didn't stay at the hotel but I've stopped here several times for a food break and fuel stop. Bathrooms are clean.

Good place to stop.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3MnVLTlVREAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"So happy this place had last minute availability on Labor Day! So pet friendly with $10 upcharge for 2 dogs.

Trucker parking is plentiful and on the other side."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBcE1DckN3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"It's a little oasis in the middle of nowhere.

I hope places like these stay in business for a while.  It's s fun visiting them.  An oasis in the desert, almost literally. Good customer service and great ice cream cones ( especially the prices at $75 a piece)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3OUszNkpBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Very nice little place in the middle of nothing. I mean there is literally nothing around for miles. That being said this is a nice little place that is reasonably priced. We got the deluxe room. They are old fashioned style but well maintained and is basicall like a suite. In a big city you would pay top dollar for a room like this but our rate was close to $100... not bad at all. Definitely recommend if you are traveling and going to pass through here this would be a great place to stop and get some rest...

They hotel grill closes at 10pm which no one told us but if you are really hungry you can head over to the truck travel center, that grill is open 24 hours..."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvbkx6aHZnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,Endless truck parking. Small pet area to let the doggies roam leash free. They also have a nice grill that cooks up quick delicious food at least for a truck stop.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0cnNhc0xBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"We LOVE western Wyoming's Little America! This was the first Little America we ever visited (over two years ago) and it is our favorite by far! (Little America Flagstaff is a close second.) We've never stayed at the hotel, but the travel center is excellent!

The shower rooms are always spotless and so cozy, each having its own huge, glass-doored, tile shower, and a separate soaking tub as an added bonus that we always look forward to. Showers are $12, and they provide mineral bath gel, bars of soap, and plenty of clean, warm towels. We stop solely for the amazing showers, but stick around a little longer for the food.

The grill has exceeded our expectations as far as a travel center food stop goes - the menu is kinda limited, but they have several different choices, from burgers to breakfast to fried chicken. The food is made to order and everything we've had has been so delicious. (My personal favorite is the breakfast burrito with sausage gravy.) The grill is also open 24 hours a day and serving everything on the menu all day long. Sure beats a basic fast food stop at any of the other travel centers!

In our experience, the staff at this location have been very friendly, welcoming, and happy to meet whatever need that arises, round the clock. If you're a trucker, get here early (or super late night) if you hope to find a parking spot. This is the last travel stop for a while if you're eastbound, and the veteran drivers already know how awesome this place is, so the lot fills up quick and there's usually a ton of create-a-spot tetris going on come nightfall.

The Little America experience is never short of amazing for us, and so memorable that every time we leave we can hardly wait until our next visit! Plus, they have a great view from the parking lot. Rolling hills, plateaus, and snow-capped mountains are hard to beat!"

Had the jam eggs hashbrowms and toast for breakfast and it was worse, if that's possible. Got my eggs scrambled with cheese and the cheese ended up on my toast."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzck4yY19RRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Little America is a good option if you need a break from freeway driving. The bathrooms are clean and the convenience store has about anything you need while traveling. The grill has decent options if you want a hot meal. Gas prices here are always inflated so I generally choose to fill up elsewhere. The hotel rooms seem clean, but the decor is very interesting; it reminds me of furniture and decorations my grandma would have had in her house back in the 70s or 80s. The service has always been pretty good. If you ever get caught in one of Wyoming's infamous 1-80 winter storms, Little America can be a refuge."

Great little playground for the kids."

It would sure be great to see souvenirs from America as opposed to China and Pakistan. Give American artists an opportunity to be part of Little America."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3amJPZGpRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"03-19-19 Back for a shower. Maybe a soak in the bathtub. And definitely some home cooking from the kitchen where the big rigs park.

08-7-18  OMG this little kitchen cooks THE best bacon. Hands down. Also the scalloped breakfast potatoes are excellent and with the very good gravy. It's better than home cooked. (Almost) it IS the next best. Good job to the travel center kitchen crew. Oh ya and the pancakes, they are using Krusteaz mix, it never comes out this good for me at home üëçüëç.

05-16-18 This morning bacon fried eggs English muffin and hash browns. I feeling like I'm eating at home, the best.
Hmmm. Deep fried peanuts? Says you can eat em she'll and all.

05-06-18 Chocolate glazed today. And bacon cooked to perfection. French toast.

04-01-18 Have only seen the truck side. Very good kitchen there and travel store. Good prices on deli food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NnBPcUxnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,I've been coming here since I was little to get the 25cent ice cream and browse the gift shop. This is the first time I've stayed. Loved the 3 double beds room.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjbk1tUHJ3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"This is the most amazing place. Free dumping!!!! Free fresh water!!! Everything is reasonably priced!!!The photos u see were taken by where we parked our rv for free! They have everything you need! Restaurant, laundry, post office, gift store, friendly Staff!!! We stayed for three nights and of course contributed $150 in sales from food, gas, and the gift store! Reasonable prices! Best spot! Free rv dumping and fresh water!!!!! I have asked employees for stuff that is a little beyond what is offered and the answer is always yes and with a smile! They have 17 marble showers and lots of washers and dryers with a great room to wait in and watch tv and they have devices in the room to plug in your laptop and charge your phone while u wait. The WiFi could b better."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMFltU2lBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Had to stay here because of my truck broke down. 01/30/22 -01/31/22
Edited:
I haven‚Äôt complained about it right away because I checked in around 2:30am. I was just exhausted. But, I left a long notice on your check out card.

Bedding were covered in some paint and someone‚Äôs hair. Also, the cleaning lady starts knocking doors around at 8:50am despite the check out at 11am and eventually wakes you up!WHY????
Hopefully, won‚Äôt have to stay here again.
And of course nobody will reply. Because there‚Äôs nothing to say, right guys?!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4eHJ5bU9BEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Hotel is extremely outdated and staff needs to brush up on their customer service skills. The property probably hasn't had any sort of renovation since the 90's and it is long overdue. I was offered a package when I checked in which included a discount if I spent $30 in the gift shop/restaurant/gas station. I was told to bring back my receipts and they would apply the discount. The next morning I went into the front desk with my receipts only to be told I needed to turn them in the night before. I told the front desk attendant that I was not informed that it had to be turned in the same day I checked in, only to bring my receipts back and the front desk lady would take off the discount.  The front desk attendant rudely said,  ""yeah her and she's not here"". I then asked for a manager who quickly resolved the problem. If you're going to have a strict policy on how long customers have to turn in receipts for credits on a package I didn't even ask for then you need to inform the customers of that policy. Additionally, having a bad attitude with a customer who was obviously not informed correctly by your staff will not earn you business. I will NEVER stay here again!  Gross, outdated and rude staff!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBaEtQYUFREAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"This place is awesome, and super unexpected in the middle of nowhere. I feel like they could charge whatever they want for their food since they have pretty much no competition, but it was some of the most fairly priced food we've ever had. I had a massive stack of pancakes and was super happy with them. Plus there is lots of room for kids to get their energy out!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvdnFTclF3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Ok, I don‚Äôt like giving less then 5-stars, but between the broken shower head, super slow service & it seemed like everyone was confused/out of it. The food was ok, but between waiting 15 min to order and another 15 for a pancake/bacon, then the condition of the showers (which they were CLEAN! Big difference between clean and something broken, clearly a better cleaning staff then repair staff), I was kinda disappointed after going to another Little America, (AZ I think...)
I will go back though, still got a great sense of safety compared to other truck stops, which makes it super worth it:)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvMzhXNzNnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Really disappointed, I couldn't order anything because I can't justify a 15$ cheese burger or a 100$ hotel room. Especially in Wyoming. Bathroom was fairly dirty and the sinks don't work."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3MXNyV053EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Nicest roach motel I've stayed at.  It looks cute and quaint from a distance, but don't be fooled into booking a room there.  AC was not adequate.  Had to leave the sliding patio door open for air, which was really hard to move because it was off its rollers.  It was also not secure because the patio is shared with every room on that side of the building.  The room was not clean.  There was trash left from the previous occupant: receipt in the dresser, pizza crust under the bed, comb on the bathroom sink, and water in the ice bucket.  There was a brown crusty substance on the edge of the bathroom garbage can.  The bed sheets were too short and because I'm tall my feet were rubbing on the rough protective pad underneath.  Both beds were like that but I was the only one tall enough to notice.  The map of the grounds they gave us was a bad copy and it was hard to read the amenities.  I thought there might be a nicer version in the amenities book in the room but the book had nothing in it at all.  This means we knew nothing about the hotel other than what was on the bad map.  We didn't have any phone numbers to call for service or if it was possible to order food from the restaurant.  We went in the pool, which had several places where it had cracked and was missing chunks of concrete and tiles.  The deep end separation floaters were all destroyed and were held up by the rope.  We avoided several bad sections of the pool due to it's horrible condition.  When we checked out in the morning it was so early (6:15 AM) that we had to check out at the gift shop and the staff there were not pleasant.  This was also where you payed for gas, and it had the restaurant in it.  The restaurant menu was horrible.  I couldn't order anything due to the limited menu.  The payment system was down and they didn't seem to have a manual backup system so we had to wait, delaying our departure."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2NE9mLWZnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,We stopped for the dollar ice cream cones-yummy!! The place is filled with tourists which is fine since this is a road trip stop off. The gift shop was overwhelming-they sell so much stuff. I am not complaining because when I travel I enjoy stopping on the road to stretch and take a break-this is perfect for doing that and since the gift shop is so filled with snacks and souvenirs you‚Äôll be sure to find something for everyone. Or just stop for the ice cream cones-it‚Äôs worth it!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4dk1DY1RnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"This was an awesome place to stop for a break on our cross US roadtrip! I can't wait for the trip back to do some more explaining!. We didn't stay at the hotel, we were just passing through to eat, fill up the tank, stretch our legs and play on the playground!."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHb3V6QXh3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"The suite we were in was beautiful. Like walking into grandmas house. Our sitting room furniture was very comfortable. The whole room was clean and my wife loved having a place to do her makeup.  Beautiful grounds And the hallway wasn‚Äôt dirty. Something I‚Äôve never seen is the refrigerator and microwave Are in the bathroom but they blend with the decor so it‚Äôs kinda cool.  Some negatives. 1. Where you check in is not the hotel you have to drive to your room or as for me (truck driver) squeeze your truck in their parking lot or walk half a mile to get to the suite. 2. Small bathtub. 3. Short shower. If your tall your going to have to bend to get your head under the shower. 4. Pillows got rock hard after laying on them for a few minutes 5. Very few phone charger stations.

They do serve buffalo burgers in the convenient store and the do have a small restaurant in the hotel lobby. They also charge a 20$ incidental fee when you check in."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVc19qNzlnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,Pretty neat little truck stop. The cafe is great! Open 24/7 as well. They sell a variety of items. Including cricket snacks?!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRc0syN0d3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,We were getting tired and decided to stop here for the night.  We have been visiting this place off and on for many years but had not ever spent the night.  We were surprised at how reasonable the prices were and the rooms were clean and actually stylish.  Made it feel like a small apartment.  Seem to be fairly well sound insulated as I did not hear much nose which made for a good night's sleep.  The little store has beer which rocked after a long day of driving!!  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I will be making a point to stay here in the future.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBbHREYlZ3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Full filled our basic need for a night's sleep while we avoided snowy highways.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVMHJHS2NBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I always stop here on my trips between Reno and Denver. The grounds are nicely manicured and the store has a large selection of food, drinks, and travel supplies. They have a grill with reasonably price food and $0.75 vanilla ice cream cones to sweeten the stop! While I have never stayed the night, the hotel has a Victorian style feel to it and the employees wear cute vintage uniforms. The restrooms are usually pretty clean and employees have always been helpful and friendly.  I will continue to make it a pit stop on my travels."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJOTZtMWJnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I have driven by little America a few time on trips. I had to do some work in Wyoming so this time I stayed there. Really cool place, kind of takes you back in time.
Nothing really negative to say. The key system is a little different. It‚Äôs a electronic metal key. Had some issues getting it to work in my door. Maintanance came got it open. But even the next day it didn‚Äôt work as quickly as it should. Kind of had to find it‚Äôs sweet spot. I don‚Äôt think it would have been as much of an issue during the summer. It was about 10 degrees out while I‚Äôm screwing around with it."

Also, 75 cent ice cream cones!!!!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ0czh1dS1BRRAB,A Google Maps review about a bistro.,"We sat at the Chef's table tonight (6/14/19), were served by Kira, Jenn and Chef John. We had such a wonderful time through great service, top notch food and a remarkable atmosphere, that I spontaneously proposed to my girlfriend (without even having a ring). If that doesn't deserve 5 stars, nothing does. Our food included escargot, French onion soup, asparagus soup, halibut, the filet medallions, and the mousse dessert. We also had several drinks, and our bill was under $180. A FABULOUS value compared to many 5-star restaurants. Thank you, Joe (RIP), and we will be back!!!!"

We had a tented reception with cocktail hour on the gorgeous East Balcony with stunning views of Lake Michigan. The restaurant's white pillars were a perfect location for photos and the surrounding park offered more beautiful options all with in a walking distance. The staff was fantastic and our guests were thrilled with their prompt and friendly service. We also received many, many compliments on the food from our family and friends; even those ‚Äòhard to impress‚Äô said their meal at Lake Park Bistro was the best they‚Äôd ever had at a wedding. However, the best thing about Lake Park Bistro was working with Dan. He made us feel comfortable and welcome every step of the way and provided us with excellent advice to make our day fun and stress-free. Dan was clear in all of our communications and went above and beyond to host a meeting for myself and my other vendors. His honest feedback and recommendations helped make our day personal, special, and truly, the best day of our lives. We truly can not say enough about our wonderful experience at Lake Park Bistro, thank you Dan and team!!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZOHE3dWZREAE,A Google Maps review about a bistro.,"I thought my mom and I would have really enjoyed this restaurant, but we were a bit underwhelmed and feel that Le Reve in Tosa and Pastiche in downtown are better options in Milwaukee for French cuisine.

Things we liked:
‚Äîthe view of Lake Michigan
‚Äîfree parking!
‚Äîthe butter (kinda random, but it was really good!)
‚Äîthe wine pairings for the Menu de Chef
‚Äîthe service from our waiter‚Äôs assistant (I think her name was Michelle)
‚Äîmy dessert, which was an Earl Grey pot de creme with honey brittle and lavender chantilly creme. The bright, lemony Riesling was a perfect pair.

Things we didn‚Äôt care for:
‚Äîour waiter made the same spiel for the specials at every table and became a broken record.
‚Äîthe soup l‚Äôoignon was so-so, a little too sweet
‚Äîthe entrees could have used more vegetables to brighten up the plate
‚Äîmy filet was well-done when I ordered it rare, but they were quick to fix that
‚Äînoisy in our room and was difficult to maintain conversation
‚Äîwe got a bit of a pretentious air to the place

Overall, this place was nice, but didn‚Äôt knock our socks off. However, I would go there again for drinks and dessert."

The service was stellar and VERY safe however we were not quite thrilled with our  food. It was almost as if the kitchen has an entirely new staff.. perhaps new suppliers/wholesalers??  My Oeuf Mollet avec Champignons des Bois was prepared differently, the mussels were definitely different. And my favorite fois gras dish has a new bland fruit or vegetable to accompany it vs the old one which was a sweet fruit that was such a great compliment to such a savory protein. Lastly,  I had a lobster entree that was prepared in a ""beef stock"" like base... Almost like it should have accompanied beef vs. fresh lobster. I hate to sound harsh but I am just being honest.  And FYI the menu is now a set 3 or 4 course menu. We will certainly come back however having eaten here so many times for so many special occasions.. we were a bit disappointed compared to any previous visit.  One last note.. just a thought... Why is it I cannot find a desert chef in Milwaukee who makes Panna Cotta? The last time we found it was at Chistopher's (now closed/new owner perhaps) in Sister Bay. That was approximately 10 years ago..I will finish by staring the lemon desert we had was excellent!!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwa0xpMlVnEAE,A Google Maps review about a bistro.,"Really enjoyed our visit here. We came here for the annual fall mushroom dinner and got to taste a great spread of delicacies and unique mushrooms. We enjoyed about 18 different mushrooms blended into our 6 course meals paired with wine! Everything was delicious.

This was our first time here and glad we decided to be here to enjoy the special evening. We got seated right away and the staff were so polite. We also had some food restrictions and our server attended to us right away addressing that. He just made us feel very comfortable and ensured us that the request has been taken care off.

We visited here for dinner but I would love to visit here again during the day because based on the location, it overlooks the beautiful Lake Michigan and I can only imagine how gorgeous the view would be from the hill top! It's an upscale restaurant and is great for special occasions! They offer a lot of speciality themed dinners (just like the mushroom one) so I would really recommend joining in for one of those if you get a chance! It's awesome :)"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX1A3blZnEAE,A Google Maps review about a bistro.,"Myself and 5 friends went tonight to celebrate our good friend's engagement and wedding coming up next month with something a little different! We had an amazing time, the food was totally different than what we normally would find but so good, we had a ton of fun picking out our meals, trying all the different things, and just enjoying the experience. The wait staff was phenomenal, I honestly think Allison was a highlight of our evening. She was very personable, made us feel entirely comfortable, and had great tips and information on the menu.

We were gifted with extras at dessert, champagne for those of us that partook in cocktails and N/A sparkling juice for those that didn't and it was SO good! Super refreshing! We also (seriously, they were so amazing) were gifted a bite of something delicious - I apologize for not remembering what it was by the pastry chef this evening - but it had almonds, was a dessert bar of some sort and it was really good - not super sweet, honestly would have gone great with coffee if any of us had room for it - which we most certainly did not.

The atmosphere was wonderful, even being in proximity to other tables it still felt intimate enough that we couldn't hear other parties' conversations, nor could they hear ours, and I feel like we were a little rambunctious at times. Also, my friends that had cocktails said nothing but high praise for them - my coke with lime was also top notch * in case anyone cared ;)

Food. That's why you're reading this, yeah?
It was good. Like, really great. It also felt like a performance at times. Lots of fun pouring, super attentive taking items away, never once had to ask for anything, be it water, napkin, silverware, etc etc. Maybe we're cheap dates but I'm fairly certain everyone went above and beyond, exceeding our expectations. Thanks for a great experience!

In case my photo captions don't save:
1. Scallops
2. Surprise Carrot & Cardamom Soup option (big fan of this, you don't know unless you KNOW)
3. Beef Medallion Filet - my favorite of the 3 savory dishes
4. The best dang dessert option there is - even though the mousse looked and sounded amazing - I will DIE on this chocolatey-citrus hill any day. Any. Day. This chocolate cake (better than the chocolate cake in your head, bet) and orange sorbet - beyond. Be.yond."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBNTVlbGZnEAE,A Google Maps review about a bistro.,This is a fancy place for big occasions. Try this out for birthdays or anniversaries and you will like it. Lakefront view is good when there is sunlight. In the evenings in winter the sparkles of the icicles reflect through the windows. Food is varied and with guidances from the helpful staff you can find the right mix. Vegetarian options are available. Cheese plates are great too. The restaurant is spacious and very well decorated.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJNmU3Wjd3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a bistro.,Always good and  no surprise! food was very good. We had set brunch menu with 3 courses and they were delicious.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRenN6NFlBEAE,A Google Maps review about a bistro.,"Excellent food with a nice view of the lake. The servers walk around with a basket of French baguette pieces that are offered throughout the meal. I had the Coquilles Saint Jacques which includes 3 seared scallops on a bed of beech mushrooms and a flavorful puree. It was delicious.  Not very filling, but delicious. For dessert I had the Mousse Au Chocolat Yves Camdeborde which was to die for. It is a chocolate mousse piece with a praline crust and had coconut sorbet and a piece of coconut crunch. It was played beautifully and the flavors were amazing together."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdXJQUjZRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a bistro.,"Such a wonderful spot, Lake Park Bistro brings a medley of foods and flavors that elevate the dining scene in Milwaukee.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzN0lxMlBnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I have not stayed in any rooms at this casino but have spent a little bit of time here gambling and eating on a few occasions. I've always had a good time and the food is always been phenomenal. Everyone here is always been very friendly from the slot associates, dealers to the security staff. Upstairs on the second floor before you go to into the sky bridge over to the silver legacy there is a large game room for the kids to spend their time in while the parents are here enjoying themselves. I wish I would have came here when my children were younger would have been an awesome place first our family entertainment as circus circus is the only casinos that I have ever encountered that are truly catering to the whole family."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eHVYQm9RRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,Nice place.  Lots of things to do for kids and young at heart. Lots of games like being at the fair. But beware the once the taxes and resort fees are added the room charges double the price. Which is probably true for all the resorts. It was nice to have wifi and parking.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNd2ZQSjFRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"We had a good time, it's pretty small and when its busy it is hard to move around.

Rooms are relatively new , good decoration , room was well lit and decoration on the wall behind the bed was cool! Furniture looked new and trendy , had coffee pods as complementary, had coffee üôÇ

Bathroom had a trendy and upgraded look! Liked it very much!

What else!! Casino is fun, the gaming zone is fun, the walkway is connected to Silver Legacy and Eldorado!!

The short circus show were one of the main attractions! üòâ"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMVo2azdnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Nice rooms, buffet is closed, good parking.  We left a jacket in our room after check-out and it took two days for someone to go to the room to look for it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMUlMSTdBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"It's been a few years since we have stayed here and unfortunately will probably be the last time. I received an email inviting me to stay there which stated they had newly remodeled rooms, which made us want to go ahead and book here instead of our usual other option. Well, our visit was less than satisfying. We drove up Sunday afternoon to check in and were told there was no valet service - park across the street, and walk back to check in (was not allowed to keep my car in their driveway while checking in). Not a good start. Check in line had about 10 parties waiting to check in and only two front desk folks (after about 10 minutes one more front desk agent showed up). Once in the room, I was confused how they could state the rooms were remodeled(?). Bathroom was great (only one hook to hang towels), the room was painted, but the furniture was still old and scratched up, the chair was creaking with every move and the thermostat was very dirty (not huge, but very noticeable). The casino had no live tables, so we had to go somewhere else to play - I prefer to just stay in my hotel to gamble. As far as the 'Resort Fee', it lists 2 water bottles (helpful on a 100 degree day), but never got that - I called down to see if they could be brought over and never got them. There were a couple of coffee pods with a sign stating they will be refreshed every morning, they are not. I called the 2nd morning to get a couple, but ended up running to Starbucks instead (Why are they charging a resort fee???). If this covers the parking, maybe think about charging the people parking in your lot and not staying at your hotel.
In any case, with all the alternative hotels in Reno I will not be booking another room at Circus Circus. I'll keep the old memories of what they used to be years ago.
One plus, we enjoyed the view from our room."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbVpPVFBnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,Great place for kids to feel involved. They have free mini shows on stage in the circus game arcade area for kids.  A food court gambling for adults
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxczVGRxAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Came on a Tuesday night. Masks only suggested for non-vaccinated guests but a surprising number of guests and staff wore one.

Check in was quick. Had a suite room. Clean, spacious, with dual temp control. Large bathroom with shower/tub. Keurig available with coffee pods. Hidden mini fridge. Extra pillows in closet.

Housekeeping came by only to ask if anything was needed, not to clean. I believe they only clean on request and upon check out, but ask the front desk if that's accurate. Asked for extra bath and hand towels; was given two of each.

Check out was 12pm w/Express Check Out option. Dropped off keys in Express Check Out box by elevators."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNE1feWdnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"The room was spacious with a nice view of down town Reno. Check in was quicker than I expected and I love the ""express check out"" option. My only complaint (more like a suggestion) would be that a microwave in the room would be a very nice addition to have."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtb3JITDJ3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Stopped by for a few hours on our way to Cali. I have memories of being here as a child and seeing animals and circus acts. I took my kids in and found the arcade with the stage. There was a short balancing act while we were there. There are lots of shops. The kids blew $95 at the arcade in about 20 minutes and came away with a few cheap stuffed animals. I think they had fun, but it didn't live up to my memories."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBMTRUbkNnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Good place for kids, nice play area for games and carnival type games.  Excellent entertainment every 45 minutes in the carnival area.  This acrobat on the hoop is an amazing talent.  The place feels a little rough and not clean and polished but it‚Äôs not dirty. It just needs some polishing and a decorating consultant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2X2JyZFRBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,The room was very clean and the pillows were better.  For the price it couldn't have been better. Stayed on the 28th floor so the views were breathtaking.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxcDhUc3dnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,It was fun gambling at Circus Circus. The sports book was small and did not have much of a selection of games on but it was okay. I ended up winning on the table games and on a few sporting events. They also had the midway with all the arcade games and carnival games. The kids enjoyed it and was a great spot to take them. I think I lost more money at the Midway than the whole weekend gambling in Reno. We did not stay at the hotel some this review is not about the hotel. Overall it was a good experience for us and I have nothing negative to say about Circus Circus.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhNkstSG5nRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"A great experience, quick free shuttle from the airport. Clean room with nice view from the 12th floor. Thermostat controls and a 50inch TV. Two very comfortable queen beds. Found extra pillows and cases in the closet.

Haven't been in a casino in a few years, prices are higher, the days of the 99 cent TBone steaks and crazy deals are gone.

$60 lunch for 2 is common unless you stick to fast food. Was a good meal and great service. We found a great deal through Trivago, but realized we could have saved more with a direct reservation.

The hotel promise is lowest price, after you find the the best deal call direct they will match the price and refund an additional 10%. Something I'll remember next time. We'll be using this Caesars affiliate again."

Looks a bit old on the inside, like most casinos these days. If gambling is your thing they have everything you can think of (I guess)

Parking space is fairly abundant in the area nearby"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMHZXUmFnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Goods. Room was clean, working personnel nice, friendly and helpful from front desk to security and housekeeping, has a fym/fitness center, nice location, staying here pretty much gets you access to 3 casinos with a walking distance to Reno signature sign.
Bad stuff.
LINES ! If you there on the weekend when everyone else is there well let's say this place can't handle it's own capacity. To check in long line, to get to your room at certain  times there is a (no joking) 40 minutes wait line for elevator, now  it's not always but try to get back to your room when you really need something can be frustrating time in line for elevator.
Noise, I am talking hotel room, you can hear a lot from rooms nextdoor and hallway.
Bathroom!  Now that could be subjective but bathtub is very small, shower pipes makes loud noise while waiting for hot water and sink makes loud bubbly noises after use.
That's all major points. You can have great time staying there if you do it on not busy days, but if you have regular schedule and go there when most of people do, you might get frustrated standing in 40 minutes line for elevator when you just need to go to your room little quick."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBcmJmYW9BRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,Kids had a great time. They loved the games and use adults loved the shows. This visit we only stopped by to let the kids play games. We will be planning a trip to stay at Circus Circus next time. Nice to have the acarde games apart from the ticket and carnival games.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZNmU3bjdnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I haven't been to Las  Vegas but if you have limited time and you are heading to San Francisco or  bay area and if casino is in your bucket list then you definitely need to add Reno to your list. We went on Saturday night and all the casinos were filled. We stayed in circus circus, it's one of the casino among the three giants which hosts its own casino. A perfect place to stay and enjoy in a casino.
Easy check-in and check out.Rooms were good, what else one might in need of. One drawback which I thought is number of boards were very less and casinos were all filled with digital ones which seems to be slightly bothering. All the bar and restaurant were good. Even if you want to take a walk , best time is to go after 10PM . You can have a good view of the lights .
The row is all integrated and you can move between all the 3 casinos . They too have play area like arcade games for little kids . Please note children are not allowed inside the casino .  You need to have alternate arrangements for that.
We loved this place more as this is only 50+ miles from Lake Tahoe and this was helping us to take rest after tiresome day in Lake Tahoe"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbS0tSVpnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,We decided to come here to have breakfast and then hang out in the Arcade. First impression coming in the elevator we‚Äôre old and dirty. Once you get inside the Casino/Hotel it looks way better. We had pancakes and eggs which were delicious but the sausage looked like it had freezer burns on it so we didn‚Äôt eat that. The staff at the restaurant were great and not too long of a wait time. The arcade was fun. A little over priced but the convenience of having it within the hotel could be a plus. We were able to make enough points to cash out for some goodies at their Arcade store. We were able to catch 2 shows while we were there so that was fun as well.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxME16dVZnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Always a fun place to play. They have a midway with great circus acts. I was surprised to see that they took out the Buffet and put in a  food court. It might have been good, it was busy today."

The person that actually helped us out was sweet and fast. Room was okay. Found thing that didn't belong to us in the room kinda nasty. After taking a shower my friend pulled out a towel and this comes flying out!! Luckily she wasn't hit but this. After a worker washing them this must of fell out of a worker pocket or something?! Truly sad and disgusting. We called a supervisor to come see this and all she had to say was sorry. She didn't bother to remove it or anything. I'm truly disappointed on my stay!

When you get out of the room and go down, you literally enter another univers.
The three hotels, called The Row: Circus Circus, El Dorado and Silver Legacy are interlinked and you cannot even realize when you arrive to another hotel if you take a stroll.
It is such an amazing experience, full of people, lights, restaurants, clubs and, of course, many many casinos :)"

Now that I'm well above the age I was so excited to go back so my younger sisters to see what i seen also my 2 year old son. He had a blast on the midway. I think its awesome that they have a place that is just for children because not everyone is over the agr of 21 when they go there. We werent even supposed to be there but due to airport issues we had to stay an extra night and they put us in a hotel 2 casinos down from Circus Circus which is linked with the casino/hotel we stayed in.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNbThXYkJnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I stayed here for a conference. The rooms were big, bright, and adequately clean though worn in places. Definitely request a higher floor for the view. I was disappointed with how limited room service was; breakfast is only available on weekends and can't be pre-ordered. Skipping having my room cleaned for a credit at The Row restaurants was worthwhile, especially as it was cold enough that I didn't want to walk around outside. The bed was comfortable, but the desk chair was not. The size of the room contributes to accessibility, and there was a grab bar next to but not inside the show/bathtub."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNMllQeFlnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Very kid friendly place. Made a stop for the kids to unwind on our family trip, and they did enjoy the large game room.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyc1lERHRBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,I didn‚Äôt stay at the hotel just wondered the casino. The Circus area is really cool. Definitely a good spot for kids. The actual casino itself is starting to look a little dated. There are three casinos in a row so you can easily navigate between all of them. They also offer circus shows but we were told due to Covid they don‚Äôt offer the shows every day and no one knew exactly when they had the show.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzcHAtaE9REAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"While I've never stayed at the hotel here, I've visited the arcade and restaurants many times. Food is always very good and there's lots of fun things to do here, as well as a live performance every so often. Great place to come with the kids!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2MF95aTZnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Visited there with my family and my friends family and we had four kids with us. All of them including all the adults had really fun playing the games. Me and my five played almost 10 games and won so many plush toys.

There is something for everything I'm sure you would go and find something that you love since your childhood and you will definitely try to win that game.

They have a kiosk machine on which you can get a new card or load your old card. Machine accepts both card and cash which is really easy to use.

Stuff is friendly and helpful. Overall the place is really good for kids I would strongly recommend to keep this in your visit list whenever you go to Reno with your kids.

And I'm sure even if you visit it as an adult without kids also you would love this place."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdThiNlVnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,I booked a high floor spa suite. Advertised to have a mountain view. Ended up on the fourth floor with 2 small windows looking at the side of a building. Notice in the pictures duct tape to fix the carpet. There is graffiti on a picture on the wall. The shower was dirty and the pull out sofa was so worn out. It had old dirty sheets and a large stain. The room was worse than I could have imagined. My son had fun in the midway.  But next time I will definitely stay in a different hotel.

Very disappointed. Bell desk guy was great though!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbElQQ0tnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Disgusting. Came here before and after Burning Man, our rooms were dirty and had hair everywhere- even the cups in the room had used coffee all over them and there were used paper towels shoved into the crack of our bed. Gross!!! The bell hops were never at the desk and when they were they refused to help guests with their bags because they were dirty. Mind you most of these guests were people of color who did not attend Burning Man and had perfectly clean bags. I am disgusted by the service here and will never come back."

I really enjoyed photographing it all.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzOGMyUnlRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"One of the better hotels in the area it would seem. Rooms are very clean and modern in comparison to the competition. Plenty of food and entertainment options as this hotel spans across three different hotels that are all connected. The arcade was cool.
Fitness center was probably the hottest, most poorly ventilated fitness center I‚Äôve been in, and one of the smallest. Very difficult to do extended amounts of cardio. However, it was clean and available for use. So it was appreciated."

Would love to visit again. Way after Covid leaves. Lol"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1azd5M1dBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Great location if you want to be near the night life and other casinos. The rooms are spacious and comfy and the water pressure and temperature are perfect. It's difficult to deal with customer service when there are issues; they are very dismissive. I recommend booking from a 3rd party for the discounts (of course, always call the hotel and compare prices first) but there will always be a separate resort fee, as with most hotels and casino's. The casino smells like the rest but the kids area seems to have better odor control. Worth the stay üé™"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcjVMTktBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,Just dont expect the same level of entertainment thats found at the Vegas location.  There was only one show per day. There was only 2 roaming drink servers...which we rarely saw. Plenty of games for ppl with kids. I was surprised that indoor smoking was permitted. I was approached and asked if I wanted to buy perfume. My friend was approached and asked if she wanted to buy gold jewelry. Two ATMs were out of money. The room staff was exceptionally friendly. The concierge desk was not manned the majority of the time. We called airlines and departed a day early.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJbnF1S3lRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Stayed for New Years, and got to see the fireworks which were spectacular. Definitely geared for kids. We loved the arcade and the circus acts happening every hour. The arcades, I think are good value, usually around a dollar to play a game and prizes were generous. My son also loved the free train that goes to and fro the sky tower. I would almost say this hotel as kids friendly, but I cannot because of their smoking policy. Them owning, the whole ‚Äúrow‚Äù, I wish they could make the circus-circus third, smoke free, and then I would honor them 5 stars."

I told them before checking in that my husband has heart failure,  that he can not be in a dirty environment. They assured me numerous times that there rooms were ""very clean"".
They were anything but clean. I immediately called the front desk when we arrived in the room. They wouldn't send anyone to look at the room. They made me take pictures and come back downstairs.
The manager wouldn't speak to me so the guy at the front desk had to take my phone back to his office to show him the pictures. The manger never spoke with me. They did put me in a better room eventually,however the next morning when I checked out they ended up charging me more!!!!! I asked to speak to a manger and was denied again.  This is absolutely the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. No"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNHQ2M3VBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"DO NOT COME. Their tariffs are not transparent. They charged US 200 extra dollars when we arrived to the hotel, even if their website wasn't working and we weren't able to get the rooms on the internet. They are understaffed so we lost a lot of time trying to make the check in. If that's not enough, we FOUND A NAIL IN OUR ROOM!!! THIS PLACE IS NOT CLEAN."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcGNlMnl3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"We had a mini suite, the room was decently clean but the shower was horrible, it was like an ultra pressure super blast shower and you couldn't change the spray angle, also it would fill with water quickly because the drain didn't work.
By far the worst part of the room was the lack of curtains or any type of shade (see pics), we had to use couch cushions in the main room to block the glaring morning son, the management and staff were no help at all.
Would not stay again."

Midway staff was depressing. They seemed to hate their life and job. The games were reasonably priced though. The family enjoyed the performance and games. Just don't expect even 2nd rate treatment from carnival staff. They weren't rude, just not nice. No room service. Hotel is confusing to maneuver at first but we caught on quickly. Overall, a good value and we enjoyed ourselves. Will stay again if in reno."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteDhYQlRREAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I've stayed here twice within the last year, the first time my room in the casino tower was a lot more run down and old than I am used to and I low key had an eerie feeling from the room I stayed in the first time. Maybe something happened there before I don't know, but I felt this odd coldness/a feeling that made me uneasy. I was hesitant to stay here but I decided to book again since I was only here for a couple days.

My 2nd visit this past week was decent. The hotel itself is older of course, but it gives the basic necessities. I was in the sky tower this time and it felt more updated than the casino tower?

Heating/cooling system worked perfectly. I had a corner room which had a nice view of the city.

I would give this rating a lot lower for the incident that happened, but I will assume it was a rare occurrence where someone walks in your room without knocking. The woman Apologized, but I felt really uncomfortable because I could've been naked or in the shower. It was totally inappropriate, I messaged the concierge Ivy person thing and they apologized but never offered to do anything...

Water quality from the faucets were questionable, I ran the hot and cold and both looked heavy, see photo. But cleared up after I ran it for some time.

Shower ran well too. Water temp was well controlled. So everything else was fine with the room. Nothing extravagant, I just got a normal king size room.

Anyways, I like the convenience of the hotels location and how it's connected to the other, Silver Legacy, el Dorado, etc. We enjoy the arcade and circus shows too. Staff are friendly for the most part. They have a better food court now than they did 12 years ago, so there are improvements here and there.

I love that they still have a lot of old mixed with new. I love the history of the buildings and seeing that throughout the halls and rooms of the buildings. Please maintain the history  I think that's what really entices visitors too!

Overall I would stay again for the location for sure."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJc0tURDJnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a escape room center.,A FUN Night
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJdmJpVkRBEAE,A Google Maps review about a escape room center.,"Our experience here was awesome! My boyfriend and I did 'The Lost Ship' room. It was a Wednesday 7pm booking, so just the two of us took on the challenge without anyone else booking in. And we escaped with 90 seconds to spare!! Our guide, Captain Charles, did a fantastic job introducing the room to us with this whole back story to set us up. If you pay close attention, there are clues in everything he's saying as well.

The room itself was the best part. It was actually several rooms all joined together and from the lobby you had to figure out how to even enter the main room in the first place‚Äîsuper cool! I had never seen anything like that before. The puzzles were also really well thought out and interesting, using logic and problem solving (not at all abstract or random). Of all the escape rooms I have done, I would say that this has been the best experience I have had because of the attention to detail in the room, the quality of the puzzles, and the experience of being able to solve it with just the two of us.

The room is actually designed for at least 6 people, because it would have been helpful for others to take on and simultaneously solve riddles in the room. I'm pretty amazed we were able to do it with just 2 (but it was mostly because we had a few timely hints... big ones, lol). Awesome experience, highly recommend!!!

P.S. - This location has only this room (Pirate's Booty 2 - The Lost Ship), and the other rooms are in their downtown location. So don't be confused ^_^"

It took us a little over two hours to go around the grounds. I did the mistake to wear flip flops. Best to wear sneakers because there is no pavement. Take insect repellent and drinking water.  There are no drinking fountains. Plenty of picnic tables.  Overall we had a nice time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNna2ZTdHRnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"We were lucky enough to get a private tour thanks to a GHA/Omni Local Experience and really enjoyed meeting its Director, Patti Clark.The Zoo has the admirable mission of 'not existing at all' since without abused, injured and abandoned animals to rescue, it wouldn't need to be here.

Patti could relay every story of each animal on our tour, and although many of its inhabitants were transfers from closed pet stores and zoos, the majority were exotic pets from owners who never considered what happens when a bear, panther or alligator grows up. This zoo is the final destination for these animals where they get to live out the rest of their days without transfer.

While there are no giraffes, polar bears or theme park rides, there's an enthusiastic and friendly staff caring for several hundred animals that otherwise most likely would have been euthanized. This non-profit is continuously building new enclosures and facilities and hosts daily programs and talks for kids and adults alike, in its effort to house animals from the 40-50 calls they get every month.

Austin Zoo is not a flashy place and doesn't have multi-million dollar enclosures and exhibits. You can see your entrance fee and donations in action, and the focus is on providing the best possible support for rescued animals. I'd strongly recommend visiting - kids will always love a trip to the zoo - but for adults the ethical mission is the real draw."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnNGJILWd3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"A nice rescue zoo a short drive from downtown ATX.

This zoo isn't extremely big or fancy, but you can tell they care about the animals. The animals are taken in from bad situations and rehabilitated and cared for.

The exhibits have educational material about the species of animals, but also about each individual animals situation and how they ended up being cared for by the zoo.

This is a much different experience than a big zoo, it's a lot quieter and less crowded if that's what you are looking for. It's also kind cheated more affordable than a big zoo. You can easily see the whole zoo in an hour, but if you take your time there's plenty to do for a couple of hours."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVLTQ3VWZREAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,Such a n eww at zoo!  You are fairly close to the animals and there is a decent variety of animals!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDeS02YzhRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"I‚Äôve been going to the Austin zoo for years, and I've always loved it. It's perfect if you have small kids- they have a petting zoo, peacocks walking around, an adorable train ride,  you can spend a couple of hours or less and that's plenty off time to see everything.
However, they have really gone downhill. The prices are ridiculous. I had no idea you had to purchase tickets online. They made my kids and I stand under a tree while everyone got to go through. I was finally waved over and able to pay. I felt like a naughty kid being punished. The bathrooms are closed down- two nasty porta potties. There is no longer much to see. I seriously don‚Äôt think you get what you pay for."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVbGZxX05BEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,Austin zoo is the best because it's also a sanctuary. They never sell or buy animals for profit.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OGJmbHB3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Make sure you catch one of the the hourly train rides during your adventure! It‚Äôs a great way to ‚Äúfind‚Äù an ostrich and see the rolling hills. Grab some feed for the barnyard critters & enjoy the sights of free range peacocks.

There are a few ‚Äúoff limits‚Äù from the pandemic, but still a good time for families. When you arrive you‚Äôll use an alternate entrance & you can honestly enjoy this entire zoo without ever stepping foot inside a building. (Please note this also means consider the potty needs of your party beforehand.)"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvenBqZkNBEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Absolutely LOVE the quaintness of this little zoo. Feels like a small town zoo with its rustic trails. Animals are healthy and happy and you can tell that those who work there are genuinely there for the animals. Be sure to grab a couple of bags of food to feed the goats, llamas, deer and sheep. Don't go too late in the day or you'll find all the big animals sleeping."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXd0tINjN3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Lions, tigers and kids oh my! Austin zoo is prides themselves in giving rescued animals a chance for a new life. They take them in, feed and care for them.

They have an area where you can feed goats & llamas. Peacocks strut their colorful, eye-catching feathers around the park.

It‚Äôs a perfect venue for your child‚Äôs birthday party! You can reserve a private room and even learn about animals & pet one!

Don‚Äôt forget to take a ride on the train with your little ones! It‚Äôs always a big hit!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLLU0zVzFnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"For being Austin, we expected the zoo to have better selections. Most of the places are closedown. Staff is constantly walking to make sure you wear the mask although the Texas Gov agreed for outdoors to be a free mask zone.
But the staff kept trying to enforced it on my toddler (2 years old) . My daughter‚Äôs mask fits her a little bit loose, so the lady was asking to put it more tighter although it was covering her nose.
There‚Äôs no Giraffes ü¶í.
There‚Äôs more of a bird ü¶¢ selection, monkeys üêí, goats üêêAnd üêñ pig (be careful with the pig)

I believed it‚Äôs overpriced for the few animals you get to see. But if you want to see it for yourself then go for it. Lots of construction."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNHViYUdBEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Had some free time on a Sunday morning and thought we'd check out the zoo in our new city. Now we're from San Diego (home to the World Famous San Diego Zoo) so we know great zoos. As my teenager daughter said, it's like a petting zoo. This is not your typical zoo. They rescue animals (there was a three-legged fox there). The walkways are dirt. The variety of animals is limited. I'd say this is a great place for families with young kids. It's a couple hour adventure for young ones. We walked through in under an hour."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNveEkyV2FnEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,Great concept: a zoo with rescue animals.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMHJIUVJBEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,It was a small zoo but it felt like a sanctuary- unlike other zoo it didn't seem commercialized with vendors.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvODlQMjJnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"This place is 15 acres of many different species of rescued animals. You can pet and feed llamas, alpacas, sheep and goats.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTc2FXUGNREAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,We had a nice time at the zoo. I loved that every plate describing the species had their names and birthdays - very cute! The large cats were very majestic. The train could be improved with running more often than once an hour on high volume days. The animals looked mostly health. We did watch a goat get tackled by the workers and it  looked like they were forcing some medicine - understandable but probably more appropriate time to do it or heads up to the people right by the enclosure as it looked super distressed/ scared and for some of the kids that was a little scary to watch.

Think it'd be cool if they had a different set up for the owl they have though that kept it dark inside her habitat during the day so it would be awake instead of asleep hardly in sight. Just a small suggestion. Still had a great experience here, the staff were kind and informative. Will definetely be back again!"

Since there‚Äôs so many trees, it was shaded basically the entire zoo, which is a must in the Texas sun.

Love that this is a rescue zoo and their conservation mission. We loved reading about where each animal came from.

Also, since the animals are rescued, they weren‚Äôt hiding like they do in normal zoos. We went as soon as they open, and everyone was out and about in their exhibits.

Our favorite part was definitely feeding the goats and alpacas but it was also amazing seeing lions and cougars that close up!

We will definitely be back and will be bringing friends!!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhbFB6aGVREAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"This is not a flashy zoo, and it is really off the beaten path. You won't see extremely exotic critters. They have lemurs, monkeys, tortoises, snakes, parrots, bears, lions, tigers and a petting zoo section.

Why would you come here, then? Because you'll feel good patronizing a place with its mission. They rescue animals and give them a better life.

I like a zoo that not only cares for their animals, but also tries to make sure people know how hard it is to care for parrots. I like a zoo whose staff connect with the patrons. And folks, I loved the alpacas and prairie dogs as well as the other critters I listed. Recommended."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMUlXOGt3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"DON‚ÄôT GO IF YOUR CHILD WON‚ÄôT WEAR A MASK!

My friend and I and our four children, ages 4,3,2 and 7 months visited the Austin Zoo earlier this week.
The good: It is so classic Austin. Nestled on a hillside on the outskirts of town amidst lots of cedar trees, there were no paved walkways. I loved it. You can get through it in about an hour and feel like you didn‚Äôt miss much, which is great with small children. They have a fun interactive petting zoo and peacocks roaming around all over. Love it!
The not-so-good: I confess most of this is due to my comparison experience with the zoo in my city- South Bend, IN (home of Mayor Pete Buttegieg). Our zoo is about comparable in size and number and type of animals. We also have no elephants, but we do have rhinos and will be getting giraffes soon. The surprising part of this is that South Bend is about a tenth of the size of Austin. I think maybe the Austin Zoo wants only rescue animals, and there aren‚Äôt rescue elephants...I don‚Äôt know. There are also a lot more cages at the Austin Zoo whereas South Bend has created much more natural habitats for most of their animals.
By far the biggest, most frustrating difference, however, was the mask policy. In the South Bend Zoo, and most places, you are only required to wear masks inside or if you can‚Äôt social distance. (FYI I am VERY pro-mask, but within reason). This even includes the animal feeding area in the South Bend Zoo. In Austin everyone, including small children 2 and over, are required to wear masks even outdoors (which is the entire zoo basically) unless you are eating. On a windy day from 20 feet away the chances of passing on Covid are so low even the CDC wouldn‚Äôt require this. It seems so unlikely Covid could be passed on to people or animals in that scenario. The Austin Zoo seemed possibly more concerned about their animals catching Covid than people, and I haven‚Äôt read about animals becoming seriously ill with Covid.
Wearing masks for adults I do not believe is much to ask, but for my friend‚Äôs 4 year old, she was very very upset, and refused to put one on. Children are not used to having to wear masks outdoors. Luckily they allowed us to stay as long as we promised to distance from the animals, but we were pretty worried we were going to be kicked out having seen almost none of the zoo‚Äîand tickets are NOT CHEAP. You even have to pay for 2 year olds. It goes without saying we didn‚Äôt do the petting zoo.
So bottom line-great zoo, but don‚Äôt go if you think your child will refuse to wear a mask."

That being said, great for kids but pretty sad as most of them were ""pets"" who were abandoned and major stress and mental suffering was clearly present. Left me feeling down a bit. Amazing galopagose tortoise and other animals too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRZzZLb3VRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"It's not a zoo so much as a rescue and a zoo combined. It's not all concrete like so many zoos. It's like taking a hike through the woods, but with lion and tigers and bears! Oh my! They even have a little train now that they rescued from Zilker, and for just a few bucks they'll take you through the Texas Hill Country. It's gorgeous and you don't have to get all sweaty walking. And then of course there's the animals. They're well taken care of with clean enclosures. Plus there's chickens and peacocks wandering free everywhere. Which is a huge plus! It's a really great place for birthday parties. Kids love it, but then so do the adults. Go there!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBNzh6WVVnEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Came here for my friends kids birthday and it was super fabulous! I enjoy going to the zoo, this is a different type of zoo than most people are used too. The zoo is smaller than most, but it's also more laid back and casual to me. It is more of a re-homing facility for animals who have a long back story. They are definitely doing good work here! All the animals seem to be enjoying their time and they are getting love. I think it is much different than a standard zoo but it's also different in a good way. It is a non-profit and to me I think they are doing very good things for the animals and educating the children in our area. I noticed it might be difficult to get around for those who have strollers and or wheel chairs, they gravel is a little tough and there are some dips and holes, but I don't mind watching where I walk. I feel like they are spending the money on the right things. I think it's a great place to take children! The birthday party pavilion was great! It was very cool in there and plenty of space. The staff was super friendly and helpful! If I had kids I'd bring them back here often, I'd probably even take guests who are animal lovers here to visit as well!

The parking lot is not paved, but we didn't have issues coming in a car. Just something to keep in mind for those who have low cars, etc."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtZ1l1T3hBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"I hardly ever leave bad reviews but compared to San Antonio zoo this place was such a let down. Most of the animals are all caged up so you can‚Äôt really see them. We went on pretty chilly day and all the tropical birds were sharing one little heat lamp and you could tell they were so distressed. The animals looked pretty miserable to be honest. The only parts we enjoyed were the feeding of the farm animals which you can‚Äôt even do like at a petting zoo you have to feed them through the fence. The train and the conductor were the best part. He was super nice and pretty funny. He offered to take our pics which I appreciated. But if your not from Austin and thinking about making the trip out here‚Ä¶don‚Äôt. Seriously the snake farm in new branfuels was in better shape and condition than this. Drive out to San Antonio and go to a real zoo or if your looking for something more hands on drive to Johnson city to go to the exotic resort zoo, there are a lot more animals there and they look much more attended too. We left this place pretty sad."

I saw almost all (94%) the animals and some places were roped off (due to COVID) but they had it so you could get a close to the animals as possible. The placards they had to show us where the animals came from and their names were great and I really love that they were rescue animals that means a lot to people! The staff was super friendly and answered the questions even the ones that were about the animals ar the vet. I would love to come and get closer to the animals and bring my family, it was a great experience. Again I really love they are rescues üíúüíúüíúüíúüíú"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcU12VUlBEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"We had so much fun at this little zoo. My kiddos loved seeing all the peacocks walking around. Their favorites were the big cats, which were mine too. Some of the animals actually look towards you if you call their names. We got the memberships and can't wait to go back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnXzczYk53EAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"This was our first time.  Keep in mind that the basis for this zoo is an animal sanctuary, so no giant animals here, although there is a lot of variety and some very good species on display.  It is good for the kids and very interactive with the animals that you can feed and the peafowl roaming.  The train ride was a nice conclusion to our day."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtcTRHQXNRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"It's a small zoo but worth the trip. I recommend going once a little warmer. We went when it's a bit cold so some of the animals weren't out. But we still had a good time and I honestly like the outdoor feel. It's a lovely place and a great time for the family. It felt more natural for the animals.

Edit: Also just wanna say going during winter is very worth it!!! It's still a great place to go :) lovely."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBajVUVVNREAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"This is nice small zoo with a good variety of animals. I love that this is a non-profit and my admission fees help support the animals. It's small enough to get through in just over an hour, but can be longer if you feed the animals or watch one of the shows."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLOEluYTl3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"The only reason I give three stars is because my kids liked it. I was comparing it to the Ft. Worth, Dallas, and Oklahoma City zoos and it is just not anywhere as nice as those and it still cost my family of four $57. The reptile house was closed (big bummer because my kids love snakes), the bathrooms were closed (porta-potties) and they told me the reason reptile house was closed was it's too small inside for covid reasons... but you can still go in the gift shop. I was annoyed that they make all visitors over age of 2 wear a mask at all times... in an outdoor, plenty of room setting! The zoo has no paved walkways and water has washed lots of gullies where I almost turned my ankle. I was not given a map and the signage was lacking so we just wandered. Tickets are sold from a trailer. I found the animal enclosures to be difficult to see animals through. The white tiger and peacocks were cool."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3ak15WHdRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"The zoo has a surprisingly large amount of animals, for being rescued animals. We were interested to learn that some of the animals were given to the zoo after their original zoos were damaged in hurricanes. The feeding area was a fun addition to just viewing the animals. My two year old nephew loved the short ride on the mini zoo train. The ride doesn't go by many animals, but It was his first train ride, so he was thrilled. Another fun part of the zoo is the wondering peacocks and chickens. Overall, a great little zoo!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZeTY2VnhRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a german restaurant.,"This is truly a hidden gem!

They have a dance group anyone can join; it's been very fun! Wednesdays at 7PM, except for the 2nd Wednesday each month.  I have literally no dance background, but this is folk dancing, so that's fine üòÅ

Edelweiss is located in German Park at the end of the drive.  The park itself isn't anything major, but the scenery is very nice.
Once at the parking lot, you can go in the main entrance and down the stairs to the restaurant or follow the sidewalk north of the building where it slopes down and around the building to their outdoor seating. You can see a gnome garden along the way!
I've seen comments saying this place isn't handicap accessible, but this sidewalk is the entrance to take if you have a wheelchair or stroller.  Understandably, this will be inconvenient if it is raining.
The outdoor seating is the beer garden area and the doors lead into the restaurant.

On Wednesdays there is a buffet.  I'm writing this review after a stop at their buffet and I'm impressed.
On Fridays they have live music; simply amazing fun!

They have several events through the year and I definitely recommend checking them out! Fr√ºhlingsfest, J√§gerfest, Octoberfest and more!

Through the year, they have several German events, including an Octoberfest.  From what I hear, it's a blast!

Additionally, a local Duolingo group has started holding language events here and, separately, there is a lady who gives basic German lessons in the fall.
*Note* September 2022 - I'm not certain if these have started up again yet."

This place offers homestyle dishes like someone else's mom made, and they're all delicious. My favorite was the shepherds pie, but everything they served was great. Wednesday nights are ""buffeteria"" style. They serve you like a cafeteria but you keep going back until you're finished. Non-members price was $16.95 which I felt was fair for the quality of food and service provided. If you want to try something a little out of the ordinary I highly recommend a Edelweiss! I'll certainly be back when I cost the area again. Call ahead reservations are recommended."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbDdlaVB3EAE,A Google Maps review about a german restaurant.,"This place is amazing.  Talk about taking yourself back in time for a minute you feel like you are in Germany.  They open at 5pm for dinner only.  You drive down this  dark road, and you would never know there was a parking lot and a restaurant from the top of the road.
You go inside from the parking lot on a top level,  down a flight of  stairs is the restaurant.  They do have an elevator for handicap.
Once below it's amazing.  It's small probably about 30 tables, wooden walls, and all decorated with Germany memorabilia.
I was so excited to try this place the last time I had German food was in Germany 20 plus years ago.  I still remember what that tasted like.
There was 2 waitress serving and taking orders. Lisa was our waitress.  She is such a nice lady,  and definitely knows her menu,  and has worked their for a long time.  I ordered the German beer on tap it was very light, clear, and refreshing. My other half Bayrischer Schweinebraten it was a tender slow roasted pork shoulder.  I tasted the dish and it was amazing.  Very tender and with lots of flavor.  It was not sliced it was more like chunk pork. His side was the sliced apples.  I have never tried apples sliced fresh, in a cinnamon sauce.  I wish you could order this by the pint or quart to take home.  Amazing!
I ordered J√§gerschnitzel which was delicious with the cream white wine sauce, and mushroom.  The sauce was so good I asked for a little more sauce. The pork meat was tender, and a nice slice. My sides was potato pancakes oh my goodness hold the fork these were not greasy at all.  I put the sour cream and applesauce on the potato cakes. My other side I was wanting to try was the German potato salad.  It was good, completely traditional,  but not my favorite for my taste buds. Before dinner you have a choice of soup or salad.  I definitely tried the soup which was really good the traditional red cabbage soup.
I can't wait to come back to try more dishes.
For dessert if you have room definitely order the bread pudding with the warm whiskey sauce.  You will want to make room for this dessert.
We were getting ready to leave, they were closing, and they were so nice they make everything fresh daily, and had extra apple and cherry turnovers. I had taken home 1 of each. The next day with a cup of coffee, warmed up,  very good.
I can't wait to come back!
Thank you ladies for such a great experience."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMDhybG1BRRAB,A Google Maps review about a restaurant.,"Fantastic interior layout, private dining area from the bar. My brother and I came here for dinner he was in town and I haven't been here yet so we decided to try it. Food was interesting to say the least, we got the CALABRIAN CHILI CUCUMBERS for an app and it was more tangy like pickled cucumbers. Still very refreshing. I got the SWEET CORN AGNOLOTTI  , charred corn very sweet with shredded crab mix, pretty good however needed a little salt added.
My brother got BRAISED PORK BELLY, cooked an amazin crispy skin , however, this one was overly salted. Not bad but our palette was interesting.
Then we ended with dessert CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE and Seasonal Truffles (3)
By far my favorite I've tried, subtle , flavor isn't overpowering (I don't have that much of a sweet tooth) would definitely get the dessert again! The truffles was alright, dark chocolate and white chocolate. Tasted really nice.
Great experience, menu is seasonal so it's nice to see different options."

We ended up staying at the lower bar and eating a wonderful dinner. Mostly because of our bartender‚Äôs kindness, professionalism and the great ambiance.

Mushroom kushiyaki and charred avocado for a starter. Then, egg yolk raviolo and chicken roulade for our main course. Delicious on all counts.

It‚Äôs set up as a cafe, as well. We didn‚Äôt experience this side of it. But, highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a nice dinner in Bloomington."

They also have a separate room upstairs for a small event or work meeting/lunch. There is a bar both upstairs and downstairs which is neat! Beyond the atmosphere, the food was good and the presentation was great. I had the beet salad which was small but very tasty!

We had made reservations online beforehand, and were seated right away. The service was perfecto and I'm sure we'll be back again in a month or two since there's seasonal menu items.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX1AyLVd3EAE,A Google Maps review about a restaurant.,"I want to begin by saying I really love the atmosphere. The tables are spaced out enough that there is not much noise and it‚Äôs easy to talk to your table. The interior decoration is also very beautiful. There is not much parking but I live close so I walked. The food was delicious but there were just enough weird things that made me give 4 instead of 5 stars. The bread and butter (which is its own appetizer) is OK but definitely not anything to write home about, the butter pat was cold so not easily spreadable. I ordered the cauliflower main dish with sauce and golden raisins knowing it would be lighter than a meat main. However, with the price of the dish, I was expecting a bit more than 1/4 of a cauliflower head for my main meal. I know inflation and prices are high but cauliflower? Seems they could‚Äôve spared a bit more. Additionally the olive oil cake with rhubarb and strawberry ice cream was good but the ice cream stole the show! The cake itself was just ok and the rhubarb had not been sweetened enough to make it palatable, I ended up taking it off. The service was good but not great, we had a new server and she made a few missteps that ultimately would have cost our party money if we hadn‚Äôt spoken up (as opposed to slow service, etc). Overall, I definitely want to go back to the elm, i will just choose my dishes more carefully."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdE9faGN3EAE,A Google Maps review about a restaurant.,"The Elm is beautiful, gorgeous even, and the staff were friendly, attentive and good at their jobs. The menu is big enough that there are enough choices but it's not overwhelming. The cocktail menu is inventive.
I mention all of this because the bar, from the moment you walk in the door, is set very very high. And the food is great. It's just not quite as beautiful as the decor or as perfect as the menu describes.
The tostones are plentiful and the brussel sprouts are crispy. But the sauces leave something to be desired.
The steak and lamb were excellently cooked but greens and asparagus needed a little more flavor.
But hot damn the olive oil cake was good. The seasonal rhubarb, strawberry and pistachio pairing was divine. Textures and flavors, yum!
I'll be back for espresso and dessert ASAP!"

It's like walking into a trendy bar / restaurant in a major city. The cocktails are original and interesting. I ordered the Choconut Negroni and it was unlike anything and I have drunk before. And interesting blend of Jen, cocoa nib infused sweet remove, and coconut fat washed campari, It is entirely original and fun to drink. Next I tried the espresso martini. I've had plenty of those in my lifetime and this one was a new twist. Two different kinds of Espresso and tiramisu liqueur woke me up and provided just the right amount of decadence. I didn't try the menu but it looks excellent. This would be a great place to come with friends or on a date night."

This place has never really been busy since when I used to come here in first place. Poker room barely had 1 to 2 tables open in the past and 1 craps table. Today Poker room is closed for the next few days and craps closed too. One thing I'll say is the Cafe has some pretty good food. Can never go wrong with the burger.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4XzVhMW53RRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Update 2/14/23

Walking up to the main entrance of the casino was worse than before.  Cigarettes are all over,  things need painted and everything could do well with a good powerwashing.  Nothing about this 1st glance gives me ""destination resort"" vibes.    We arrived around 8:30 in the morning so it was obvious this littered mess was not fresh.  If this place wants to pull in new customers and become a major moneymaker,  things need to change.  When your facility is much less clean than the local gas stations,  you have an issue.   Granted,  the inside is clean,  but the outside is what sets the tone.  Do better, Mardi Gras!

Original review:  We have stayed here numerous times through the years.  This last visit was already a letdown due to no pool and none of the amazing breakfast foods.  The room was not the cleanest and the gold fixtures are now chrome and gold due to someone using the incorrect cleaner.  All of the restaurants in the casino were closed and there was no room service.

My suggestions to help would be:

Breakfast:  Since the old buffet style won't work,  the easiest way to serve the delicious hot breakfast would be for each room to put an order in either online or by calling concierge.  Their items would be prepared and could be dropped off contactless outside of the room or could be picked up in the lobby.

Cleaning:  Supervisor checking rooms to make sure they are bring cleaned properly.  They should also be sure to teach proper use of cleaning agents and which products to use on each surface.

Restaurants:  If none of the on site eateries are going to be open,  either offer meals via room service again or at least put together a listing of nearby restaurants and contact information.   Maybe even see if any would be willing to give hotel guests a discount.

I know some of these items seem small but if you want to call yourself a resort and be a destination vacation spot,  you can't overlook the little things."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLb3Fic1BREAE,A Google Maps review about a golf course.,"Really enjoy Wildwood. The course is always in good condition and the prices always seem fair. I play courses that charge more or just as much as Wildwood, but are over crowded and not as pretty. The layout provides variety for the holes. It has a parkland feel that is cut into a hill side. There is only one house that lines the fairway. About half of the holes have an elevated gain at the green or tee box.  It might be a ride for some. If the walk from the first tee box or the walk to the 9th green look steep to you. You have a similar walk about 9 or 10 times. Even though it is right off HWY 30, it is really peaceful on the course."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3bXRtazlBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a golf course.,"Four of us from Honolulu, Hawaii played this course on September 26, 2016 and we absolutely enjoyed the round.  Great staff, course and surroundings. Had previously called Bob to inquire about the course due to the mixed reviews.  Wildwood GC provides exceptional value and we put this course on our play again course whenever we're up here in the Portland area. Our foursome consisted of three Waialae Country Club and one Mid-Pacific Country Club members.  Mahalo Bob for taking great care of us.

Returned to play with some other buddies on May 6, 2017 before heading back to Honolulu the next day after a  five day golfing tour in the greater Portland area.  They were impressed Wildwood is on their ""will play again"" list.  Thanks Tom and the rest of the staff for taking care of us and welcoming us back.  Will be back up there in early-October with the original 2016 Honolulu guys!

PS: Wildwood has great drainage so this is one of three courses we now know that is playable after heavy rains."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJemVqU21nRRAB,A Google Maps review about a golf course.,"Challenging holes are carved out of the hillside along the river at this course to provide something for everyone. First and foremost there is more vertical change at this course than many I have played in the past. Some pin locations are a hundred feet above the tee box while others are the same downhill. This makes it almost a must to rent a cart if you are playing 18, unless you are in peak physical condition.

The clubhouse is big and clean with friendly staff members to help out with your needs. The range is quite short and narrow, only 200 yards max by about 20 yards wide which makes it hard to warm up for the long shots you will need to be successfull right off the first tee. The carts are older and gas powered which made it tricky to get up some if the steep hills and there is some slow play if you are behind the wrong group.

Insider tip: make sure to study the course before you go if you haven't played here. There are hidden creeks and obstacles that ruin great shots down the middle. Better yet, play a practice round so you'll be ready before taking it on!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dXN2ZVRnEAE,A Google Maps review about a golf course.,"Wildwood has it all in the name! It's wild and in the woods. Expect to use a cart or be sore the next day from walking- but those are both great options!

Nestled in the foothills of Forest Park (one of the nation's largest urban pakrs) the gorgeous setting allows unparalleled views. If you find yourself frustrated about your golf game, you can take a moment to see beautiful glimpses Mt. Hood, Mt. St. Helens, and countless other bounties of nature.

Oh yes of course- golf! The course itself is well-maintained, and has its own unique blend of challenges and opportunities. Navigating through a ""normal"" course is challenged in its own rite, but couple that with nestling into the side of a mountain and you have Wildwood!

You owe it to yourself to make the trip out there to enjoy it. You can thank me later!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdlpMcFlBEAE,A Google Maps review about a golf course.,"Just played here on Sunday 10/6, about three weeks post-punching. The greens are fantastic. They're rolling very smooth and true..and at a great speed. They're firm, yet they're holding shots the way they should. Also, the traps were all hand raked, and fairways were very playable.

Look for a new expanded green complex and new lower tee on the par three # 6, and new tee locations on # 7. One thing that always impresses me about Wildwood, is the attention to detail, and the constant reinvestment in the course and clubhouse.

Also, the service is always friendly and accommodating. If you've never played Wildwood, be sure to give it a try. It's a real hidden gem of a golf course, with plenty of interesting holes, lots of character and challenges, and spectacular views.

And finally, Wildwood is in such a peaceful, serene setting, that it has an amazing overall calming impact on my game, as you can see in the photo below, taken at the 15th tee."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bUlpY1FnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Reserved our deluxe king room with jetted tub for Sept 19th back in mid June 2021 & requested a quiet location (if possible). They put us in room 314, which was located on 3rd of 4 floors, right outside of the elevators & across from the ice machine room (very noisy).

The bath towels were thin, rough, and worn (one had two rips on edges... see pics). Jetted tub was the best part of the room, but took forever to fill up. But, for some stupid reason there was NO vent fan in the bathroom! Horrible!

The furnishings were a bit dated & I wouldn't call the size of the king room a ""deluxe"". Reserved that room purely because I knew after a 12 hr drive I'd want to soak in a nice big bath tub. Mattress was comfy, but only 3 squishy pillows (not 4) on the king sized bed (no neck support at all).

I wouldn't pay $172 (after taxes) for another stay in a king sized room there (booked thru Expedia.com). A bit disappointing."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNmJUeGZREAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,We splurged on the King Suite.  It had a bedroom and living room. There were two TVs although the living room TV was small.

No guest laundry.  Incredibly helpful staff.  Several chain restaurants within walking distance.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZaS1lN0RREAE,A Google Maps review about a mexican restaurant.,I am appalled at the quality of service and food at this place. While a family of Mexicans sitting next to us got served like royalty we were put on the back burner the waitress came over a total of three times while we were there. She also loved to flirt with her boss the whole time while ignoring us! We ran out of chips and salsa asked for more and didn't get any until after we got our food. When I got my plate. The portion was so small ! I had maybe 10 tiny pieces of meat and 4 pieces of shrimp on my dish which was the muscle maker . The lettuce was all brown and nasty. The avocado looked rotten. And not just a normal oxidation brown but it looked like it had been sitting and got rotten and they didn't care. Also only got like three slices of avocado. The dish looked nothing like the picture on the menu. I would have sent it back immediately but the waitress ran off and never even came back until it was to bring  the check. I didn't eat a bite of it and they tried to charge me for it until we talked to the manager! His excuse was they were training them. Yeah whatever. Never coming back here again. Waste of money and time.

Putting chain restaurants to shame since opening their doors, this local gem serves up deliciously grande portions of authentic Mexican grub. I ordered the chorizo burrito which doubled as lunch and dinner due to its gigante status. It came with a side of chips and a tasty jalape√±o ranch dressing for dipping. It would have paired beautifully with a cerzeva or two, but I was there for carry out lunch so I laid off the booze until I could come in for a dinner here. Fast service.

The room was clean and spacious. At the Tropicana there are multiple towers there is so much to explore. There are restaurants and shops in the hotel. No need to leave the hotel. There are a few shops open 24/7. Tacos at 2am was perfect. We ate at PF Changs and it was absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was great too. We also ate at Casa taco, Hash house a go go, and many other places as there are so many to pick from. The boardwalk is right outside the marketplace (where most the food shops are). We walked all the way to the end which took about 40 minutes one way. There were many shops closed but also many open and ready for customers. Going on a week day is our preference as there are so many less people. By Thursday alot more  people started coming."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dDR6Wk9BEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"This was my first time at Tropicana Atlantic City. I stayed in the Havana Tower with 1  King size bed.
My first impression--the place is a sprawling monster of a Hotel and Casino resort. From the hotels lobby and check-in located on the lowest level (below the main casino floor accessible by escalators) to my room was a good 10 minute walk. If you have a lot of luggage it's going to be a workout for you. If you can't walk long distances or have any issues getting around, I suggest getting a room closer to the lobby and casino floor. The walk to my room involved many long inclined hallways, a pass through the shops and restaurants in the Quarter  and finally to the Havana Tower.
My room was big and looked very inviting and clean. But upon further inspection, it had it's share of problems. Smudges and  crud and on multiple door jams, and the bathroom vent and the room In-take A/C vent were disgustingly dirty. It looked unhealthy. (See pics)  Not sure if it is mold or just thick black dust but it should be cleaned REGULARLY. Besides that, I wanted to simply relax and take a shower but there was no body wash or hand soap for the sink. I called house keeping and was told they would be sending some up to the room immediately. I waited for over an hour and nothing showed up from housekeeping. Had to call again.  Someone showed up 30 minutes after that. (My stay was on a Wednesday and it took that long to get something that they forgot to put in the room. I can't imagine how long I request, like body wash or simply extra towels, would take on a weekend.
The hotel immenities are a pool and a very impressive  entertainment, shopping and restaurant area called the Quarter. It boasts over 24 restaurants, 25 shops of various goods and 22 bars and clubs and other entertainment like an Escape room.
Overall, despite the bad cleaning and service delays   from the housekeeping department,   I would recommend this hotel."

The room was nice, but my stay was ruined by 2 women fighting in the room next door and slamming their door at 1 am, and then the people in the next room had the same song on repeat for 3 hours.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1M3NTUi13RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"We have been staying at the Tropicana In Atlantic City for over 20 years.  This will be our last stay at the property.  From check in to check out we have never been treated so poorly. The resort is in bad shape. It isn‚Äôt ADA compliant as handrails are missing in the elevators and everything was dirty, as seen in the photos we posted.  At check in we were assigned a room that wasn‚Äôt clean.  There were potato chips all over the floor and the sheets were stained and gross with shoe prints all over the sheets.  We were assigned a new room, but it wasn‚Äôt much better.  There were boogers and blood wiped on the walls, the curtains had holes and the paint was peeling off the walls and headboards.  We had three guests and two towels.  When we requested more towels, housekeeping said we were only allowed two per room.  Two towels for three guests?  Housekeeping never came to our room to empty the trash or make the beds or collect old towels.  The next day we had to call housekeeping to get towels. I called back two hours later, and the gentlemen told me ‚ÄúYeah, I have your slip right here‚Äù and then hung up on me.  The towels never came.  The only time housekeeping came to our room was to rush us to checkout.  By the third day the toilet stopped flushing properly and we had to use the casino restrooms. The hallway during our stay was disgusting and dirty.  The manager on duty couldn‚Äôt be reached.  Ceasar‚Äôs claims they‚Äôve invested 400 million dollars in upgrades, but you will not see any of it in the Trop.  We will be taking our business to another property."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleE9maWtnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"EDIT
9/6 - Responded to owners request to email hotel about experience. I have emailed and hope the hotel will rectify this horrible experience. Will update when they have responded.

9/6 Where do I begin, first do not stay here!!!!!! There is no service and it ruined a birthday weekend trip.

When we arrived in AC we were going to check-in early. Mind you getting to the lobby hotel is a maze in itself with no signage anywhere to tell you where to go. We get to the lobby and there's 20 people and two receptionists along with self check-in machines on the side. I decided to wait. We waited to find out that there was a $25 fee to do so. We thought okay whatever let's do it and we asked if the room we reserved was ready and she said no housekeeping didn't get to it and you'll have to wait until 3pm. So we decided to wait for our room and came back at 3pm. We got our room  and it was not ready. Stains on the pillow cases and sheets and the bathroom with visible hairs everywhere. We called housekeeping 4x and each time they emphasized that requests take up to an hour to be completed. I said weird huh because I've been calling since 3pm and it's 7pm and nothing has been done. So I decided to call expedia for a refund. Expedia gets a manager called Jamal to help us and he says there is the same room ready and clean. So we trusts him and make the change just to find out the room is in the back of the hotel and even dirtier than the first. I had to go back downstairs and request our original room with the view and I would go to the store and buy cleaning supplies myself. The front desk manager was extremely helpful and so nice and helped fixed the situation. I have the emphasized SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE HELPFUL!. And when we moved back to the room it was finally being serviced and cleaned. However, it did take them until 8:30pm to have this completed. They did service the room the next day but at this point the trip was ruined and we checked out.

Save yourself the hassle and go elsewhere.  There's no entertainment, the casino here was dead, and the atmosphere just scummy. We ended up spending most of the following day at the ocean hotel and wished we would have just booked there."

Security is everywhere, and will point you in the right direction. I played roulette and won around $1,300 in 4 hours, went to Hooters downstairs and enjoyed a salad with chicken strips, met some beautiful waitresses, left a nice tip, then headed out with plans of returning soon. They have a convenience store right near the slots and one of the restrooms. The atmosphere was a happy one all night. I'm definitely going back next time I'm in Atlantic City."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNUktaTZ3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"First off I've stayed at the Tropicana before but in the Chelsea tower. I had a great experience the last time I was here. This time I stayed in the west tower and I felt like I was sleeping in a motel. First off,it took three tries to get into the room. Then I noticed the security lock on the door was the old fashioned slide lock. Then there was mold and rust on the ceiling and wall of the bathroom. The room needed a serious facelift. There was torn wallpaper, holes in the dresser where the previous tv was and the climate control was ancient.
Granted I could have asked for a new room but I was tired and didn't want to move. I did complain and they gave me a $50 food voucher and extended checkout.
Next time I stay in the Tropicana, I'll make sure my room isn't in the west tower."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaVByTlN3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I just want to make sure, that my review will be about the hotel, not casino. Casino is actually nice and big, so you will have a lot of fun there. Let me start with the reason why we stood in Trop. It was our anniversary and we wanted to go to see our favorite DJ in Harrah‚Äôs. We are reward members, so we get comp rooms in both of these hotels plus Caesars, unfortunate all the rooms were sold out a months before our stay, so we decided to stay in Tropicana for our first time. We didn‚Äôt know, that the tower, that we picked was not renovated. We paid almost $400 for one night stay and we got old room with dirty chairs, broken safe and alarm clock, broken light in the bathroom and dirt all over. You can see it on the pictures. We called to the reward center and lady just forgot about us on the phone, so we went downstairs to see what was our options. We were ready to pay extra just to move to the nicer room. Lady in the reception helped us, she moved us to a suite in the same tower with no additional charge, but despite everything a new room wasn‚Äôt better than the previous one. Suite also was old, couches with stains, broken things all over, but we were happy about working safe and comfy beds. So my biggest advice, check the towers before stay, if you are not sure, call them and ask. Or better stay in Harrahs or Caesars for chipper and with renovated rooms.  2 stars for trying to resolve our issue and a good custom service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMTlXOHhnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Our trip was booked several weeks prior to our arrival. The self check in booths were declining many booked hotel guests, stating our rooms weren‚Äôt ready and they‚Äôd emhoyelus when it was. It was alr 6pm, and the kiosks weren‚Äôt accurate! The lines after the mass confusion and frustration began and lasted beyond an hour and some for others, with less than minimal staff at the desk to accommodate the error. This is unacceptable.
Mind you, we are here with my step daughter for a cheer competition, so there are many parents and elementary aged and younger children filling this lobby waiting for resolution.
After we‚Äôre able to get checked in, we come up to our room in the west wing‚Ä¶ seriously the most ghetto room I‚Äôve ever stayed in. I would never have anticipated a casino hotel room to be in such dated/dirty/and sloppy conditions. Bathroom is filthy, tub/shower walls stained and smells like cigarette. Cigarette burn hole in bed linen, and the paint job looks like it was done by my grandchildren. The coffee maker is broken and filthy with thick calcium buildup. There isn‚Äôt a dresser to put our clothes away. Mold in the shower molding.
The pictures on your website do NOT portray an image of the trash hole we walked into last night! We‚Äôre beyond disappointed, and have never had an experience as poor as this at any casino we‚Äôve gone to before. I plan on calling the front desk this morning for some kind of resolution.
Addendum‚Ä¶ step daughter just showed us a used band aid in her bed üò£
Spoke with management yesterday, they returned our phone call after 9 hours, offered us a different room today, however, it‚Äôs after 2pm and the room just now is ready. The replacement coffee maker and clean linen by the folded lump sum came up after several phone calls after 10:30 pm last night.
Manager stated this casino sleeps whatever sum of people and it‚Äôs difficult to keep up and please everyone. Change of room without a guaranteed time and a $50 food and beverage voucher for one of their places within the casino doesn‚Äôt make this stay worth the money I‚Äôve spent at this casino!
I plan on calling management again tonight or tomorrow, I will update. Hopefully it‚Äôs better than the less than interested game they‚Äôve shown so far."

At the casino, drink service at the table games is SOOOO slow and a soda if you go get your own is $5. There should be drink rounds at least every hour, not 3 hours.
Valet service is super slow so give yourself time.

But that should not be why the rooms aren‚Äôt clean and in many aspects unacceptable. I did not complain to hotel staff but I would never expect to walk into a room with spills on the walls and broken faucets. If this was not for a celebration weekend, I would have left. Staff was nice, location is fine. Elevators for the west tower are awful on weekends. 4 elevators to get all guests to their rooms for that tower - there was always a line and wait. At times we had to take the stairs after 15 minutes of not being able to get an elevator. I would not recommend to stay at this hotel - we paid approx $370/night and I was quite shocked at what this hotel thinks is acceptable.

Issues:

For blackjack fans: dealer hits on soft 17s.

Service is less than good. Front desk was manned by one person for a 40 person queue. It looked like a line at an airport. Employees can be pretty bossy too.

Listed amenities are more like ""services you can purchase"" or ""sometimes available"". To the extent that you have to pay $35 or buy a $200 massage to get access to the hot tub for a day. So don't think you can go relax at it with $$$. And it's only available on certain days. I also think you have to rent a chair at the outdoor pool if you want to sit at it? The indoor pool is only available on certain days, and is by reservation.

Some games have seriously reduced payouts. Example, a side bet at blackjack has payouts nearly cut in half compared to what other casinos run the same bet at.

As others have mentioned, the hotel and casino are dated and show it. It gives the impression that things are just being kept as is. No serious upkeep since what seems like a long time ago.

Strengths:
The resturaunt selections are pretty nice, but on the pricey side. I'd recommend the Petitie Creperie in the quarter for an affordable, pleasant meal. They have a wide selection of interesting crepes and other breakfast foods.

My room in the south tower was pretty nicely kept and seemed modernish. The shower was modern and high quality.

Will continue to update this as things progress."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcElYNmVBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,Very nice casino..... very nice location only thing I didn't like was that I had 100 celebration credit for my diamond status so I got dinner on Saturday evening and thinking I could get  something and heat it up in microwave like any other casino I've stayed at has microwaves but no had no microwave so had to use hair dryer to heat up food both times and wasn't great.  Plus room where stayed in at room above and next door was very loud kept up all night long... Machines was tighter than Fort Knox for the weekend when they had a promotional weekend flight come in. If wanted to waste 2500 on tight machines could've stayed in cherokee and not had just a ok time. You would think they would have gave some promo cash away to guest also. Took card out n started winning Lil but as usual put back in what won.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobmFQSThBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Used to love staying at Tropicana. The new food options are good but everything else is sub par. Stayed this time in the Chelsea tower and despite how nice the walkway is to get there, the rooms are gross. Smelled like mildew and the blankets, light shades and table were all stained. The curtains looked like they had blood stains all over them.  The windows were wet and the wallpaper peeling off. The carpet was not clean in the room or hallways. It‚Äôs dark n dingy in the hallways. Plus you can always add an additional hour and half to check-in and get out of the parking garage."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOTk3Q25nRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"My policy is to only post positive reviews. So Atlantic City is a tough one for me. I decided to post because even though the streets around the Casino area are rough around the edges it's a place you should probably visit at least once and decide for yourself. The city has a ""once was glamorous"" feel, but now seems neglected and in need of a Facelift (see pics).
The Tropicana itself seems well managed and trying to bounce back from the pandemic.  The building is older, but my room was fine. Only a few of the restaurants are open and one inside pool.
The ventilation system allowed a hint of cigarette smell you find at casinos.  It seems if you stayed inside the building you could forget the neglected vibe outside.  Come see for yourself!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlZ3ZMN1V3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"The Trop is usually my go to in AC because there are tons of food options and multiple bars with happy hour deals. After this visit I may be looking for a new destination. Service was absolutely terrible throughout the entire casino. Every drink ordered AR a slot machine came out wrong, then the waitresses argued with me that they brought what I ordered. Some weren't even close. I ordered a rum and coke and they brought me a beer instead. Food was delicious every place we ate, but again terrible service and only had 2 meals in 4 days that came out correct the first time.  Housekeeping was another nightmare. We called at 9am Sunday to request service. We were out all day and no one came to clean, bring fresh towels etc. We called again and the desk told us someone would be there in an hour. We came back after dinner and the garbage was not taken, towels not taken, bed not made, and a pile of new towels and soap left on the bed. The next morning Housekeeping walked in without knocking. We told her it has ok and she could clean the room but she left and never came back. Had to call the desk for toiletries and again no one came. Day three we put the do not disturb sign on and Housekeeping knocked on the door for 10 minutes until I got up and answered. They asked if we wanted service. We had also asked for extra pillows when we checked in...I just checked out on day five and still no pillows. This was my only vacation this year, and stupid little things like this add up and make it hard to enjoy. While Caesars and Harrahs have less options for food and are smaller, my experiences there have been much better."

My phone wrong 2 days in a row at 6:30 a.m. even though I didn't have a wake up call.
If it's windy the 41st floor has something banging all night outside the building.

Finding the self parking lot was a major challenge.

The signs for the lobby are not very good. I had to use a self check in kiosk.

The casino area was good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyb2V6cHJRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"The Tropicana shares a reputation for being the ultimate affordable getaway. Instead what it provided was a terrible first experience. It was not what I expected at all. It took us almost an hour and a half to figure out where my room was, then when I finally got there it was outdated and sub-par.There was no one to offer anyone a guide to navigating the huge property. The kiosks are supposed to provide a map emailed at Check in and one was never received. When we finally got a hold of someone, they did change the room and for that I am thankful. However what was supposed to be a relaxing mid week getaway was a poor experience."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdE1fU2NREAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"It was comparable in price to other hotel casinos in the area like Bally‚Äôs and we booked as a group for a trip for a conference so it was busy. However when we arrived for check in at our 5+ reserved rooms they claimed they only had one room, over an hour later we were in the west tower (not on the boardwalk and very cheaply made).
The casino and hotel offer a lot, there‚Äôs even a little Havana theme with palm trees in the hallways and cobblestone streets. The rooms were very noisy (I could hear everyone around me) cheap small tv old curtains one thin blanket and two sheets on the bed only. No air or temp control and the shower took over 30 minutes to get hot.
I‚Äôm addition the room was a bit worn; peeling wallpaper paint stains, no metal fittings on sprinklers, dirty shower curtain. We made it work, but I wouldn‚Äôt go back."

The walls had black drippings rolling down the entire room walls. Maybe water stains but it was yucky! I had a double bed room . The water burned my skin and is difficult to get it to the right temperture. My phone fell and upon pulling the beds  out i saw so much yuck which explains why my allergies were all over the place. The tv was dusty. Towels had burn marks and more. Not to mention I had a groupon that states the promotional value never expires. But everyone acted like they had no idea what i was presenting in front of them so I never got to use it. One supervisor said ""hang tight we are starting another groupon soon"". Just sad!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNha3ZIVmZnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I paid 400 dollars for a room in the west tower on a Friday night.  The room was clean but in need of fixing and updating.  My room, the floor, the elevators all smelled like pot in a nonsmoking room and floor.
I had to change my room at 1 am because the noise from the room next door was so loud and they were blasting music.
We spent the day at the cabana five pool deck bar.  It was beautiful. Food was good and service was ok.  Too many guests, not enough waitresses.  I bought reserved loungers for 25 each which was worth it. The cabana was not worth it based on what I could see.  I would stay again just because of the pool bar but I would stay in the cabana towers. It's new and removed from the other areas of the hotel."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN1lURWNnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Stayed at the north tower with my boyfriend back in September. There was a horrible storm those two days so couldn‚Äôt venture around AC much but we still had a lot of fun as there is plenty of things to do in the resort.

Room/cleanliness: I‚Äôm a smoker (horrible- I know) so I appreciated there being smoking rooms and smoking areas in the casino so I didn‚Äôt need to go out in the wind & rain just to have a smoke.
The room was in a convenient location. Right above the casino and near the elevators. Our window view was overlooking the casino which was pretty cool. The furniture was a little dated and the cleaning was ehh but that‚Äôs pretty much the case with all smoking rooms in any hotel/resort.

Casino: clean. I saw several employees doing detailed cleaning while playing the slots.

Parking: If staying in the North tower, I recommend using the valet. It was very convenient and the charge for it wasn‚Äôt much.

Staff: no complaints about the Tropicana staff. All very friendly and helpful.

Location: perfect location to the boardwalk and beach. I definitely recommend The Rain Forest Cafe located on the boardwalk.

My only 2 complaints (one was my fault).
1.  was our experience at Hooters there. From the moment we walked in the door, the waitress was very rude. Maybe she was having a bad day but it seemed like she took one look at us and assumed we wouldn‚Äôt tip well (we tip a standard 20-30% (depending on service which I think is very fair). We were nothing but kind to her but she was still extremely rude. The other waitress walking around seemed delightful, I wish she was our waitress instead.
Complaint 2: we went during the week days in the fall so the pools weren‚Äôt open. That‚Äôs my bad for not seeing that in their website. So if you want to use a pool, double check the pools are open.
I think all the bad reviews were from people expecting it to be a five star hotel. Most said there wasn‚Äôt much signage for locations but if you look up, there are signs with arrows pointing where to go.

Over all, we had a great time and definitely plan to be back soon! Thank you for helping making our vacay a good one!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMnFfckZnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"We stayed on the north side, the pictures and the actual room where different. Then they had to move us to another room because there was mold around the vent. They moved us to a bigger room, somewhat but this was our first time staying. Overall it's was busy through out the whole casino, I'm guessing because people are getting back out. All an all not outside of the mold, we couldn't complain too much, we only paid $65 for the whole weekend. 5/7/2022 We stayed in the Havana Tower, rooms are decent, closer to all the action. The buffet is still closed but the food selections are on point, again for $74 for the weekend can't complain. 10/24/22 Did another weekend stay new restaurants are on point, something different BBQ, sushi, remodel PF Changs and breakfast brunch spot. The buffet is completely gone."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeU12VFFREAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I feel the biggest pro for Trop is that it is one of the best casinos for food options. Lots of different types of places like Chickie & Pete's, Palm, Carmine's, etc. The casino is decent and clean although my wife was disappointed with no Monopoly or goldfish slots (that we saw).

The room we had was pretty outdated but spacious. You can hear people next door, at least from the room we had.

We waited probably 25 mins in line Friday early evening (6:30pm) to check in. The self check-in didn't work for us so we then had to wait for a person which was another line. Expect to wait, especially on the weekend. The only major con was leaving Sunday. The parking garage was backed up all the way to the top. It was crazy. Probably close to an hour to get out.

All said, I still feel it is one of the best options in Atlantic City. It's an option for us now that it is Caesar's Rewards. We will probably stay again in the future but I know the wife will probably prefer Caesars if it's available and reasonably priced."

We found 2 stubs of cigarettes on the ground, it's like they sweeped and put it behind the drawer between the beds, there was someone elses hair in the shower (cause it was red and no one in my family has red hair) it reeks of cigarettes, probably because of the stubs. I've been here before in the north tower and it wasnt like this. The west tower needs more care. Only reason why I'm not leaving until my check out day is cause I already paid a lot of money for this, but I'm quite disgusted and disappointed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOVkzSnZ3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"So far, not so good. Self check-in kiosk put us in a double when we reserved a king. Currently waiting in line in the South Tower Lobby, a long walk from the Havana Tower where we were, for assistance in rectifying the situation.  We have already had to change our dinner reservation at Ossu. I will update once we are settled. Not getting better: only 1 person working the counter. People behind us have been waiting for an email that their room is ready for an hour. Wow.
8:30 and Gary is now helping us. ""The Kiosk wouldn't make a mistake. Whatever room you booked is the one you got.""
Except it's not the one we booked and, oh look, we have the confirmation.
""Well, if a king bed is important to you,I can put you in the North Tower. ""
Yes, since it is what we booked, we'd like the king.
So, we're in the king on the 17th of the North Tower. It's fine. Smells vaguely of cigarettes and marijuana, but it's  AC so... We may make our new reservation at 9.
I'll update tomorrow,  but at this point, my advice is avoid this property.

Good morning. Final update: The bed is pretty soft, but would be fine if there was any substance to the pillows, or if there were more pillows (4 small ""feather"" pillows on a king bed with no extras in the closet).
The temperature was impossible to regulate to any satisfaction. See the picture of the 70's technology thermostat.
The shower looked beautiful, however the design is awkward and it functions poorly.

We come to AC plenty and took a chance on the ""New"" Tropicana on this visit. This was a mistake.  Stay somewhere else. Hard Rock was fine, Ocean was lovely, Golden Nugget was really good, and Borgata and The Water Club are wonderful."

The beds were extremely comfortable and spacious. You may need to call for a blanket if you enjoy your room below 65. The north tower was closest to the marketplace. My mom and I loved it, as it took us 1 minute to get to the breakfast and food section. The quarter isn‚Äôt too far, but we loved our stay and flight. We have already booked another trip. I wish we did have the north tower again, but I didn‚Äôt mind exploring the other tower's benefits. Please visit, and wear your walking shoes or chunky heels. This hotel is lovely, full of great people, and has too much fun for a short stay. In addition to that, visit the Hash House of Go-Go and get Yvette. She‚Äôs a genuinely unique waitress. I promise you won‚Äôt regret the meals or air drinks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MzVhTGJnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Disclaimer: This review is for the Casino Hotel only not the rooms. We visited on a weekday during the last week of July. We really liked the Havana inspired decor of Tropicana AC- it is clean and the casino does not have a strong smell of cigarette which is a plus for me. It has many different shops and restaurants to choose from. Also, close to the boardwalk but this one is close to the far end side not the one near Steel Pier (if you‚Äôre planning to go with kids). Tropicana AC does have an indoor arcade (Family Fun Station located in the North Tower) as per their website but we didn‚Äôt get to visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtc1pIWVZBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Beautiful place
Lots to do
They even have an arcade for the kids
Plenty of restaurant choices
Can't believe how big the place is.
It's like the size of a city. Lol
Ocean view
We stayed on the 65th floor.
We could see the whole city , the beach and the ocean.
Shout out to the staff !
They were very helpful and friendly."

It doesn‚Äôt help that you have abandoned casinos in AC. It‚Äôs an absolutely EYESORE. Some areas of the casino are starting to show its age, but others as you see in the photo still look good.  If I were a betting man, I would say AC will be down to rubbish in the next 10 -20 years unless these crooked AC politicians get serious about investing in AC.

My room proximity to the Casino was great. Very pleased with the North Tower. Once I figured out, how to get to the 5üåüGilchrist for breakfast. It was during that walk, in the early mornings. I had the chance to observe the Cleaning Crews, and their attention to detail. Hand rails, escalators, elevators, corners of window sills, spotless. . .

ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRcjRVQhAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"For entertainment and dining this place is great, but do NOT stay in the West tower unless you're trying to save a few bucks.

Entertainment: Casino is vast, table games are plenty (enough) and the sportsbook is big.

Check in: they have many electronic kiosks, but they seemed clunky. Many people were having issues that required help, including us. They'll help did come quickly.

Rooms: We suggest not staying in West. Beds were okay. Bathroom is big. But the walls were scuffed/marked like a children's playroom. There is no carpeting, just vinyl floor which makes it a bit cold, (and more importantly louder above you.) If you do get a West tower room, request as far from the elevators as possible (you want the last two digits of your room number to be as high as possible, definitely above 25).

If you love 80s bathroom fixtures, and showers that whistle like tea kettles, then you'll love West. Haha.

Do not even think of trying to get an elevator near checkout time. After waiting five minutes, we took the stairs from the 45th floor and there were so many taking the stairs you'd think it was an evacuation.

Not a horrible room, and it was a few bucks cheaper, but had we'd known, we definitely would've paid more to be anywhere except West.

Parking: Extremely reasonable at only $10 for Saturday and Sunday night, and our check-in gave us a $5 voucher. So $5 total for 2 days of parking? Fabulous. There is no need to pay for valet."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbmRDWC1nRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Didn‚Äôt stay at the hotel, but visited the casino to gamble. Feels very outdated, but service was still great. Loved the fireworks at 10pm that they have every Saturday! ‚ú®"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtb3FyeHF3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Be aware that unless you book directly through the Tropicana hotel (website), you're more likely working with a booking agency (not directly affiliated with the Tropicana Hotel) and you won't  know the total cost of the room until you check in at the hotel.

Your room is subject to taxes and fees (TOURISM FEE/TAX 2; CASINO FEE/TAX 2; A.C. OCC SURCHARGE/TAX 2; RESORT FEE/TAX 2) that booking agents don't disclose when you make and pay for your reservation (a least ours didn't).

These additional fees and taxes increased the cost of the 2-night stay from $92.70 to $184.01.

While the final cost may not be outrageous, it is certainly (at twice the listed nightly rate) more than you expected when you booked the room.

In addition to that, our booking agent charged only $50 (of the total cost of our stay) to my credit card at the time of booking, leaving the remaining balance to be paid at check-in. And the reservation was not confirmed for the section of the hotel whee we prefer to stay.

Our room was cold both nights but after a 'jump start', it started to warm up a bit (recycling regularly on it's own for the 1st time since we arrived). Annoying, yes. But not worth relocating or having to wait for someone from maintenance to show up and address the problem. The room was clean, good sized, uncarpeted, poorly lit (and heated) with just a desk, one lonely desk chair, a safe and mini fridge (that whined) and no microwave.

Spacious bathroom with pull bars in the tub/shower but only one hook to hang things on (towels, PJ's, wash cloths or anything else).

Parking is NOT FREE, but it's reasonable.

As long as you know what to expect when you book, you can relax and enjoy the place. It would be nice, I think, if Jersey lawmakers would require these booking agencies to disclose their status and all of the additional costs when they take your call."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eDdXZHJRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I would love to give this place 5 stars except check out and getting out of the parking lot took almost 2 hours. It's ridiculous, they need to take a better look at ways to resolve these issues. The only way to catch an elevator to get you downstairs was to ride up to the top floor and come back down to get to the lobby. Long lines to get out and was very discouraging. The rooms were beautiful spacious and clean. However, if I state there will be 4 people checking in there should be a minimum of 4 towels in the room."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5Nk43VTd3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"So, if I paid specifically to have an ocean view room, should my rate be adjusted to be proportional to the ocean view I have?

Getting to the front desk is rather difficult. There is no clear direction from parking to the front desk. I wandered for about 20 minutes with many employees pointing me in different directions (no signs). Finally an employee from an adjoining hotel walked me to the desk.

I booked the room online and chose the 'pay now' option so as to not get hidden fees and make check-in quick. Be advised, your card will end up with two holds for both the first night and the entire amount.

The room was spacious and clean and housekeeping was prompt and courteous.

The comedy show is a must!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyX2ZUb1F3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,Loving coming here! They installed these Roulette tables that are my favorite. I enjoy playing roulette but don‚Äôt like how rowdy the table can get sometimes. Sitting here you‚Äôre in your own little space and it‚Äôs great.

The rooms were very clean despite the fact that it was a smoking room it smelled really fresh and clean. They are also very spacious and the beds are very comfortable. 24 hour casino is a plus for the gamblers. There are plenty of stores and places to eat around the hotel. It is a huge hotel so if it's your first time prepare to get a bit lost to find the check in desk.

We had drinks at the Saloon and the tequila bar downstairs.  The nachos at the tequila bar were incredible!  Get it with the chicken.  You won't be disappointed!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeTRuV2tBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Pros: The hotel itself is great. Kiosk‚Äôs located throughout the hotel allow the guests to check out really easily. Great food and entertainment options. Valet is $35 and you get your car back in under 10 minutes. Fireworks at night. Great casino.

Cons: Check in desk had 2 staff members for a line of 15+ groups needing to check in. Kiosks would redirect you to the check in desk. From waiting in line to finally getting my room keys was about 45 minutes. Not all the rooms have a nice view but it‚Äôs give in take: view of a parking garage but located next to a lot of dining/shopping options. The room was fairly dirty. During COVID it would be nice to have a little extra cleaning. Especially with the $35 a night ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù that is charged. Trash left from the prior guest, stains on the sheets, hair in the drain, oily hair dryer, stains on the wall, and dusty room should not be an acceptable condition. Water or drain from bathroom sink had a funny smell. Umbrella rental is $20 for the beach-you can buy an umbrella for that much at one of the souvenir stands off the boardwalk.

Overall, hotel is great. Rooms could use more work. Staff is friendly."

Check-out was Sunday and it was a nightmare getting back to the parking garage‚Äîthere was a line of 40+ people just waiting for the elevator to get to their cars.

CASINO: The casino area looks remodeled and I really like the ambiance here‚Äîhas an energetic vibe.  But it‚Äôs crowded so I had trouble finding a blackjack table with open seats.  There‚Äôs a lot of food and bar options in Tropicana which is great!  And on Saturday nights, they have fireworks outside in the boardwalk around 10pm that‚Äôs worth checking out!"

We declined and was told we‚Äôd get our $299 refunded.  The casino itself was nice, clean and not as noisy as the Hard Rock Casino (playing loud music 24/7).

While I was trying to rest people above me must have been moving furniture then someone next to me kept knocking on the wall.

We called the concerige and went to the front desk for assistance. We were told that they can send someone to spray the room and we can probably move to another room the next day.  The manager did not come out of the office to address our concern, so we checked out and went to the Sheraton Hotel.  We were trying to check out the view, but the windows were filthy.  First time and last time at the Tropicana Hotel. We would love to speak to the owner regarding our concerns."

The facilities have very nice and clean showers, and a commons room you can gather in for a game. The road is close and busy through the day, but traffic dies off through the evening and it is very peaceful."

I absolutely agree with other reviews that the road noise is significant and that site #14 is only appropriate for a smaller RV.  We were able to back into #14 with a 20' trailer, I cannot imagine doing it with anything larger. It seemed that several of the concrete pads were not level, we noticed an RV with both of its front tires off the ground after being leveled. We enjoyed kayaking but found strong and irregular currents in front of the PUD building. We didn't notice any real beach, but maybe the tides were off while we were there. We were able to launch kayaks from the bottom of some rock steps. It's a great spot, really well kept and we will be back!"

My first impression wasn't bad at first. It was very beautiful when we walked in. A little confusing because you choose if you'd like to eat in the Diner or Pub and each menu was a tad different (as they did show us) but I was still confused so I just said Diner so we could get to eating. After about a 20 minute wait we was finally placed into a corner but at this point I didn't care, I was just ready to eat. We ordered our drinks and appetizers, those took about 15 minutes to receive. I immediately noticed that the glass was dirty, still at this point I'm trying to stay positive. I calmly wait as we wait for our waiter to come back so I can express my concerns to him unfortunately he took about 20 minutes before he came back in that 20 minutes we watched others get drinks numerous times and their food as we still set there waiting to just get one more drink, at this point I'm getting annoyed. Right about then a manager walk by and I expressed my concerns to her and she immediately address the issue. We finally receive our food from our original waiter and to be honest the burger was okay it didn't have much flavor at all but at this point I'm still trying to stay positive and look at the positive like at least the fries are good right? Just overall not a good experience I don't think I would ever go back there again the manager however did come up to us and offer us a free dessert to take home and we kindly took it home with us to enjoy later. Not the best experience for me the food was very pricey and definitely not worth the money."

Just go in winter rather than a sunny summer day. Can't go wrong with the Traverse Bay Salad with chicken added.

TIP: BBQ Meatball appetizer in a pewter cup"

Writing a review is a pain in the toto. I avoid it as much as possible. But this place deserves it.

There is a reason why this place is still #1:

- The bar section is nice a quiet.
- Their alcohol selections are thoughtful. There are 2 non-alcoholic beers. There is a local Michigan vodka, etc.
- I asked the server about a strange looking bottle and she got me a sample. How sweet.
- The food options are incredible.

This place is something else. You must come visit."

We do miss the mini doughnuts. That was always a tradition, to eat doughnuts while we ride the train. Also, hoping the gift shop gets some monkeys similar to what lives in the zoo. They are a must see and we would love to have a little plush as a memento.
Buy the annual pass, once is never enough when it comes to The Dakota Zoo!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3emZHcEVREAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"It was a very nice Zoo. Small but with a lot to see. We got to see raccoons up close and you could buy food to feed them and other animals throughout the park, like the groundhog in the photo. They have lots of animals to see. We even saw a white tiger sleeping on top of an outpost and a Bangel tiger too. The white tiger was a sleep. The cost to get in was $9 each which isn't bad. We went on our anniversary in August. Which was very nice warm and not a lot of ppl there. You should stop in and see this place. Only reason I didnt give it a 5 star was because I thought they should've had more places opened in the park to get something to eat or drink."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcDktUGJBEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Visited from out of town and spent family time at the Dakota Zoo.

I'm used to bigger zoos that are very crowded and the animals are 20 feet away.  I was expecting to see animals I see at my home zoo; I was wrong.  The variety and habitats of the animals is fun and interesting.

The zoo was not crowded.  My family could wander around at their own pace.  The zoo is very well covered by trees which provide shade in many places.  The paths are a bit run down, but fine for wheelchairs and strollers.  We did not have a map of the zoo which made it confusing to me.  My daughter knew her way around and there are info signs periodically to show the exhibit locations.

I did not see many food stands that I'm used to in bigger zoos.  I think everything is near the entrance.  There is a petting zoo at the entrance as well."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDb2ZDODNRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"For a view of Mount Shasta, this place was one of the best in town. It was centrally located, within walking distance to most of the restaurants in town. The rooms itself could use some freshening up, not really outdated, just looked a little tired. Couldn't tell if the refrigerator in the room was working, didn't seem to get particularly cold and there was no adjustment. The restaurant was good but do yourself a favor and DO NOT PURCHASE THE PRE PAID BREAKFAST PACKAGE. They charge you $20 per person for breakfast. You get your choice of one entree and one drink. My wife ordered the Granola and coffee and wanted a bagel. She was told that she would have to pay extra for the bagel even though the total with the bagel wasn't over $20. You're better off paying as you go because you don't get the difference if your total is under $20. Staff was friendly and helpful. Overall, our stay was ok, I'd stay here again if I were in town but I wouldn't pre pay for breakfast again.

Just got a response from Best Western. They state that their breakfast package are $10 for adults and $5 for children. Going through Bookings.com we were charged $20 per person. Our total for breakfast for the 5 days we were there was $200. I will say breakfast was good but not $200 good. And at no time were our meals over $20 but we didn't get the difference back"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMUpHWHBnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Fantastic location for a short trip around Mt. Shasta.

Our first ever stay here. There are cheaper lodges too in the area but our risk appetite was limited, hence went for this one with higher security and better arrangement in terms of breakfast and room quality.

I just wish they could have provided housekeeping service too since we spent more than just one night. I remember how during pre-covid times the hotel rooms in any place used to be cleaned and well arranged each day by the time you were back. Miss that luxury!

Breakfast isn't a buffet. That also surprised me. They have a standard list of 6-7 entres and you have to choose your breakfast from it. Us being vegetarians had limited options and repeated the same thing the next day. It was, however, delicious. Lovvvedd the hot chocolate with whipped cream.

If there had been fruits, bread, juices, muffins and things like that as a buffet I could have adjusted the quantity and variety."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLOWNPWUNnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Nice grounds an a clean room and bathroom but that's about it.  The shower in the morning was only like warm... very disappointing. The bed was old and brokendown or just incredibly soft and very uncomfortable with small very LUMPY pillows. Worst night of sleep on the trip.
The restaurant is a bit old and the furniture is pretty broken down. I sunk into my seat about 3 inches! The food was pretty disappointing too...medium steak (at over $30!) Came out cold and raw. Could not send it back because the ONE server was completely overwhelmed with tables. That said...her service and attitude considering the situation was incredible! She really tried very hard to get to everyone.
It's probably a great place to being kids...nice outdoor courtyards between the buildings and little waterfalls.  There is an indoor pool that looked pretty decent.
With all the disappointment aside, the staff at this hotel is just...WOW!  From the front desk to the maintenance and housekeeping folks...every one of them was super friendly, kind and professional!"

If your looking for a mountain lodge feeling, this is the place! Conveniently located with only about a 20 minute drive to Mt Shasta Ski Park. They DO NOT have the traditional free breakfast, however they do have a restaurant onsite. Also have a bar and grill. Food is a little spend but good, as expected for hotel restaurants. They were short staffed but the waitresses did their best and were very polite and accommodating. We decided to stay an extra night on a holiday weekend and while booked, the manager Joe pulled through for us and got us an extension. All of the staff work hard and are very polite. Hopefully some hotel upgrades/remodels are planned for the near future. If you plan to stay, suggest you book early, this is the go to for skiers and hikers and it fills up fast!"

The entrance area is beautiful for a Best Western, the dining area is huge.
There are stores, a gas station and Chase bank right across the street.
There a a few restaurants around as well and plenty of places to walk your dog.

LOVE LOVE the Best Western Tree House! Will stay again!

Loved the cabin-esque feel with the high ceilings.

It was great that you could get to the lobby and restaurant all internally.

Great views of the snow capped mountains from our window.

Great prices at the restaurant but there weren't menus readily available. Nice diner to sit down to eat.

Close enough to popular attractions like Burney Falls and McCloud Falls.

Rooms with external door and kitchenette options available.

Felt safe here.

Ryan was great at check in.

Cons:
Pricey but better than all the other hotels around.

Heating/Cooling system didn't work very well.

Pool and hot tub closed due to Covid.

No free breakfast."

First time in Puero Penasco! So walking from the Condo to the beach was just a few mins so close by the beach. Our view was amazing & breathtaking! The resort pools we absolutely loved and enjoyed. They have the kid family pool area which is impressive cause they have really cool slides and shallow area for littles. Plus offer his eats and antojitos while swimming and lounging. The resort has zero tolerance for partying too late and loud obnoxious ppl will be addressed or kicked out so I like that too. Definitely booking this place again!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bV9pS2l3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"This was a great condo & beach facilities. We went on the jet ski, had pi√±a coladas, swam in the pool, cooked breakfast in the room and slept comfortably in the bed. There were four of us on a very roomy 2 bedroom with beautiful views on the 9th floor. We didn‚Äôt get to use other amenities as we were only there for 24 hours but we will venture back. Please keep in mind the border in that area closes at 8pm SHARP from the Arizona side so get there with plenty of time for a line up. Also ‚Äî watch out for sand storms in the area, we encountered one and it was a doozy that would have been very uncomfortable if we weren‚Äôt already in the taxi! The surrounding area is not very interesting, more of a resort oceanfront experience then a sightseeing adventure. Good for a contained group of friends or family. The ocean was gorgeous though, warm and salty!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNnVUYkx3EAE,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"Great place, semi family with a little adult on the side. Has walkout villas which we stayed in and condos. Villa -10 is personally owned and configured differently but has same layout as other villas. Huge tall living, large baths, large rooms. Lots of space inside. Sit on a Lawn chair and and do activities on the turf grass out back. They provide most everything but would recommend more toilet paper, sand chairs per person, shade if you want it. How you rocky point - bring loads of food, prepare with a Costco run, condiments and snacks and good food. Then mess up the dinner plans by instead of preparing it, go into town for tacos."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPZ2FlanFBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"Three days before arriving, we were informed that the condo we booked was sold. My wife called and spoke to Rodrigo. He accommodated us with a stay in 2 different locations 2 days each. The initial location was larger than our original reservation and had the smell of musk and mold. I didn't complain to the front desk because we were moving locations in two days. The second location was smaller than our original reservation. Here for an event that we didn't want to miss, so we made do. Special thanks to Rodrigo for helping us with our stay so we could attend the event we booked our stay for. Photos are of moon lit sea at sandy beach."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXckttWVlBEAE,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"Ummm I probably wouldn‚Äôt come here because of the security, they were super strict, couldn‚Äôt do much but then again it‚Äôs their job, but they made us feel uncomfortable. We booked on Expedia which then brought me to Virbo and I had to create an account and the owners name is Tom. It was a little confusing but figured it out.
The apartment was very spacious and clean,to bedrooms and a set of bunk beds, it had everything you need such as laundry soap, condiments, utensils, plates etc. So we were able to grocery shop for the week.
When you go to the pool, the kiddie pool is not warm and there is an adult pool for night. The beach is beautiful but there is always a low tide so you will have to walk a little to get to the water.
The town is not fully developed, so don‚Äôt expect a Cancun experience but you will find authentic Mexican food when you drive into the town.
In the tourist area of Puerto Penasco, they sell very expensive souvenirs, charging in American prices. Don‚Äôt forget to try the Oyster farm! 100 pesos for one dozen oysters"

But our last outing here a women jumped a curb and went into the spectators fence.  The women was very rude about how it was handled. She was more worried about the fence than to make sure if the woman was okay. She was just overall rude. She also cut out session short due to the incident.

Overall I would still recommend coming here. It is a blast and accidents happen. The carts are fast and general environment is fun. They just need to work on a few employees customer service"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBNTQ2TVRnEAE,A Google Maps review about a sushi restaurant.,"This is arguably the best sushi in Easton (maybe even the shore)! I've tried all the others and I keep coming back. The staff is friendly and always asks about my family when I come in alone. The wait for food is never long, even if the place is full. You can dine in at lunch and get back to work quick. The menu items consistently taste amazing and are prepared the same way everytime... there are no surprises, if you order an Olympic roll it's going to be amazing Every Single Time, and that surely can not be said for the other places in town. Some of my favorites are ""Amazing Tuna"" ""Jingle Bell"" ""Olympic"" ""Incredible"" and ""spicey crab"" but all of them are good. If you go between 12 and 4 the special is ""get 1 special roll and get a second at half off"". Oh, and their unsweetened tea is the best in town, I know that's a small thing but it matters to me since I've given up soda.

If you're looking for a great place to have Sushi in Easton look no farther than usushi!"

Three 65 inch tvs in each space kept everyone entertained during our downtime. The room was clean, nice and spacious. The hotel itself was very clean and nice in all areas. The pool is nicer than average hotel pools featuring a shallow wading pool for small children and main pool with basketball hoop and a larger slide for older kids.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMDg3VFdBEAE,A Google Maps review about a exhibit.,"NOT WORTH THE COST!!!
Save your money, and use the $25 for something that is more than 10 mins long. Also for $75 we could have   had hours worth of fun some where else in the city rather than 10 mins.

Is it a fun experience for children ages 3 to 12, yes! If money is NOT a worry for you then go and enjoy yourself. Our child had a great time for the 15 mins. However, $25 for adults and children is absolutely ridiculous. At BEST this is should cost $12 for adults $5 for children.

The only reason they can get away with charging such an absurd price is because it is in Faneuil Hall.

Our daughter had a great time. But for 10-15 mins of walking around for $25 is INSANE."

There is one small elevator serving all of Quincy Market and if it‚Äôs inop - you cannot access the Dino Safari since it‚Äôs located up a huge flight of stairs. They suggested we carry the stroller upstairs. Not possible due to weight of stroller & 19-month old ‚Äî but also not safe for child. The folks at Dino Safari said they‚Äôve ‚Äúbeen asking‚Äù them to fix the elevator for some time.
Just keep accessibility in mind if you have a wheelchair, stroller, or if climbing multiple stairs is difficult.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtck12SUJnEAE,A Google Maps review about a exhibit.,"While the venue space is limited, the dinosaur construction was high quality with decent historical information.   The upside to their reservation system is that you go through the exhibit without being crowded.  My family and I went during the last half hour of a Sunday. We couldn‚Äôt dillydally, but it was almost like having the place to yourself."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocjk2dklREAE,A Google Maps review about a exhibit.,Kids and adults can enjoy this place
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlck1EQjNnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a exhibit.,It‚Äôs amazing how each species is divided by continent and pointed out that the dinosaur in front of the triceratops is actually a centrosaurus.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHN2YzR0J3EAE,A Google Maps review about a exhibit.,Great experience! My 5 year old daughter had a blast. The highlight was the interactive experience of creating your own dinosaur at the end of the walk through. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Highly recommended....my daughter is already asking to go back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa2NqSDJRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a exhibit.,"Main takeaways: not worth the price, but the kids did have fun. The exhibit was small, very warm (no ac even in Summer), and the main thing is that the dinosaurs appear to be inflatable? And in very poor condition (missing teeth, hair and feathers missing in large patches, sections of the inflatable not working etc.) the lighting is also very low and odd. It seems designed to be scary and colorful maybe, instead of actually being able to see any detailing on the creatures. I paid $25 per person (including the kids) and you can see the exhibit in 15-20 minutes (reading all of the educational material). It just isn‚Äôt worth it.

The only reason this isn‚Äôt a 1 star or a complaint to the organization for a refund, is that the kids did have fun. The dinosaurs are touchable (probably why they are in such terrible condition). And there is an interactive coloring program at the end that is pretty good (but even that was glitchy.)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bk0tNnVRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a exhibit.,"It's a nice little fun place for the kids.  Wish it outdoors though, would've been a better experience. Nice animatronic and life size dinos.  My kids had fun."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNGJqQkhBEAE,A Google Maps review about a video arcade.,"I see you Fun 4 You... They have the classic arcade games and they have recently put in some new arcade games. All well maintained! Games gave lots of tickets (the kids loved that). Personal favorite is the Jurassic World Game. Prizes are not the best, but kids always have a blast when we swing in before the movies!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNod3ZQYU93EAE,A Google Maps review about a tropical fish store.,"Lots of options but detracting a couple stars because they sold me an endlicheri bichir as a delhezi.
Big difference in max sizes between the two.
Endlicheri is a lower jaw bichir, unlike all my other bichir, which is why I wanted the delhezi it was labeled as.. an upper jaw bichir."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdHBUYUl3EAE,A Google Maps review about a tropical fish store.,"Friendly, helpful people, who are clearly passionate about aquariums and ponds. The building itself has a wonderful Old Austin vibe."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRdW9uWmJREAE,A Google Maps review about a tropical fish store.,"Very nice selection with a few issues: Many of the tanks are mislabeled; the fish are a different species or don't have a label at all. The short woman with the bangs is very rushed and careless when handling fish. She seems to be annoyed with questions and customers overall. All of the other employees, however, are friendly and care about where/how your fish will be living.

Aisles are a bit narrow, and I doubt they're ADA compliant. Salt water tanks are on the second floor, which is only accessible via stairs. Pond area is nice. The parking can be tricky, but it's mostly shaded.

All in all Aqua-Dome is a decent local spot for fish and aquarium accessories."

I got 5 ember tetras that are all doing great!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRM1lhTmhRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a tropical fish store.,This is one of my most favorite places in Austin period. It‚Äôs beautiful and very well taken care of.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNnZEbU5nEAE,A Google Maps review about a tropical fish store.,"At best, I'm a novice at the aquarium hobby. I've been setting up an aquarium and navigating all the intricacies that comes with setting up a new aquarium. In doing so, a social media aquarium hobby group recommended the Austin Aqua Dome as a solid, local hub for hobbyists. During my visit, I was greeted and invited to ask any questions I might have.

The building calls back to the ""Keep Austin Weird"" idea in both supporting a local business *and* being a wonderfully unique shopping experience in offering an infinite collection of aquarium related materiel to purchase- from fresh water to salt/marine, from ponds, to desktop bowls and extravagant custom aquariums. My overall experience was akin to me being a kid going on a great field trip like a previous visitor mentioned in their review.

Though I am still waiting to introduce fish to my aquarium, I was able to have questions answered about different live plants suitable to my experience and want for the type of fish community I'll eventually be keeping. I was introduced to a myriad of different plant varieties and they had a wonderfully diverse set of options to choose from. I ended up purchasing 5 plants of two different kinds and a wonderful piece of prepared driftwood for my setup. I also bought a plant solution to introduce and maintain for my water that promotes growth. Finally, because I look to continue my business relationship with Austin Aqua Dome, I purchased a one year membership that will likely pay for itself as my odyssey into this passtime grows. High fives all around and I can't wait to go back again and, if my S.O. doesn't kill me, maybe start a 2nd aquarium in the near future!"

They truly have always cared about my aquatic pets and listen to me passionately talk about my snails. MELISSA was an angel!! A true gem and the best addition to this Austin staple. I can't give her my highest regards. She helped me find tank mates for my big black Moor named Ronnie. She truly cared and gave me the best tips and fun facts about the creatures I was adopting. She made the shopping experience so much fun. It made my week and I love my new aquatic pets!!! I can't reccomend aquadome enough. Their selection is beautiful and store set up is otherworldly.

From my experience, the weekends get pretty crowded with more buyers than staff. For a low stress perusal, I would suggest the weekdays."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCc3QtUUt3EAE,A Google Maps review about a tropical fish store.,"This place is awesome for anyone starting your first fishtank to aquarists! It is not your typical aquarium store. There is a wide variety of fish, coral, and equipment for anyone‚Äôs budget ranging $-$$$.  There is saltwater fish upstairs and freshwater fish downstairs. Would recommend going on a weekday instead of a weekend to avoid crowds.

I cannot speak enough about the staff! Most of the staff have been there for 15+ years and are enthusiasts themselves. They never rush you and are always there to help you. They also love sharing info and care tips. Hunter was very friendly and helpful; we got to understand more of his specialty: saltwater fishes!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRcDd1RGtRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a tropical fish store.,"Probably the coolest way to make/show off a bunch of aquariums! They've got just about anything you could need on a few nicely organized walls & a very knowledgeable, friendly staff to help you out! I went there to get some water-turtle (Red Eared Slider) safe plants for my 30gal tank & they had a TON of diff plant species to pick through <^¬∑^> They have a big area outside with mostly red-eared slider turtles in it..which i would guess might be from people who aren't able to keep their turtles once they start getting bigger :S (sadly a common occurrence with the adorable baby sliders since they're SO easy to find in TX & not everybody getting them is well informed on their care or needs to keep them healthy. )"

The Aquadome if you're south of downtown or Aquatech if you are north. The aquadome has hundreds of both salt and fresh water fish, coral, live rocks and sand, crustaceans, outdoor ponds and fish, and every type of supplies you would need. Prices are great and the staff is both knowledgable and friendly. Pro-tip... buy the loyalty card. Best 20 bucks you can spend if you are a fish hobbyist."

Picked up 9 frags and they're all healthy and lovely. Massive selection too with very competitive pricing. I'll be getting all my coral here from now on!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyb01qSUlBEAE,A Google Maps review about a inn.,"We were here the end of April.  The views from the back balcony are stunning over looking the river. But the views of the snow capped Sawtooth mountains as you come out the front door are jaw dropping and breath taking! The room was cozy,  bed comfy, loved the assortment of different firmness of pillows.  The kitchen was well stocked. My only suggestion is to get a room on the top floor,  we could hear our upstairs neighbors walking around until late and early in the morning."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTdzRYa1lBEAE,A Google Maps review about a inn.,"My Fianc√© and I had the most incredible time staying here! We went for New Years and weren't really sure what to expect, but ended up having our expectations blown out of the water. The staff is incredible hospitable and warm to everyone they meet. Their restaurant on the main floor is, in our opinion, a 5 star dining experience. We were blown away by the chefs choices, we ended up trying almost everything on the menu during our 4 night stay. We honestly could not pick a favorite. We LOVED staying here. The rooms are comfortable with large beds and beautiful sights. I don't think you could be disappointed if you stay here. Also, their hot tub is large and a wonderful addition to our stay."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZMElUUnFBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a inn.,"So,  we decided to wing it and drive to Stanley for an overnight adventure without making reservations at the more popular place to stay in Stanley.  We were pleasantly surprised with the price ,location, quality, friendliness, and scenic view  that we were able to obtain at the redfish riverside inn.  The office was closed when we arrived but called Dianna and she came over within five min.
The room came with two queen beds with what I believed to be 1000 thread count sheets.  Refrigerator, two stovetop burners, microwave and beautiful view of the Salmon river.  We saw a wolf, fox and herd of elk the next morning while having coffee on our deck.   This place was awesome and I can't say enough good thing about it. The pic shows elk upstream from the room."

I slept wonderfully listening to the rolling water of the salmon river every night! The river is literally right behind the back balcony or porch. We were upstairs and had an incredible view of the river, the mountains and even a couple of elk that came down to drink water from the river.
We reserved a room with two Queen beds and a room with a king. Both rooms were great, but the king room was extra special for my wife and I. We loved it. I would have even enjoyed sleeping on the balcony! Hahahahahaha!
When I first called to ask a few questions regarding making reservations there, the wonderful lady that helped me went above and beyond what I was expecting. I booked a room immediately. Later on that day, I booked a second room. The pricing was way better than I expected. The service was way better than I expected. The rooms were way better than I expected.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaWVHRjh3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,It was fun for my 4 year daughter. However I was a little disappointed alot of the exhibits were repetitive with the same fish different tanks. Thwy used to have a lot of different species of fish and now they are gone (octopus being 1 of them).
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeFlTc0tnEAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,Sea Life really surprised me! My kids (7 and 3) had so much fun! So did I. I did not expect a touch tank and that was very cool. The aquariums were extremely clean and all the sea animals looked healthy. It was incredible to be so close to sharks and stingrays.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzaUphWUVBEAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,It was perfect for my 2 year olds birthday present but we went on a Saturday so her dad could be present and it was so over crowded it was hard for her to enjoy it as much as she would have had it been less crowded. They had a tide pool for the kids to touch sea creatures which was cool. My cousin brought her 2 year old on a Tuesday around noon and barely anyone there and she said I'd probably find it much more enjoyable with baby girl had we gone then so well have to do it like that next time because there's sO much to see you could easily enjoy going a second time as well as your kiddo if they love animals like mine does. It was awesome 5 stars aside from over crowding maybe they could have more control over the times and let less people in at a time and have legit ticket times or stone more organization in that way to make it easier first you to see everything.üòÉ(bad pics sorry was taking videos and it won't let me post videos üòî)

Highly recommended."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBMm9XQ0d3EAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"A nice little aquarium.  We enjoyed the hour we spent there.  They have a good selection of fresh and salt water fish in a fairly small area.  Their tanks are not as big as at Shedd or some of the other big aquariums but for the shopping mall its not bad.  I agree that for a family of four the price feels high but keep in mind that it costs significantly less than Shedd or the Georgia Aquarium, both of which are hundreds of miles away.   The kids in our group had a nice time.  In my view of the world, this is a much better use of time and money than the movie theater next door."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrbjlMX3FRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,It's OK considering there are no real aquariums in the area. Only worth it with $5 upgrades from Legoland.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURFcHRHVTh3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"Not sure why people complain about this place. We were inside for a little over an hour. We had enough time to see everything and it wasn't too crowded. The staff are extremely friendly and good with kids and happy to answer any questions.

We got a Groupon and it was about $26 for an adult and 1 kid, total. They also have various coupons online and you can combine prices with Legoland for a larger discount. We went the cheap route and just went to Sea Life.

We bought the $5 Mission Pack and my nephew (7 yo) was super excited to find all of the stamps and get his little badge of completion. They even have a little play area (think McDonald's play area size) at the end of the tour, in addition to various simple games throughout the whole place.

Nephew's Review: ""Uh I like Sea Life. It's one of my favorite uhh fishing museums I've ever went to. Fart. Don't add that fart there. Don't add it."""

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlamV6MF9RRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"The walk through will take you about an hour, even less if you walk too quick so take your time.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBcTUyQVl3EAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"SEA LIFE Michigan Aquarium is a great place to go.  The entry fee is a little high but in line with other aquariums around the country.  If they brought it down a little I believe they would see even more traffic and serve a greater part of the community.

The exhibits are kept neat and clean on the outside.  There were just two tanks they seemed to be having problems with but it was obvious they were working on it.  The staff was welcoming and engaged.  We had a slight difficulty at exit getting our ‚Äòfree photo‚Äô when we were directed to go back into the line to get it.  That was worked out satisfactorily.

They have apparently been actively engaged in breeding and helping wounded wildlife but I did not see anything specific about that in the exhibits other than some numbers posted at entry.

They have a wide variety of sea life on display and they all appeared in good health.  Most of the displays had plastic plants in them.  It would be nice to see more natural environments for the creatures and to examine them.

The viewing tunnel was very crowded.  There was no docent there and several patrons took the opportunity to rest and enjoy the tunnel while a single line file of other patrons had to navigate through along with carriages and mall baggage they might have with them.

Overall this is an excellent location to visit.  The children enjoyed it.  I would recommend by passing the play area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLLXBLM1VnEAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,Super cool!!! We did feel rushed because there wasn't time to really stop and read signs as people were hurded thru. We will come again tho and just walk slow even if people get mad. Great learning environment for the kids and 90% of the stuff in the gift shop at the end happens to be recycled!!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1enMzMHd3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"I was skeptical when we arrived at the mall, but what a pleasant surprise finding this aquarium. You must buy your tickets online, they were no line coming in. Love how all the rooms are educational and tell you on the iPad located on the wall about all the fish you see in the tanks. There was an opportunity for the kids to touch starfish and anemones. We were impressed with the see-through tunnel toward the end with sharks, turtles, colorful fishes, and stingrays.  The kids had a blast, we will be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlZ2JqaGhRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,I really liked this place. I visited with my husband & he enjoyed it as well. The walk through tunnel was amazing!

Good day & time to visit,  had to buy tickets online in advance also had to pick a time to enter Aquarium we were a group of 6 adults.  Terrific place to visit located inside Great Lakes Crossing, medium size aquarium, tank displays were Fantastic  with so many different species of aquatic life.  The touching pool was Great w/a variety of species to touch.  Wonderful how exhibits are spaced out and totally wheelchair accessible.  The entire Aquarium is so kid friendly, will definitely be going back w/the G'children.  We spent about 45 mins inside the venue then went and had a late lunch in the food court."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dk1xZXRRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"Honestly it was pretty difficult to social distance and it's definitely not a big aquarium by any means but it felt very clean and inviting, and the young man who was in charge of the open touching tank was so kind and patient with everyone on a busy Saturday it seemed unreal. Over all all 9 of us had fun especially the teenagers and one year old. I'd recommend going on a weekday instead of on the weekends tho."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVcl92OG13RRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"As this being my first time visiting this Aquarium, I was completely mindblown by the Sea Life on exhibit, & aside from myself my family were highly impressed with such beautiful creatures and designs of the tanks (in & out), I was back home in Michigan in the middle of the week and they had it packed and just as exciting as a weekend party, the gift shop was amazing and the playground made the children feel even more excitement then visiting McDonald's"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwaDlfa3B3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"This aquarium is a wonderful experience for parents of children under 10. The price is too steep but being able to walk through it multiple times in the day is great. Having to walk through the gift shop to exit is a little frustrating because it feels as though you are being forced to buy something but the prices are relatively reasonable. The interactive portions are really neat. If you are in the area, this is a great stop. You could go through the whole thing in 20 minutes or a few hours depending on how much you focus on exploring."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwbGZ6MGN3EAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,WONDERFUL place for ALL ages! We come here once a year for a birthday. Well worth the 3 hour trip. Love the touch pool where you can touch sea creatures.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRenYzZ2p3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"This aquarium is actually pretty awesome! I didn't think it'd be as nice as it is.

There is a Legoland discovery attached if you'd like, you just need to have a child between 3-10, adults only cannot enter."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0M2E2YzRnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"My family and I enjoyed the aquarium. There are a lot of great sea life to enjoy and some games to play. Older children would probably not enjoy this as much as the younger ones. Still a great experience and place to educate on all things water life.
As a person who has enjoyed many aquariums throughout the states, this one is very small when doing price comparison. If you use the coupons and discounts available (AAA, buy legoland get aquarium, or child free coupons) it is worth it. However the price without such is not worth it.
Example: (walk up pricing)
TN adults are $35 & child (3-12) $22
MI adults are $24 & child (3-12) $19
TN -We spent 4 hours exploring 2 HUGE buildings Sea & Fresh water life(could have explored longer too). Played several free games. Touched turtles.
MI- 1 hour exploring played 2 free games, and touched turtles.
Is it worth visiting? Yes
Is it fun? Yes
Just plan ahead and get those discounts. Do not think it is like other big ones. It will not take long to get through so add in that legoland funüòÅ"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNEpPVXhRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"Decent for an aquarium that's located inside of a mall. It was quite magnificent nonetheless. Staff members were friendly, the layout is great for the space they have.
This aquarium has all of the basic creatures and exhibits that one might find in an aquarium. When the walkthrough finished, I was surprised by how quickly one can meander through for $23 - $26 dollars a person."

We got half priced tickets through an AZA Reciprocal Zoo membership. It took us about 1 hour and 45 minutes to work our way through the aquarium. It is located in a shopping center. I read many reviews saying it was too small but I found it to be perfectly sized for a family with small children."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxbDkybnRRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"First time we have gone. Really pretty neat. But the look outside thought it would be a bit bigger, but once you get in there not too bad. The hands on exhibit was super neat. The photos below are from that.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNjR1ZTZBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,Always have a decent time here. The kids really enjoy it and the information is fun to learn and interact with. The bathrooms however are absolutely disgusting so I can only assume the play area isn't sanitized either.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhN2N6SjJBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"Aquarium was cool, had a couple activity centers for kids to design a fish for a digital aquarium, a video game to get the sea turtles to the ocean and a wind tunnel where you could experience hurricane force winds.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhdnRpZ0xBEAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,Took my eight year old son and he loved everything! We had a great time. Worth the money.

Of course, when I went there at noon on a Saturday, there was no line. Still, nice discount. I enjoyed the experience. Nice stingray talk. We paid $3 for tickets to see the backstage area and to hear about how they feed and take care of the aquatic creatures. It added to our understanding and appreciation of SEA LIFE, so I recommend it. It wasn‚Äôt a big area, so it only took 20 minutes. You can add on LEGO land tickets online but only if you are taking kids 10 (or maybe 11?) and below."

It was later on a Saturday night and after we had placed our orders we were pleasantly surprised when our server not only brought some bread, but a nice bruschetta appetizer, as well, and he explained it was on the house since they were low on bread.  I went with the lasagna, as I also do, on my first visit to an Italian restaurant and it did not disappoint.  We had also ordered a beef carpaccio appetizer for the table that was quite excellent.  We capped off the meal with an exquisite rendition of tiramisu, that proved to be a delicious finale to our dining experience.  I highly recommend this restaurant and am definitely looking forward to my next visit!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNndWV5aXN3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a italian restaurant.,"Cute restaurant! We got our own little corner behind curtain, it was quite perfect for a group of loud kids and adults.

Meatballs and the sauces were very good!!! The other entrees portions are all too big. Seafood risotto was not bad, I would prefer the seafood not cooked so much that they were a bit chewy.

We all laughed over the one giant piece of ravioli, that was not expected. It smelled really good and was told that it tasted very good too.

They have a large menu of wine by glass and by bottle. Cocktail menu was pretty standard.

I would prefer here than any other chain restaurant, but there are also much better Italian out there."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzcC1fUkRnEAE,A Google Maps review about a italian restaurant.,"Came here originally on my birthday last year . The food is just amazing. The chef / owner is from Italy and knows how to cook. The homemade pastas were amazing , the staff knew what kind of wine my wife needed , as their wine menu was very overwhelming. Huge wine menu lol .

My wife wanted come back on Valentine‚Äôs Day weekend on a Saturday , and it was such a lovey experience ..... we started with the fried calamari. It was crunchy and tender. Got a nice $30 of Cabernet and it was smooth. I don‚Äôt really drink wine but I was able to drink a whole bottle with wifey . Next we got a shrimp / crab dish and 4 cheese ravioli. Outstanding entrees. Didn‚Äôt look like much but we were very stuffed . Last was our lime something cake ....

We did come at 8pm so the crowd died down so our service was pretty spot on .

Love love love this place !

***updates*** 12/21/2020

Just came here on a Monday for my bday and it was perfect ! When we got there at 6pm there was only us and another table. We practically had the restaurant for a good 30 minutes to ourselves . Usually this place is packed but probably due to covid it has slowed down. They closed their larger dining area. We had a bottle of wine , few appetizers , and two main courses ! Our food was awesome ! And service was great ! Wish it was busier so the restaurant stays in business.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1X3RTVFZnEAE,A Google Maps review about a italian restaurant.,"This was our anniversary and we wanted to celebrate with fine tasting Italian food. This was it! Outside on their patio, sipping a tasty, tart cocktail and a nice Barbera red. We love caprese and adding basil pesto is a keeper. The Tuscan Nido was perfect-handmade and hands down the largest ravioli-the added surprise of an egg yolk hidden inside was genius! The Filetto Di Maiale(pork tenderloin) was perfectly cooked and the flavor was mouth watering, even as I ate it! We wrapped it up with their lemon cake. Oh, man, so light and lemony. We took smaller and smaller bites so it would last longer. Give them a go, we‚Äôll certainly be back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVdnJ1Q1pnEAE,A Google Maps review about a italian restaurant.,"Wonderful food, beautiful garden setting,  knowledgeable staff.   Chef Nicola and wife Esperanza greet you.

Can't reccomend it enough."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvb3ZxTlJBEAE,A Google Maps review about a italian restaurant.,"Great service, atmosphere, cocktails, wine list. I have only visited once and have only tried their rissotto, which was better than any I've had here in Columbus although no where near as good as what I've had back in Tuscany. Overall, recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvN3VXNUlnEAE,A Google Maps review about a italian restaurant.,"Excellent service, friendly staff, huge wine list and tasty food. We had a great bottle of Chianti. Then we split the calamari and caprese. The calamari was perfectly cooked, not chewy at all. I saw the guy in the kitchen breading it. The caprese was honestly one of the best I've had. Being winter, the tomato wasn't the best but the mozzarella was perfect. It was topped with a delicious pesto. And the plate was drizzled with the thickest balsamic glaze I've ever had. It was almost like caramel. The balsamic glaze was extremely flavorful. For our main courses, we had the Tuscan Nido and the wild mushroom Tagliatelle. The Tuscan Nido was basically a giant ravioli. The filling had great flavor. I loved the pops of whole peppercorn and the fried sage leaves. The pasta was clearly homemade and perfect. The wild mushroom Tagliatelle was even better. The mushroom flavor was amazing and the smell was just divine. Normally, I would have liked to see the addition of truffle to a dish like this but honestly, I think it was near perfect without. The mushrooms just had such good flavor. To top off our meal, the lady who seated us came around to see how our meal was. Based on our conversation, I assume she was the owner. She was incredibly sweet. We will be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNVpMRzhnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a italian restaurant.,"I WAS ROBBED!  The fact that this place is so highly rated is further evidence that Columbus completely lax any decent Italian restaurant.

It was as though some artificial intelligence program was assigned the task to create Italian food.

I would have been more satisfied if I ate a pop tart and gave the rest of my money away.   I could go into detail but it would discriminate some of the many bad aspects of this place

BOO. YUCK. BLAH."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhLUxuWmpnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a buffet restaurant.,"Today my family and I arrived at Golden Corral in Sterling Heights Michigan and were extremely disgusted with what we saw.

After paying (over $60) we finally found a table that was clean. When we went to the bar, we saw nothing but food thrown all over the floor, the bar was disgustingly dirty, and completely empty. Servers and the manager were just walking through the food all over the floor, never cleaning anything at all. It was so bad, I decided to take photos as well for you.

After sitting down, it took us 15 minutes to get silverware, and over 25 min to get drinks. Our server never cleared the plates from our table when needed either.

As for at the bar; the woman doing the steaks was more interested in flirting and trying to get a date with a customer than actually helping customers, cleaning anything, or even putting steaks on the grill. The salad bar was basically full of rotting fruit and slimy lettuce.

At the desert bar, there was chicken on the floor, food everywhere. My biggest concern was the fact that there were peanuts all over the bar, mixed into other toppings, on the cookies, on the brownies, etc. As someone with an extreme nut allergy, this type of cross contamination is deadly, let alone disgusting.

For $60 my family and I ate one plate of food that was cold by the time we got our silverware because the bar was empty and never refilled. I understand that places may be short staffed but that is not an excuse for any of this. If the health department would have walked in, the place would have been closed immediately‚Ä¶.and honestly should have. When the manager, the staff, the servers, and guests are having to walk through food on the floor and nothing is being cleaned or refilled, that‚Äôs awful. We have been here several times and this is the most disgusting restaurant I have ever seen.

The photos shown below are just some of the photos I took. The entire restaurant was like this."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbElQa0VREAE,A Google Maps review about a buffet restaurant.,"If you spend a dollar at this place, you're drunk, high, or both. Absolutely disgusting restaurant in every way imaginable. Odd aroma throughout the entire restaurant... all the food tastes like said aroma. If you don't get sick from the food, you may just die by getting stabbed by the knives that are stuck in the ceiling tiles. Heath department needs to shut this place down like yesterday! 4.0 rating at the time of this review has got to be a joke. Save yourself, your loved ones, and your pocket book. Gotta run... Emergency bathroom break!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvdXBiVV9BRRAB,A Google Maps review about a buffet restaurant.,"Decent food for the price. I mean, where else can you go for tamales, steak cooked to order, a fondue fountain, and cotton candy in one restaurant? Go on a weeknight and avoid the weekend at all costs. Even a snowstorm couldn't keep this place from getting PACKED! When it gets like that, there's just not enough staff to compensate. Outside of the weekends it's a good place to go."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrejZhUmRBEAE,A Google Maps review about a buffet restaurant.,"Disappointing experience at the Golden Corral on Hall Road today...not because of the food but management. You were left standing once you paid to eat as management took up shop on various tables with paperwork for employees to sign. On top of that, tables were not being cleared because management had employees doing paperwork!!! Never had this experience at the Port Huron location and will be taking our loyal business there from now on."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpMFBYMjJnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a buffet restaurant.,"This used to be a good place, Warden Whitmer ruins another place in Michigan. You have to stand in line to get food, three servers and depending on your server, you might as well eat at a soup kitchen. You'll certainly get more. The buffet looks ransacked, and NOT WORTH 34.00 for two people. My father ordered chocolate milk (pictured below) and i   guess them adding a drop of chocolate mix to it qualifies. This experience SUCKED!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbXVqR1hREAE,A Google Maps review about a buffet restaurant.,"Rarely do I give a bad review ....but....
Disgusting.  If only zero stars were available.  Place needs a full cleaning. Maybe rip out disgusting carpet and try vinyl flooring... Plastic cutlery? Maybe since covid?   But had to ask for it vs getting at payment and entering.
Many tables were not wiped down without asking after awaiting a significant time. Unused tables stacked with piles of dishes. This st 4pm so not a full dinner rush.   I'd hate to see it during rush time.

The buffet had many empty pans due to non attention.

I've been  to several Golden Corral in many other major city centres. And this so far by far has been the worst!
Find another location or establishment for a better dining experience

Picture added is only 1 set of tables ...though many tables were the same throughout the restaurant"

The appearance and taste of the food has declined over the years but yesterday was the bottom. Breakfast foods were burnt the pancakes and hashbrows. The lunch items seemed to be better but onenof my guest became ill  upon eating the soup that they warm in the tray tables during breakfast.  Food was visibly dry and looked as if it was from yesterday.  The manager Mitch was rude and made bad claims upon my family when one person requested a refund upon eating the soup or salad that they became sick with.  However the  other manager reviewed  the cameras and provided her with refund. Our waitress Sunday was very attentive and friendly.

Now a days days the food quality has dropped tremendously. The options of which they serve you is bare minimal or cold. Went to get meat on friday there is no special meats any longer. The ham and ribs were cold. Steak used be a better quality as well. Salad bar doesn't include bacon anymore? No mk or chocolate fountain. Only 2 pie selections. As I said the quality used to be better. All of these are things noticed by my child it's her favorite restaurant. My waitress was awesome ty Brittany. Over all the food was def not fresh all but the steak the options were slim and not very tasty. I tried a little of everything even the bourbon street chicken used to be better. I understand that sometimes business is slow but this was dinner rush 6 pm to 7pm .  Prolly won't bring my child back.  The staff in kitchen was helpful and pulled cold food once notified

The balls glow in the dark and can be ‚Äúreactivated‚Äù every 3 golf courses. The Black lights brighten everything up and I would recommend wearing clothes with colors that will glow.

Glow putt did get busy towards the end of our time there but we never felt in the way of that we were holding anyone up.

I‚Äôd recommend for all ages (1-99+) and for all types of activities (dates, birthdays)

10/10 would recommend taking a selfies or group photos on the 17th hole tunnel."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDak0tTlNREAE,A Google Maps review about a miniature golf course.,"This was a fantastic adventure. I would recommend going as a group of 2 or more. As this would be a very bland one person experience. The other people make it a blast.

Its relatively cheap, only about 10$ a person, for an hour or longer depending on the size of your group.

If I had to describe my least favorite experience, it would be the lack of variety of some hole layouts. Few are rather creative, and have some cool glow in the dark features. Most are fairly straight forward and require very little creativity to sink the putt. I would have liked to have seen holes that allowed two or three different ways to complete them. Even this was not enough to deter me from having a great time at low cost.

They do offer different types of discounts and party plans. This was an excellent way to have fun out of the sun. The staff was friendly and courteous.

Also they have really respected the social distancing brought on by COVID19. Each putter and ball is wiped and sanitized before each new user. They require masks which can be fun if you get one that looks cool in the black light."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdllmZnNnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a miniature golf course.,"Clean and cool.  Cool decor, lighting and course.  Service was great too.  Has Air Hockey, but maybe a few arcade games added?  All in all, great family outing!  Suprised by low price as well."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNk4tMWlRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a miniature golf course.,"A good place to escape the AZ heat for 45 minutes to hour. There are 18 hours total.

Girls behind the counter were lovely"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwb1Bfc0F3EAE,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"Would highly recommend this great little Campground. The property was clean, very well kept, and had everything you could need. Play Set for kids, cozy tent & RV sites, coin operated showers, laundry, dishwashing station and even a place for fishermen to clean their catch. Convenient store with the basics as well as some handmade goods and local foods. The quaint little grill in the back makes a mean burger and has tons of food options. I enjoyed the seafood basket which was plentiful (shrimp, clam, scallops & fries).
Everyone we came into contact with was friendly and helpful. The only downside I might mention is that there is only of toilet and one shower for the whole park. We came in the off season, so this was no big deal. Not sure what it would be like in the busy season.
Overall a great place and we loved our stay! Will be returning for sure! Location is key and this place is perfectly situated between, Rialto Beach, La Push, Forks, & the Hoh. Didn‚Äôt hurt that they fully embrace the Twilight mania that has over taken this area either. I was here for the National Park, but am also a Twilight fan, so I really enjoyed all the little Twilight touches they had. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

The Pacific is like a fully appointed house! You have laundry, a dishwasher, a huge fridge, oven and stove...the works. It doesn't seem small! When we came in everything was spotless. Very, very clean.

The Resort is super welcoming, they have everything you'd need on site. Staff was friendly. We loved the Salmon Candy. Definitely 5 stars."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdWNEUFF3EAE,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"This is a private, small area for camping. Pros: safe, good location to be find but no necessary to stay, the camp site is to close to the highway. The restroom is a regular one which is great for a camp site, there is only one of this type but they have the other types, green pot? In the camp as well. The wood is a little to expensive at their store comparable with other stores in the area. They have an emergency line and they will help if, even if is a little late and that is always good üëç"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNrcDVEOWZREAE,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"This review is really mostly about the showers. Haha. Stopped in the store here today during an epic journey through the Olympic peninsula. I was searching for places to shower and came across a trip advisor review from 8 years ago that said there were showers available for 75 cents.  After hiking around in the sea breeze and camping out, I really wanted a shower, so we decided to stop in and ask if they were available and luckily were pointed in the right direction. There is a single stall shower in a small room, it is self serve, you just need quarters. 4 minute showers available for $2.00, 5 for $2.50 6 for 3.00 and 7 for $3.50. The water got hot, the pressure was average. The ladies in the office/store were friendly, shower was good, the camp itself looked clean, however, we had camped elsewhere."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVMUtTMW13RRAB,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"This was our second time staying here. They have upgraded some things.

Very cozy. Not many camp spots, but that's cool.
They have cabins and homes for rent.
One stall bathrooms, one stall showers, laundry facility, convenient store, gas pumps and restaurant!

All very convenient from the camp sites.

We ate burgers at the restaurant and they were great! We had a Quil Burger.
Prices aren't bad at all.

We would definitely stay here again!

I'm a vegetarian and had a few options which was nice. I had a salad and my husband and kids had burgers. There was hardly any crumbs left. The onion rings were AMAZING. Beer battered and fried to perfection. There is four of us and we each got a meal with sides and everyone got a dessert for $50 bucks the prices were very fair. The workers were all so nice and friendly. We will be coming back for sure!!!!!!

If visiting for Twilight they also have a Treaty Line sign across the street and a few different tourist items to check out!!!! Stop on your way to La Push and grab some burgers to eat at the beach!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpNWNudFBREAE,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"This is a good place to rent a cabin or camp with an RV but is terrible for tent camping. The showers they advertise are pay showers, it uses quarters with no place to set your clean clothes except the floor nor anywhere to sit to dress. The tent sites are very close to a busy road which you can hear road noise all night long. If you bring a pet they charge you $5 extra per night even if tent camping. There is also no water spigot for tent campers, only RV. The place is beautiful but that's all it has going for it."

It came stocked with pots and pans and other things you'd likely need, including a gas stove.

The owners operate a convenience store and restaurant. They're lovely people, friendly, and the food was good (not fancy, if that's your thing, but it was tasty).

Very conveniently located and they even had a gas station. Certainly worth staying here if you want to see Rialto Beach and soak up some nature."

The only thing keeping me from giving a two star or worse rating was the fantastic customer service: front desk, housekeeping, and the breakfast attendant. Otherwise this Hilton-brand Hampton Inn and Suites is not worth the higher price point than many of the other options in Aberdeen and is way overdue for a refresh (maybe we can blame Covid-19). The colors and finishes in the lobby, halls and rooms are dinged, scuffed and just plain ugly. The king-sized bed in our non-suite room was caving in and needing replacement. When booking, be aware not all the rooms are like the pictures on the site, some are very plain with no kitchenette, just an awkward mini fridge and microwave by the desk in the room. No real dresser if you like to unpack just a small hutch with sticking drawers that the TV sits on. Pull out style love seat sofa seemed like a great option for the kids, but the window was very drafty and our son about froze the first night. The blankets were very thin waffle weave style. We asked for a second for the next night and he put on extra clothes and was okay. Not comfortable enough for an adult, he slept on it backwards, because even he could feel the metal. The bathroom was a good size which was nice for a family traveling with younger kids, but the bathroom fixtures were loose and the shower almost didn't work. The toilet took several flushes. The pillows in our room weren't the usual mixture of firm and soft (feather and polyfill as it turned out for here), but housekeeping brought us new ones when we inquired at the front desk during breakfast. The breakfast was quite good. Many choices, including an oatmeal area with fixings, plus other hot options, waffles, fresh fruit, yogurt, biscuits and gravy one morning and the next eggs and sausage patties. Coffee options were hot. Pool and hot tub area was small, but we had fun anyways. Pool towels were restocked regularly. Elevator floor became sticky one evening, but as we were in and out, right away they had it mopped I noticed. Again, great customer service that way. We also did laundry which was weirdly on the second floor off in the corner, kinda creepy, but washing and each dry cycle was just a dollar in quarters. Front desk had change."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURreTlDOWhRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"MOLD AND TERRIBLE HOUSEKEEPING!!! Front desk has great customer service. Kayla was very attentive and has great customer service. I stayed ten nights and housekeeping would show up every other day. I had to do my own bed, and take out my trash on the days that no one would show up. On the days that they showed up it was around 4 PM and in a bad mood. I talked to a manager by the name of Kyle three times and he did nothing about it. My shower was never cleaned even though I mentioned to the housekeeping lady that I had mold in the shower. I stay at Hampton Inn‚Äôs all the time and this is definitely the worst house keeping in the country. They should win a Golden Globe Broom for the worst housekeeping service."

With the youth baseball activities in the area, it will get a lot of use, and really was needed to help with housing the families that come to the area for baseball events.  The location is great.  The parking is ample.  There are several food options in the immediate area.  The hotel is right off of Rt 95, with easy access."

The stocked kitchen with cooking utensils and pots & pans. The safe in the closet. The quietness and the food offerings at the counter. And the value for the money can't be beat.
I could not stay at another hotel  in the vicinity, after staying here. My hat's off to the management and owners for such a well designed and planned offer. I highly recommend your stay at this great hotel. You won't regret it!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvNVpIRTlnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"This place is epic.  When you first step into the park you're welcomed Disney-style by cast members hoping to share their story and complain about the mystery that has ""befallen the land"".  As you move from area to area interacting with characters (usually about 30-40+ each night) you find out more about this mystery.  Eventually, you realize that everything might not be as it seems and there are actually multiple mysteries and many different storylines to enjoy.  There are multiple levels of story that can be enjoyed by the first-timer, the introvert, extrovert, or the seasoned park-goer.  Come to socialize, to observe, enjoy the pretty lights and music, or to practice archery and axe throwing.  This place is truly loved by my 10-year-old boy, my teenage girls, and their grandparents.  My wife and I have taken some date nights here and didn't even tell the kids we went (or we'd be in trouble).  I am not into D&D and I hate dressing up for Halloween (sad, but true).  I'm a shorts and T-shirt kind of guy.  I still enjoy coming here again and again and playing along with the story and meeting new characters. Many people do dress up so if you're into that, you won't feel out of place.  While we don't dress up we still feel like we belong. Think of this as a ""live theater"" performance where you step onto the stage and the acting takes place close around you.   In the past, we've had season passes for Disneyland and have spent time in Disney World.  We also have had season passes for our local theater and love to attend.  I have to admit, the acting here is superb and a 10 out of 10!  I have been in situations where the tension could be ""cut with a knife"" and other situations where I've cried with the characters.  If you plan a trip, I'd recommend attending more than one evening.  You won't regret it.  The entrance fee is very reasonable (less per hour than a movie ticket) and the food there is well-priced and amazing (changes each season).  Make sure you arrive 15 minutes before they open and plan to stay until closing time.  Wear comfortable shoes. You don't have to walk a ton if you don't want to and I've seen people in wheelchairs and electric scooters....  but if you do enjoy walking and you get into the story, expect to get your steps in for the day!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdE9QSmlnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"This is a very unique place. It has a lot of potential. I can see it growing to be really popular. I write my experience with the hopes that improvements can be made to really enhance the place.

The park vibe:
Very cool idea. It did feel like we were in a whole different world. Sadly I could still see some things under construction which I wish was covered up like Disney does it. But I also understand the new business budget can‚Äôt afford that much. So not a big deal. I loved the characters walking around and being interactive. They were a lot of fun. At night the lightning is eery and fun. It would be kinda scary for young kids though. And it would be easy to loose a child in that lighting.

The costumes:
Very high quality costumes the employees wear. But also, many guests of the park wear costumes too. Which is fun but kinda difficult to tell who is an employee and who isn‚Äôt. I wished the employees had glowing name tags so I could know who to ask for directions and stuff from. It would be awkward to ask another guest for help.

The food:
I LOVED the sandwhich I ordered. Very yummy! The monte Cristo at the dessert shop was very oily though and I wished it had been cooked in an air fryer instead. I also wish the menu had pictures. It‚Äôs a lot easier for me to order things that I can see.

The magic show:
The beginning was really boring. Your typical magic tricks that you see. Was not a fan of the ‚Äúword‚Äù trick because there was no magic to it. He never even said what the word was. Maybe that was a distraction for his next trick but I didn‚Äôt like it. The last trick was awesome! One of my all time favorite tricks to watch. Very impressed with that. Giving his act more of a WOW the entire time would really make this place have more credibility. Go all out!

The train:
We loved the train. Super fun to see the whole town and go around the train. Fun for kids and fun for us. Just a short little ride.

The map:
I like the graphics of the map. That is user friendly. But the magician tent and stuff isn‚Äôt on it. And all the locations seem to be in the mythical words and make it not user friendly at all. I had no idea what there was to do and where it was. Many people around me were confused too. I wish we were given a map when we entered and I wish there were big maps around the park. I just need it to say the different places and what there is to do and explore at each one.

Getting Lost:
Aside from what I already talked about with the map, I wished each location had a solid sign of what it was right on the building or tent. I wasn‚Äôt sure what buildings we could and couldn‚Äôt go in. I need more than a chalkboard in front of the magician tent that says...
‚Äúmagic show‚Äù and then a sign at eye level with the times of the shows. I arrived at 6:00 and the sign said magic show every half hour. But they didn‚Äôt open till 7:00 so at 6:30 I was confused why nobody was there.

Haunted House:
Sadly I had to work and leave early so we were not able to experience the highlight of the park. Next time I‚Äôll give you some info on that.

Website:
The website for sure needs help. It needs to be more simple in layout and show what‚Äôs in the packages and what there is to do better. I needed everything disclosed. I kept reading about some sort of circus and when I asked some of the employees about it they said they were the circus.. I expected a circus show with animals and tricks. Not just characters walking around. Maybe it was a misunderstanding on my end but yeah really confusing. There is also a bird show that looks pretty cool from online but I wasn‚Äôt able to go to that either because I had to leave early for an important work zoom call.

I wish there was a restroom on the north side of the park too.

I also think it would be AWESOME to have a costume shop! Also little kiosks around selling hot coacoa, hand warmers, and fun merch.

Don‚Äôt let the 2 starts fool you. This place has the potential to be incredible. Just a few tweaks will make a big difference.

Wouldn‚Äôt recommend this for kids under age 8."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvaGRMdUNREAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Amazing experience! This place was totally awesome. My kids loved it, but I also look forward to coming without the kids to get deeper into all of the quests."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJajk3Z1p3EAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"The park is built with a lot of attention to detail. It is still new and there's a lot of building going on but it is still fun. The most fun was from interacting with the characters and Village People. They all have stories or ask you to do things. You can tease them play games with them, get your fortune told, and many more things. We ran errands for the queen was paid in silver, donated the silver to a good cause, play tricks on the characters and 8 delicious treats. We found it to be worth the money and the time"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNDQtQ2x3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"I was underwhelmed by my first visit, but I plan on giving them another shot.
I went oct 9th 2020.
The good:
The battle arena was lots of fun. It's the best thing there.
Archery was really cool. I wish the range was bigger so more people could shoot.  The wait to try archery is long. Like 30-45 minutes long.
My wife loved the hats and stuffed dragons.
Axe throwing looked neat but only two people could try at a time so the line was even longer than the line for archery.
We entered a large circus tent and saw a really fun show. Fire eaters, magic tricks, and gymnastics were all great to see.
There was a dragon skeleton.
The bad:
Long waits for most activities.
Some buildings were under construction and landscaping was a mess in some areas.
Questing for the various guilds could use a lot of improvement. Most of the entry level quests just don't sound fun. They will tell you some vague thing like ""learn a secret"", ""gain someone's trust"", or ""learn three people's names"". I wish the tasks were more fun. Why not find a monster? Fight somebody? Climb something? None of the quests sounded fun except for archery, and after I waited a long time in line to do that they closed down the range for a tournament right before it was my turn to go. Super disappointing.
Half the park was taken up by their haunted maze. It looked fun, but it was sold out for the night.
I'll probably go again in the winter or summer and just spend the whole day in the arena."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNveGR2MTl3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"It has great potential but it's just not there yet. It was still under construction in several places and it took away from the overall experience. I.E. construction equipment, metal fences, areas unaccessible.
The actors are great and stay in character very well. The kids enjoyed it but at the stage it is in now I think the price point is too high."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eWJ5SWVBEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Enjoyed the entire experience. Beautifully themed. Characters ready for the guests and quests. Highly recommend for families, couples, or anyone who enjoys a different kind of experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBcTRLM3BBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Judging by the quality of construction and materials used to make the place look authentically from some fantasy world (is that an oxymoron?), this place is going to be stunning when they are finished.  But what really matters most are the many characters that roam the village and stay true to their being.  We will definitely be back to take it all in when they finish building it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMweEsyOHZRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,Evermore was so fun. We took our daughter for her birthday and it could not have been more perfect or magical for her. The characters were all so devoted and made the whole experience immersive and unforgettable. I cannot wait to come back!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnejdLZTF3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Evermore park is a great theme park based on performance and costumes. As well as a park with a unique, ominous, fantasy atmosphere. Though it was not quite complete when I attended (opening night celebration) as several buildings were fenced off or still under construction, it has immense promise. The main appeal to me wasn't the gorgeous hand chiseled decorations, imported 400 year old statues, live instrument music, fantasy taverns filled with druids and fawns, or the dark gothic feel. But rather the inadvertant way the park enables everyone to show up as themselves. Free of judgment, and equally included. Regardless of their appearence or uniqueness. It's a much needed feeling in today's world. And that's how the park will likely be, for evermore."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d3V6YmNBEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,What an amazing place!!! I had no idea that this place existed until today. We ate at Vanders keep and the. Decide to visit the park. I was not ready for the wonder inside. Make sure you interact with the characters in the park to go on the special quests.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhc3BiZl9nRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"I was highly impressed by this place. The actors were great, the activities were fun, and the environment was pretty believable. It feels like they've got a a ways to go till their park is fully built and their vision realized but for $15 a ticket with few activities costing extra, this place is a steal! I would expect to pay more than I did for a fire dance and aerial silk show alone but that was only one of the many things they offered. Come in costume and come ready to be a dork immersed in a fantasy world. I highly recommend this to anyone into costumes, fantasy, role-playing, and especially D&D."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJckpxWjZRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"OVERVIEW - 4.8
Came here as a work activity.  We were enticed by how elusive the place is on details, let alone online.  We actually ended up looking at Evermore's social media to get a better understanding.

LOCATION - 5
Ever more is located in Pleasant Grove not too far the freeway and other surrounding businesses such as Essential Oils.  I had to use a GPS to find the location and then parking was a little confusing (I parked in the back thinking it was the front.)

PRICE - 4
Pricing was a little steep for my liking, but it was worth the experience.  My daughter had just turned 6 and so I had to pay for her, whereas if she was 5 or under she would have been free....  If I had to name the prices, I would set $15 at the perfect price for adults.

PRODUCT/SERVICES - 5
This is where this place excels!  The attention to detail was remarkable!  I was impressed by the Evermore cast.  They played their roles rather well.  I enjoyed the various roles they had as well such as the Druids, which were both serious and kind, the executioner was rather intimidating, the fairies were enlightening, the dragon trainer was so kind to my daughter.  If you have a chance to meet her do it!  She was awesome with my daughter.  I was even convinced that dragons were real after talking to her.

POINTERS/PERKS - 5
The objective of Evermore other than walking around and enjoying the detail is to interact with the cast.  Talk to them, go on quests.  They will give you tiny missions if you ask what you can do for them.  Keep in mind as the night progresses (especially near Halloween), that details and new quests can change.  Another trick I learned is sometimes you can listen in on someone else completing a quest, and then you come by a few minutes with the same details...  I would also recommend that if you have a poor memory like me, you may want to have something to jot down details such as a small notebook or your phone.  That's another detail, you may want to have a phone in case you get separated from your party as it is very likely.

If you complete a certain amount of quests you can become honor positions.  Such as a co-worker and his girlfriend both became honorary knights.

EMPLOYEES - 5
This is where they excel!  They stay in character the whole time.  Their details to their lives is amazing.  I also love it when characters interact with one another.  I saw a fairy talk to a soldier like they were the best of friends."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3anJtbzFRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Fun immersive experience. We went with a group and it was a lot of fun to talk about and speculate about things together. It also allowed us to break up and gather info from various characters and then come together and share knowledge. All of the characters were wonderful and some were absolutely delightful to talk to. I also enjoyed trying out the archery and seeing all the elaborate decorations. The animals were also a lot of fun. We had a group of adults and a toddler and we all had a blast.

One tip: bring a fully charged phone. Some of the quests required you to take pictures. Also, they give you a booklet when you enter the park, but they ran out of pencils. So I used my phone to take notes (it was helpful for remembering character names and things we were looking for on our quests)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0X3NmdUpREAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"We LOVE Evermore! Our son refers to it as ""The Cool Place"". This is a one-of-a-kind attraction and we're lucky to have it so close.

We went to each of their previous seasons (Lore and Aurora) several times because there's so much to experience. Not only do you see characters here, but you interact with them, asking them questions and weaving your own way into the story as a participant. There's laughter, intrigue, puzzles, and LOADS of fun to be had.

We're just waiting for them to offer a Season Pass (wink, wink, nudge, nudge Evermore)."

It would be nice to have a place to have a sit down meal instead of finger food. Very impressed with the staff. They are all in character and very nice to talk to. Heaters and fire pits throughout the park is a nice touch as it was extremely cold. Can't wait for the park to expand as some buildings are still under construction. This is a great family park.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc0xqaEpBEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"My wife surprised me for my birthday in August and we loved it so much, we returned in September, for our anniversary but this time we dressed in medieval apparel and so thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoc2FYU1BREAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Valentine's Day dinner experience was like being stuck at point of the mountain during rush hour. You're just stuck in the miserable experience with everyone around you because they already took your money.

We made reservations and thought it would be a good experience since it was their 3rd day of the Valentine's Day dinner and also because they had a set menu, in theory making it more efficient.

This was not the case. First they had two entrances to the check in desk meaning people that had been waiting in an established line for 15-20 minutes, just to check in, were getting cut off by people just arriving. The staff was not able to check people in, take them to their seats and manage the flow of traffic because there were just two of them running the desk.

Once we were seated, we had no cups, no silverware and it took a solid 15 minutes to get our preordered soup and salad. It was another 10ish minutes after the soup and salad came that we finally got silverware and cups. Between finishing soups and salad and receiving our main course, it was nearly 1.5 hours and the grilled veggies were incredibly cold. The Mahi Mahi was ok, but the steak may as well have been jerky, no exaggeration, it was difficult to cut with a knife. We had seen the wait times and sent our desert ticket in with our main course so thankfully that came out promptly but others around us were waiting at least 15 minutes to get their desert.

All of this would have been more understandable if it had been a full menu and if it was busier but it was a very limited, preselected menu and honestly, not very busy considering it was valentines day. I counted 26 tables plus bar seating and some of the tables were even empty. When wait staff would come out to the dining area, everyone's attention would shift to them in hopes of catching their attention.

I would not attend or recommend attending any sort of dining event here to anyone. There are some very clear organization issues that the customers as well as the waiters/waitresses are paying the price for. It was incredibly frustrating to experience for a special occasion. The only silver lining was our waitress had some funny jokes even though she was clearly frustrated herself."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcjY3VGZREAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Me and the family had a blast here, would definitely come back. So many things to do, was a bit overwhelming at first. We couldn't find krampus which makes me wonder if we missed some areas. Sword fighting, archery, and knife throwing lines could be better defined, they were all over the place and sometimes you get bumped off when the employees tell you you're not in the invisible line. We'll come back for sure"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3aHJfWF93RRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,So much fun. Do the quests and bring cool gamer people who will play along. You get what you give to the park. I can't wait to come back to play and watch the park grow.

We can't wait to go again!!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJMDlqSWR3EAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Step into another world, wander the grounds and meet the actors as you complete whatever level of the quest you choose. At this point, food options are very limited, but we could tell that will change in the near future as lots of construction is still under way. They had lots of fire pits to visit and get warm. Tons to see, fantastic atmosphere, great actors. Look forward to seeing it when it's done. Fun group event."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbkoyR0p3EAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,I was blown away by my experience here. The characters were so kind and helped direct me and my group exactly where we needed to go. Tons of vendors and the nicest people in the world. 100% will be back.

The actors really got into their roles and it was obvious that they all loved their jobs. The actual location looks like it is out of a fairytale. Please anyone reading this, support this place and keep it around. This is a one of a kind experience, and everyone should go to Evermore, at least once. At 15$ a person, this place is a steal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNUpfMlRREAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,Our company party was held here and it was a great night.  It was a great experience and fun atmosphere.  The Christmas lights were still up and it made for an excellent evening. I enjoyed the train ride and got a great view of the grounds. I really like that there were fire pits throughout and we were able to stop and warm up for a minute.  I will definitely visit again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvdVkzTWFnEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,Really Cool Theme Park. My kids who are 6 & 9 loved it. They enjoyed going around and getting the little quests to do. I wish the characters were a little more forthcoming with answers or what to do. The Characters did great though at there parts. Very well done. We went on a Saturday night and the later and busier it got the lines to talk to people were annoying. Same with the axe & bow tables the lines took forever. So I'd suggest going during the week.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbF95LVdnEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"I went on a date here during the Aurora event. And it was absolutely splendid! There was so much to go look at around the park, and there were tons of people to go around and talk to! My date isn't much of a nerd, but she loved the Christmas theme and all the activities to do including archery and knife throwing. The waits for the activities were fairly small so there wasn't much waiting around and more exploring this beautiful park. 10/10 would recommend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNMGY2eFJ3EAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Great place for nerds to go out on quests, make friends, see some beautiful decor, and throw axes.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHZ2JLVXZBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,One of my favorite places to go and immerse my family in a well thought out land of fantasy and adventure.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZb3BiODJRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,This is the closest thing to a Disney theam park quality that I have ever seen! There is so much detail and craftsmanship in everything in that park. It's true that some parts of it are still under construction but I wouldn't let that stop you from going!  If anything it makes you more excited to go again and see what's new! The architecture is absolutely incredible and the actors know their story well!  I'm 30 plus years old and I was extremely impressed by the Evermore Park!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTMWQ2Wll3EAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"I think it's definitely worthwhile and would have been a lot of fun if we weren't in a rush. Our experience was about a 3-star, but I think it definitely can be a 5-star experience if you give yourself enough time. I give it 4-stars overall because I want to see improvement in their customer care and outdoor lighting.

Evermore is an immersive experience akin to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Universal Studios), Fantasyland (Disney), and Ghost Town (Knott's Berry Farm). There are a lot of characters to interact with, but no thrill rides. (There was a train ride, but it broke own the day we went, possibly due to weather.) It's definitely something you'll want hours to explore. I recommend getting the park map when you get there and seeing what is going on.

It was a lot of fun once we got settled in. But they do a pretty bad job of preparing new guests for the experience, so the first 10-15 minutes we're really stressful for us. Make sure you have plenty of time before any scheduled events.

We checked in at the front gate and had to work out what to do to get refunded on our train tickets. We had bought the additional Christmas Carol experience and they hadn't given us any information at the gate on how to redeem it. Luckily, we found someone else doing the Christmas Carol experience who told us where and how to redeem our tickets. Unfortunately, we ended up missing the beginning of the performance because of how long it took us to figure out what was going on.

We had about 30 people attend our Christmas Carol performance, which was probably the most it could handle. It was definitely hard for everyone to get the full experience. Additionally, someone had a double wide stroller, which slowed the group down a couple of times because of really narrow doorways and the uneven/poorly-lit pathways. It would have been fine, but the actors weren't trained on how to help someone with a stroller/wheelchair. It seemed pretty ADA and handicap accessible."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJdlo2TE1BEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Go. Just go. This place is awesome and suitable for all ages! The staff are awesome and really the food and beverages aren't too expensive. We had a bread bowl with soup and hot Apple cider. My wife and kids enjoyed it a lot.

Side note: If you're getting there when it opens up. People like to go left. However, if you go right and around to the archery and axe throwing you'll be alone for awhile! Which is nice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHeHBxWVhREAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,So much fun cute props lots of cool vendors food lines were really long and the haunted house isn't included with the general admission and train rides sold out the day before the event but overall we loved it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJMHJUMHBnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,Although it was bitter cold we spent 4 hours interacting with characters and completing quests.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBc2NtSkRREAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"I attended the pre opening party for Evermore park and was overall very impressed.  The front of the park which was mostly finished looked fantastic.  There were plenty of actors, animal handlers, musicians and performers to keep you entertained all evening. I was entertained for the 4 hours that I stayed at the park.  The only downside was how much of the park was still unfinished, and sometimes I felt unsure of what I should be doing. Overall it was a great experience and I am very glad that I went."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwamVXcVdnEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"I want to love it BUT the park still has a lot of room to improve. The line to get in was unnecessarily long for having bought tickets and signed the waiver online. We waited 55 minutes before even getting inside. They needed more people at the entrance.
And no one let you know what to do once you were inside. I had watched some YouTube videos before hand and thought we were given character cards and an intro quest but after the long wait all we got was a map. So we started just by walking around aimlessly and exploring. It wasnt til 30 minutes later we realized the intro quest was on the back of the map! Would have been nice if the employee who gave us the map had told us that! And no one told us how to distinguish park employees from guests. (Because some guests had really elaborate costumes...) We figured out over time it was the people with green pendants.
But the BIG disappointment was after completing the first quest we went to the kettle cafe and turned in our gold to level up! The next quest we assumed would be something different but they simply handed us the same quest again and said they would have different ones in the future. They did say that there were quests to join each guild but it just felt like there was no reward or sense of accomplishment for that first quest. And the guild we wanted to join (the dragon trainers) we were told were ""sick"" or infected and were currently hold up in a building that was boarded up. So not sure if that meant we were supposed to find a way in side as part of the game or that the employees were just not working that night. We didnt stay to find out. We soon left after that after about 2 hrs.
But as I said I want to love it. The park did have a few things going for it:
The decorations and details were really awesome.
The actors characters seemed really cool and the ones we interacted with were nice and did a good job.
I would have loved if there was more to do. Bottom line all the quests (at least the ones available) seemed to be go somewhere talk to someone. And alot of the time the actors were surrounded by other guests so you had to wait to talk to them. The main areas to interact were crowded.
For the cost price I dont think it is worth it... Yet. I think they need some more actual attractions. It felt kinda empty. If you absolutely love DnD you could probably go spend 5 hours there and enjoy it completely. But if you prefer solo RPG videogames I'd say spend the money on those instead. For me and my wife it cost $64 bucks and now I kinda wish I had just bought a new videogame lol. But if you are considering going give it a shot and hope you enjoy!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHd05QT0V3EAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"As always, a gorgeous and memorable experience! Lines and wait times were much longer than I've seen, which was a bummer... but we will be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMk5DOHJRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"It was fun and entertaining.  They ran out of food at the end of the night, but we did wait until after 9 pm to request food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTdm9fUVJnEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"We visited for the first time during the 2020 Christmas season.  Highly recommend paying extra for the Christmas Carol experience, it was amazing! The acting - especially the parts of Scrooge and Charles Dickens - was excellent, better than we expected. The way you follow the characters through the park to different locations as the story unfolds was unique and so much fun! There were indoor and outdoor settings - some of which are only accessible for Christmas Carol attendees. The Christmas Carol experience was slightly interactive also, which made it even better.  Our young adult children all loved it, as did we. We would go back again for that alone! The Christmas Carol takes about an hour (we wouldn't have wanted it any shorter, we enjoyed it so much), so we didn't have as much time as we had hoped to see the rest of the park before it closed. So, if you are doing the Christmas Carol, be sure to leave extra time before or after to enjoy the rest of the park. The archery and ax throwing ends at 9:30, and the lines were a little long before that, so we didn't do either. Most of the actor characters we came into contact with were easy to talk to, and we really enjoyed our interactions with them! But some were too preoccupied with their interactions with other actors/characters to talk to us, so that was a little disappointing. The costuming is excellent, and the overall feeling within the park is magical.  Sometimes it was hard to tell between the paid actors and visiting patrons who dressed up, but the glowing necklaces helped. We enjoyed the fire dancers and the puppet show, and the hot chocolate was delicious! If you dress warm, the cold isn't so bad, and there are plenty of fire pits throughout the park to warm up by. We will definitely be going back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHaW9qTnR3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"I want to be super clear: I love Evermore. I've gone 3 times now and had a great time every time, except for this last one during Lore 2021.

The Haunt was a fun idea, except the time we reserved to go through it didn't matter at all. We spent an hour waiting in line to go in, far and away after our reserved time. Well, we thought, at least we get to go to the second haunt, maybe that one won't be as busy! Nope. We spent more time in line, then the second haunt that we paid for was the EXACT SAME haunt again, with a slightly different ""quest"". The quest was different by about 2 or 3 different lines in the script from the actors (who were wonderful, as always, but still). We were very disappointed with the haunt experience.

We also got combo tickets which included food vouchers. Guess what we did? Waited in line another 45 minutes for sub-par food. I think I saw about 2 people in the back making the food for hundreds of patrons. (Absolutely not the workers' fault!) Evermore is simply not equipped to handle this many people.

Perhaps if they limited the number of patrons in the park, so there are less people in general, it would help? I would happily pay more to enter if I knew I wouldn't spend literally 1/2 the time I spent there in lines. It's either that or bump up staffing to accommodate all of the people there.

I love love love Evermore with all my heart, and I so badly want them to succeed, but I wish some of the energy they put into their spectacular sets and costumes and actors also went towards straight up logistics. Even the bathroom situation is lacking. Only three stalls in the women's bathroom? No wonder there is always a line going around the building.

They tried something new, which is commendable! But in practice, it clearly wasn't the experience that was marketed to us.

I'm hoping that for the Winter theme they'll have learned a few things from the what they tried with Lore. I have every confidence that they'll try to improve the experience for their guests who love them and want them to succeed! And I'm looking forward to hopefully coming back to edit this review after we visit in the winter. I love Evermore!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJcU9ERklBEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Off to a great start. Lots more to come. The park talent is wonderfully engaging and pleasant. Some of the grounds are still under construction but what's there is imaginative and enchanting. We saw a reptile show and a bird show, live music and festive lighting. Looking forward to watching them grow. Our family had a great time and will be going back.

More food options and a liquor license would work wonders for them, and bring more revenue. Not holding out hope for beers in Utah county."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHd3JtOFBnEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Tonight was way more fun than I expected! My daughter and I really got into the quests and finished the three main ones and lots of little ones, joined a guild (the adventure guild of course), watched a magic show and the fire dancers, and ended the evening with a decent cup of hot chocolate.
We bought the combo deal, with entry into the park, the two main quests which really gets you three, the train ride, and a meal with a drink. It was a bit spendy, but it was cheaper to buy the combo than buying everything separately, and in the end it was so much fun. Totally worth the price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdllfOGpBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Enjoyed my time here from a visual perspective. very well thought out as far as their displays and attractions. We went during the winter time during the Christmas festivities and got their activity pass.

Wasn‚Äôt particularly impressed with their staff. They seemed to hire highschool kids who do cosplay as a hobby. Many didn‚Äôt seem to treat it like a job. Although they were supposed to be in character I saw a lot of them on their phones and not really taking pride in their work. As the face of evermore I really expected a bit more in that capacity.

Additionally the ‚Äúice skating‚Äù was a complete waste of money. You walk onto a cold sheet of plastic with zero ice on it. They advertise it‚Äôs not true ice skating but this isn‚Äôt skating at all. It‚Äôs walking on plastic and that‚Äôs the experience. period. I am proficient at ice skating so it‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt know how to skate. If I went again I‚Äôd pay for general admission and that‚Äôs it.

The food was also insanely long lines (45 minutes, and this was after being told they ran out of food and we needed to come back in an hour) for great value freezer food that was reheated. It was worse quality than food I make for myself and I have pretty low standards. (Truly watched them rip open great value frozen fries and put them in the fryer, certainly tasted like it too)

Beyond walking through the place and admiring the architecture don‚Äôt expect much from anything else that‚Äôs offered. Still cool though!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwbk5Xb01nEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Evermore is an MMORPG video game brought to life. Within Evermore, you meet its citizens, learn about their history and struggles and complete tasks for them while exploring their world. For the muggles out there, think of it as an elaborate scavenger hunt.

The actors are what make this park happen. Throughout Evermore you'll find citizens who are either quest givers or general NPCs with helpful info. Most of them are great at what they do and play off of anything you say quite well. There are four guilds you can join and each have tasks for you to complete as initiation. We joined the Dragon Trainers after finding the elf rangers to be too snooty (and also not the best actors). I loved the actor who led the Dragon Trainers. He had a huge history of dragons in his repertoire and was just cheerful and believable. I honestly felt honored when he initiated us. It truly felt like I was playing WoW. We had quests that led to other quests that led to other quests. Some were for the overarching story and others were simple tasks like selling a magic item for a merchant. Some NPCs sat around telling ghost stories, acting out tales or singing songs.

There were a few cons, but all are things that are easy to improve and will hopefully be fixed soon. Firstly, the park itself is not complete and they do nothing to hide this. During the night this is fine because the darkness and choice lighting hide all the under construction parts. During the day, you can clearly see metal conduit, wood piles, orange safety cones, rebar, etc. piled in certain areas of the park. They do nothing to hide this and it kills the immersion. There's also little things they could easily hide like in the mausoleum there was a speaker you could clearly see that was generating monster sounds, in the aviary there was a giant A/C unit and in the middle of the field is an electrical box.

We attended on a Monday night early in the Lore season and it feels like they aren't at 100% yet. It was open 6-10 pm. We arrived just after 6 and clearly they weren't ready. We didn't receive a map when we entered or any instruction. We wandered around and saw employees/actors not yet on their game or ready to interact. This is where we were able to focus on all the poor immersion areas because we basically wandered aimlessly the first hour. However, even after dark when everyone was in place and quests began rolling, there were still huge areas with no NPCs or quest givers.

When we finally did track down a map, we saw on the back a huge task list of things to do and next to it it said, ""your first quest!"" We spent a lot of time completing these tasks only to turn it in in the end and learn the ""first quest"" was a smaller thing hidden in the image on the page and all the tasks we completed were ""just a scavenger hunt"" with apparently no reward. I think there was just a miscommunication somewhere with this but it was a bummer.

Another improvement that could be made is better marking for who is an NPC/citizen of Evermore versus players. They encourage guests to come in costume and many of us who attended were but that made it difficult for me to know ""is that elf over there someone I can talk to or another player like me?"" The quest givers wear a glowing light necklace which is great but the tavern dwellers and fairies and monsters do not.

Overall, I had a blast and LOVE this concept. I think they are working towards an app or some system to track your progress as a player and that would be really awesome!

I would recommend Evermore but not going out of your way for it. I don't think you should buy a plane ticket to SLC drive the hour to Pleasant Grove and get a hotel to attend, but it's worth a day drive or is definitely something to do if you're visiting Utah anyway.

I'm very curious to see how far the park will come in two years. I think there's something great here but kinks are still being worked out."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTdnZ6d25BRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"We went here the day after Christmas 2020 and took our four little kids with us. The kids say their favorite thing was the fire dancers that went on every hour. They also enjoyed the bird and reptile show and the knife throwing. I really like the architecture of the buildings and the lights were beautiful. We also rode the train around the park and had fun looking at all the lights and buildings.  If there was one point of criticism, it had to be the radio station being played on the train ride, it wasn't really consistent with the theme of the park and broke the immersion in the park's atmosphere.
The characters we talked to were all interesting with their own stories to tell. Definitely going to spend more time talking to characters and doing quests when we go without little kids. The other visitors were also very friendly and sometimes it was hard to tell them from the Evermore characters if it weren't for the glowing pendants that the actors wore.
The food we had there was very good and service was great.
Overall, a top-notch experience which I believe will only get better over time and the more we go back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcDRIZFpREAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,Wow! What a great place! Went here for my cousins birthday and once we really got into the role playing we had a blast! Food was pricey but good and the whole setup was very cool!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eDY2ZUN3EAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Literally my favorite place in Utah. It's simply magical. And in the fall, it transforms into a Halloween Village that's incredibly decorated. The best ‚ú®spooky vibes‚ú® I keep coming back - can't stay away!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJa3RfMHNBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"This place is so much fun, for literally the whole family! Dont waste your money on haunted houses this place is the whole package for basically the same price you'd spend at a haunted house, except you actually get to get involved and find clues to solve a mystery!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNd3VHODd3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"There is no shortage of entertainment to find here! Each season brings new excitement; whether it is the scares and haunting of Lore, the lights and cheer of Aurora, or any other event, you are sure to find fun at Evermore!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3c01qZkRBEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,It was a lot of fun wandering through what  feels like a fantasy land and they have little quests to keep you busy. I think evermore has a lot of potential for becoming really awesome. A few things I felt they could work on is putting quests together that actually gets you somewhere with an end point instead of running it back and forth between characters for the sake of keeping you busy. Overall it's worth experiencing.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtb2J1LXJBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"What a beautiful winter adventure! Evermore is such a fun place with a choose-your-own-adventure vibe. My hubby and I spoke to Tundra Maximus the miner and explored the village and even a castle while we picked up side quests along the way. We warmed up with a little hot cider on our way to find Winter Weavers (elegant winter elves!). There were local vendors features handmade costume pieces, sculptures, etc. We wanted to free the ice giant but our dinner reservation came first, so we hustled to Vander's Keep. Oh my was the food delicious! Samantha Fox, our server, let us know the beef stew was inspired by a 19th century recipe and braised for hours. My husband loved his pork chops and I devoured my venison with chili-citrus ginger glaze, which was served a perfect medium rare. The classic cocktails were on point too. We wrapped up the night with a little archery and  headed home wanting to come back to enjoy more of everything."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlLUx1alBREAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,Evermore was amazing! We had a lot of fun interacting with the actors. The quests kept us entertained for the whole night.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeUpUMWJREAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"This was such a great experience. We came during the summer mythos event. We spent two nights here and had a blast. There is still so much more to explore and interact with that I wish I could spend at least two more evenings here.
There were a lot of fun actors, but the pirates and bards are especially wonderful."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVdWR6Y19nRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"This is one of the greatest places I have been too, immersive, great story lines, amazing detail and spectacular value. I will be returning and cant wait for their next expansions"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvb3ViQ2xnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"We had a blast coming with 4 children. They had fire dancers, exotic birds and fun interactive sculptures. Definitely worth checking out as a family or on a fun date!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMweE9PcFlREAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Pros:
-talented staff - a lot of them are really funny and really fun to interact with
-great decorations - lots of real old wood and brick and leather
-a few pretty cool animatronics

Cons:
-quests are both difficult to find to begin and pretty railroaded
-park was crowded, making it hard to talk to the NPCs
-food and drink is wildly expensive, for example: $3 for a 12 oz bottle of rootbeer"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhZzkyMmNREAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"We had so much fun exploring the park and doing a couple quests! We were only there for about two hours. We brought our 4 year old daughter and she absolutely LOVED all the characters and how so many people were dressed up! She made me promise she could dress up as a fairy or pirate next time we go.

We did find starting out to be a bit difficult with the acorn quest from the fairy, but after asking for a hint we were finally able to find our first one and know what we were looking for! Finding the rest was MUCH easier after finding the first one! Everyone was so nice and it was so cool! I loved seeing all the other visitors fully enjoying themselves in full cosplay! Luckily there were enough people not in cosplay that we didn't feel awkward or stick out. I'm not talented enough to put together such wonderful costumes.

If you happen to be in a wheelchair or a knee scooter (I was on a knee scooter) there are a lot of cobblestone areas and one area that is a little bit of looser gravel, so be prepared for some bumpy areas! Totally manageable, but obviously is a bit harder than just walking. Definitely looking forward to a trip without the knee scooter! Hahah

Also the tiny bottle of fairy dust you get from taking a picture of all the acorns is one of the cutest things ever!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3dE0yRlpnEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,This was such a unique experience. The more you are willing to get into it and play along the more you will get out of it. Amazing buildings and scenery. The actors and accents were believable and their makeup and costumes were even better. You truly feel your you've been transported to a different world when you walk through the entrance!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNncjUzQ3Z3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"We ended up going to Evermore Park tonight and although it was not completely finished it was a great experience! The details are extraordinary and talking to the characters provides insight into the story of Evermore without giving too much away.

My kids had a blast running in between characters sending messages going on quests and collecting items. It was amazing to see them in an immersive environment and being part of a theatrical experience.

The character spent time with my kids and showed interest in learning about them and the characters that they had created for their cosplay. Further they helped them to feel as if they were part of the experience. Where else can you spend time with characters and have them remember who you are at the end of the night? This doesn't happen but at Evermore it did. It was so cool to have 5 6 7 or even 8 characters talking to my kids and myself at one time! It was extraordinary!

Justin the manager was an amazing man and went out of his way to make the night special for my son who is celebrating his birthday! When this park is completed, it is my opinion that it will rival Disney and be destination for people all over North America not just Utah.

This park is not just for dress up and taking part in a cool Theatre experience but is also an educational opportunity for students and adults. Learning about the animals, the gardens, the mythology and various historical aspects of the park is fascinating. The characters use dialogue that is rich with vocabulary and the actors take the time to teach the meaning of the words to the young people that are there. My kids walked away having learned new words and their meanings. This is a fun and educational place and I cannot wait to see how the educational Outreach programs develop! As an educator myself, I would love to partner with Evermore and help them develop these programs!

I was astounded by the details of this park and cannot wait for it to be complete! It is hard to understand what is going on at first but if you are open and talk to the characters and listen to what they're saying and ask questions- you will have a delightful time. I highly recommend that everyone give this Park a shot.

If you are a perfectionist you may want to wait until the park is officially open before you attend. I hope that many people come and experience Evermore."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeDhHOEVREAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,Excellent venue. It was cold but it was so worth it. There are pits set up all over the property so you can get warm at every stop. It was amazing and must be seen
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrMy1mXzlBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"I took my kids aged 10, 8, and 5. They were a little unsure and shy at first, but then they warmed up and didn't want to leave at the end of the night. They said they had a blast! It was a little confusing how to get started but once we all got the hang of it we were having a lot of fun.  I think it would be a little more fun for adults without kids because you wouldn't have them holding you up at all and could really get into the intricacies of the tasks. I'm looking forward to coming back another time without kids! The actors were great and the scenery is amazing! The is still some construction happening but it doesn't detract too much and there is still plenty to see."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMXNLTUdREAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Absolutely love this place! The atmosphere is great, workers, artists, vendors are wonderful! Need eating options or snacks available throughout the park. Annual visits will continue! Love ‚ù§"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycjVialhBEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Phenomenal. Everyone there was fantastic! The food in the stands could use a little work, but I'm not complaining that much. 10/10 experience. Tell The Whiff I said hello!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNza1k3VkZBEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Do you love role playing, and/or role playing games? Do you like acting as a character, or watching people perform? Do you want to go on a quest to join one of several guilds and have fun knowing everyone around you is in the same fantasy world you are in? Go here!

Everyone was warm and friendly (unless their characters weren't). They presented quests, and help pull you into the world. You learned about these people and these stories, and could interact with the characters, and they held solid and true. I would take over conversations (As Finnius Feyweather.. Irish accent lol) and I would ask for stories, or ask for information, or ask for a song, and they never let me down, or broke character.

The musical dwarves, and wondering minstrel are must sees! They turned everything up to 11! The animal show was fun, and I even learned a few things! The park changes a few times a year, and I'm from Oregon and definitely plan on making a weekend trip down to see each one!

Great time for all ages! HUZZAH!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHb0lubW5BRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"This place was awesome! It got pretty crowded once it got dark but when we first got there it was really fun to look around at all the different booths and the scenery was beautiful. One part I really liked was the parrot named Max who could talk, dance and laugh with guests.

One thing I think could be improved is information about the events, shows, quests, and guilds should be more accessible and easier to understand. I asked an actor what a quest was she said to ‚Äújust find one.‚Äù I was pretty confused because at that point I didn‚Äôt even know what a quest was until I read other reviews. However, I still had a super fun time and I would definitely go again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaXVyN0Z3EAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"So FUN!! There were a ton of people there and both parking lots were pretty full but it was a big enough place and outdoors so we felt safe and comfortable with covid (although our whole party is also vaccinated). Still lots of lines to talk to different towns people, but you can potentially listen to the conversations of those ahead of you and save time.

It took our, not shy but not super outgoing, group a second to get going, but once we figured out some of the things that we could ask for, (or interact with characters at the park to do- like join a guild, do a good deed/help someone on a quest, earn gold-all the townspeople pretty much have it and will give you tasks to earn it, trade items (we brought a bag of rocks and gems and traded with a witch and a pirate for different coins and other things) we were quickly on our way to having a great time!!!)

Aside from the adventures there are craft stands to buy from, food to purchase (both in the resturaunt and in stands in the park,  arial silk/fire stick throwing/animal shows to watch, archery/hatchet throwing/battle arena foam battles to participate in, walking the grounds to see all the cool buildings and effects they have and continue to add, and there is some fun people watching to do too!

We saw all ages (from itty bitty to getting up there in years) dressed up and participating with great amounts of enjoyment!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteTUyZ1ZBEAE,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"It was a nice night visit, for a discount price. Weather was good, but dry. None of the little tent shops were open. Lots of colored lights. Maybe once is enough..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3dk5EXzVnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a theme park.,"Welcome to the magical realm of Evermore!
A space between our world and the magical, where something peculiar is happening..
We went in with no idea what was in store for us, and there really is no way to describe such a place of wonder!
This is only a fragment of what you'll encounter there.
There's so much to see and do we see having to go back for a second time!
It was an amazing experience being part of the story and figuring out what was happening in the realm!
I loved dressing up and playing my own role, and next time I'll actually be prepared.
If you're into the magical and mysticism, or not, I highly recommend you go check out @evermorepark and experience it for yourself!"

It was a very quaint and nicely decorated restaurant.  It had white linen tablecloths and napkins, nice music and everything was very clean. They had a nice wine list and we ordered some chardonnay as an appetizer....and then an actual appetizer. For the main fare we ordered beef wellington and chicken caprese. The food was absolutely delicious! Chef Magdy came out and spoke with us. He was absolutely charming!! He comped us free desserts, which were also delicious, and made us feel like we were eating with an old friend. We dressed for the occasion, but it is not necessary at all. It's a very comfortable, fine dining experience. Give it a try."

Our dinner started with complementary bread and butter. After that, we had a salad with a delicious dressing.
Our main course was a dish of quail in special wild mushrooms sauce, a dish of a rack of lamb which I highly recommended, a dish of snapper with homemade cajun spice, and the venison on the cherry port sauce.
For dessert, we had this delicious tiramisu.
Magdy the owner is a very skilled chef and a friendly welcoming person.

We did come in the late afternoon, so the location was not busy.
The staff that we encountered was efficient, but not cheerful, but not rude either.
The atmosphere was not overly welcoming and dim lighting. It was a cloudy day, so maybe they rely on sunshine to help out?
The location was clean and restrooms were clean, with no baby changing station in the women's room.

They offer food, and drinks at the field at fair prices and the field paint is reasonably priced also.

Their trails are true nature trails  Do not expect to walk on paved paths in most areas. They have self Explore caves which are amazing short experiences.  You do have to go get a permit to enter these areas but there is no charge and it is only for your safety.  Extremely dog friendly!!!! I will be coming here annually. This is definitely my new family vacation spot.

We went on the X cave, which was a little disappointing for an experienced cave tour lover, but a nice introduction to caving. Kids will especially love it since you're IN  A CAVE! haha. There are only a couple of highlights and not really anything kiddos will hurt if they touch (although touching is discouraged) Quite chilly inside. You might want a jacket. There are lots of above ground trails and the ones we wandered down were quite easy. The lodge is more upscale, with a nice stone fireplace in the lobby. We didn't stay there, so not sure of that experience. The road leading in is slow and winding. So take your time."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaTVuQ0JREAE,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"Decided to explore Carter caves and found a beautiful park along a beautiful drive through green forest canopy. Park had many spots to go and see, and cave tours were reasonably priced ($8-10 for adults). We took the Cascade tour and enjoyed how our guide took her time explaining history, cave formation, and the flora and fauna of the caves. Time and money well spent, will definitely come back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNaV9uUlR3EAE,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"Quite a few things to do here. Stop at the Welcome Center first to get some ideas (and tickets to Cascade Caves or X Caves) and to see a natural bridge and a cave. There is a lodge (with restaurant) and cottages just up the road for overnight stays. Plenty of hiking trails, with more natural bridges and a few waterfalls scattered about. Makes for an adventurous weekend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bHRLYWdnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,They have a beautiful little lake. It looks a little run down as some of the buildings are just left sitting empty. We picked up a lot of trash kyaking around. But it was a pretty calm little lake.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNFlDOXRBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"We had a neighbor tell us about Carter Caves so we decided to do a day trip here. During our visit we toured X Cave, Horn Hollow, and Cascade Cave. The park was very clean and well organized. We didn‚Äôt know what to do and where to go at first but were quickly and easily able to find staff that showed us the ropes. Our first tour was with Tristan at the X Caves. Tristan was informative and the Cave was interesting overall we enjoyed it. The only thing we wish he would have done differently is slow down . We moved so quickly through the cave that it felt like at times we were trying to keep up with the group instead of getting to enjoy the experience. Our next tour was a self guided tour to Horn Hollow. We were informed that we needed to bring flashlights with us so we purchased some at the gift shop. The permit process was easy however finding the cave not so much. They literally circled it on the map and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs somewhere around here‚Äù and to stay on the green trail. We kept walking and walking at one point we saw a couple walking down what appeared to be a creek bed and wondered to ourselves is that the cave entrance? We pulled out our phones to Google it, it was. Then once we got to the mouth of the cave we saw that it was flooded. We were not aware that the mouth of the cave was going to be in a creek bed and the water at the mouth was already at shin level. Not wanting to spend the rest of that day in wet shoes and socks we decided to not venture inside. Our last tour of the day was to Cascade Cave. Our tour guide was Skylar. Skylar has a family history when it comes to this cave and it is clear that he is both knowledgeable and passionate about it. He has a great personality and really took his time sharing the cave with us. He also told us about some of the other caves and tours we would not have known about otherwise and would love to check out in the future. We were so thankful that our tour was with him as he really made the experience. Overall it was our favorite cave of the day."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbjk2d0p3EAE,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"Carter Caves Campgrounds State Park Adventure. We stayed at the campground this December in our Toy Hauler TT for five days.
They have 33 miles of hiking trails. 5 caves for exploring a 3 Natural Bridges that are spectacular. The campgrounds have full to primitive hookups. No water in the off season they do have electric. 20-30-50 amp. Two large bathhouses which one is open souring off season. Play grounds and a put put mini golf. Ice machines store is open during the offseason.

Welcome lodge is very nice it‚Äôs also where you will need to get permits for cave exploring.

Dogs are allowed on trails but not the caves. 2 people minimum to explore.

2000 acres of exploring with a small lake for fishing.
Must definitely a beautiful place anytime of the season.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxbE1hWTZnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"Camped here for 4 days. Had an absolute great time. Lots to do from mild to adventurous. They keep the park in excellent shape even weedeating the trails. Some activities can get a little expensive with large families, but its not something you do everyday and there's enough free things to do to make the difference. 2 things keep it from a 5 star rating. 1. THE SHOWERS WERENT CLEANED THE ENTIRE TIME WE WERE THERE. 2. They need to control the mice around the dumpster area. Other than that, its definitely on my return list, with my own can of Lysol."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bUttanNnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"Awesome park. The guided caves are cool, the unguided caves are cool, the trails are cool, the land bridges are cool, and just the overall place is just fun to be around. I stayed in the cottages, and they are nice for one big or two small families. Well kept. Definitely recommend.

If you come, make sure to check out Horn Hollow cave. There‚Äôs a short little crevice near the main entrance of the cave, and if you follow that, it narrows and narrows. Prepare to be crawling on your stomach in an underground creek. You‚Äôll need to be pretty narrow and pretty flexible (I‚Äôm 6‚Äô and 180 lbs. and I made it though with some difficulty). It goes back a good 200 feet, until it opens up on this huge underground waterfall fueling the creek. It‚Äôs almost as big as the one in Cascade. I‚Äôm not sure if this water fall is well-known, but it‚Äôs well worth the difficulty of reaching it. If you‚Äôre up for an adventure, I highly recommend it."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhOEtlcUV3EAE,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"The access road is narrow and winding with nonexistent shoulders in places. The campsites are good sized and most have shade. There are a lot of amenities including a riding stable, cave tours, and a putt putt golf course. The utilities are oddly set up with one power pole for two sites with one 50 amp and 2 30 amp outlets. The power poles are also somewhat randomly places so depending on the site you will need an extension cord."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOHNEVTZRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"So it's very confusing but we stayed at the Carter Caves Campground not the resort or cabins.
We arrived one day early figured we would try our luck. We were met on the office by a disinterested kid. Once we got through that, we discovered that our sight #8, had the electric pedestal aprox 75' from the site.
We returned to the office and were moved to sight #3. Once we backed in, we discovered that the electric pedestal had 20 or 50 Amp. No 30.
Back again and moved into #6. It worked but I had to back all the way to the end of the pad and my power cord just made it.
Water took two hoses to reach and had to wrap to the opposite side of the camper.
We had a nice view but the picnic table was not usable due the the slope.
The showers were ok but the curtain bottom was covered with mold.
Overall a busy Campground, dogs and some guy in a tow truck that liked to let everyone know he had an air horn.
The park overall was beautiful and the hiking was great!
Just be warned to really look over the registration as it's not your typical campgroud."

Had a good time on trails with my people though. Will not be back to rent a cabin."

Was a gorgeous place to see the fall color.  I really want to leave more time to do the longer trail here, only thing I noticed is one trail smelled like a septic system on a portion that wrapped just below the cabins.   I bet the water dripping from the rocks there was sewage.

But other than that this place is excellent.  Next time I‚Äôll check the lodge out."

The buffet was great and had three entree choices, chicken, prime rib and something else.  A good sale, mashed taters, Brussels sprouts, green beans and rolls were other choices.  The desert bar had chocolate candies, strawberries covered in chocolate, cupcakes, banana pudding and a chocolate cake so yummy.
Mike the magician made the event interactive and the made the night fun.  I laughed until my jaws hurt.  We had a good time."

The lodge rooms are a bit dated, but clean with private porches overlooking the trees. The hiking trails and cave tours are AWESOME, though. No pictures can do these justice. We checked out both X-Cave and Cascade Cave, as well as a couple different trails. It was a bit rainy / cloudy when we visited, so we'll definitely be back to do more hiking when the weather is better!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpM2VlY09nEAE,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,Such a fun place! Tons of trails of varied difficulty. It's a lot better in the summer than fall/winter because leaves obscure the trails so it's easy to go the wrong way in the colder seasons. You'll need a caving permit to actually explore the caves or take one of the guided tours. We really like the amount of trails you can go to and there's enough open space that you don't feel like you're hiking right on top of another group.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycXNqX09REAE,A Google Maps review about a resort hotel.,"We camped here, went in three of the caves, and hiked a ton of the trails. I highly recommend it all. The caves were cool, but especially the Horn Hollow cave that we got a permit to explore. The trails, except the old golf course, were beautiful. Make sure you find and explore around all the arches on the map."

Eagle Harbor is located right accross the bay and walking distance to Penninsula State Park. When we entered the property it was beautifully places homes giving you a royal feel of a town. The homes B&Bs are well kept and looks eye pleasing. Upon checking in the host was very friendly and informative about door county. They made us feel home. He check us in and off we went to our room Tilla. Tilla was the 1st room up the stairs on your left. Room was rather small but well designed and very cozy. The antique looks gave it a very stylish english look. The washroom was large enough and had a sky light to it. B&B main building was well decorated (pics attached) and well kept. This beautiful B&B was one of the best we have visited so far. Their breakfast was really good with some freshly baked chocolate Croissant, Cherry Yogurt, Juices Cereals and much more. Their toiletery items were good as well. Very good smelling and nice in quality. This was the best experince for us we felt right at home. Coziest B&B ever. Don't wait make your bookings right now."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvaDZXWG1BRRAB,A Google Maps review about a children's amusement centre.,"Honestly I was not impressed, the kids loved it (8, 5, 2yrs) but it felt VERY make-shift. Soda and water machines were broken, only had pricey bottled drinks and no outside drinks allowed (really...?) Pizza wasn't too bad though my pepperoni tasted like it was cooked alongside some pineapples. The arcade games are ridiculously expensive and considering they only have like 8 games their ticket/toys costs we're outrageous. 5 tickets for a Tootsie roll that I just paid 3 dollars to get for my son to play 2 games (and now have 2 tokens/credits I can't use because the lowest cost is 4 credits most are 5) is ridiculously! 3 bucks for a small tootsies roll? wow... How about 1 ticket for 1 Tootsie roll, c'mon. They are LITERALLY pinching every penny possible, and it just feels very trashy. A few small adjustments could change a lot, and the cost would be minor."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDb2NDcWhRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a children's amusement centre.,"Unexpectedly exceeded my expectations! This picture of my 6 year old says it perfectly. We went there for a birthday party, and the party room (with flowers) was cute. The blow up slides, arcades and toys were all working and seemed pretty clean! The adults could play on the slides too with the kids which was so fun! There is this HUGE slide by the restrooms that took my 31 year old breath away! It was intense and made me feel like a kid again. Arcades were awesome. The kids had fun turning in their tickets. And they had a small sectioned off area for the little little kids which I would've appreciated when my 6 & 8 year old were little. We had a blast.

Ofcourse No shoes allowed if you're going to play,  so make sure you have clean socks.
They have tables and couches chairs to sit down.  There is free wifi.
There is a concession place where you can order popcorn, soda, slurpies and more. (No outside food)
The floor is soft padded for safe running if kids fall.
Families usually spend about 45 mins - 2 hours here.
For $10 it's a great deal."

We love that they have side rooms that can have a closed door party in privacy from the general bounce house and blower noise.
4 out of 5 stars because of the relatively UNSAFE foam floor tiles that were missing or loose.  I saw kids and adults tripping on the areas the two hours we were there. :("

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVaXZ1N3JnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a children's amusement centre.,"This was our first experience at Kangaroo Zoo. We came to the NSL location. We weren‚Äôt overly impressed.. It‚Äôs.. very well loved.. we‚Äôll put it that way. A few of the inflatables could definitely be replaced. They aren‚Äôt fully flown up (I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a leak or something) and have lots of wear and tear. With it not being fully inflated, it makes it hard for the kids to play in them because they fall with almost every step, especially when exiting the inflatable. The games are new and nice. The party rooms looked cute, but i just peeked in through the windows. My kids were SUPER disappointed that the ball activity wasn‚Äôt working! And the entire place could use a good cleaning for sure. Once of the couches is broken and sagging.. and multiple chairs are cracked. The tables and chairs are white, and suuper  dirty. Our kids had fun, but wanted to leave after 45 minutes. I also don‚Äôt love that I had to pay $10 for my babies to come in. They are 1 and 2, but I feel like they can‚Äôt use 98% of the equipment here. The only thing they could have really done is play with the balls.. but that was broken. There‚Äôs also no toddler area, so I‚Äôm confused why I had to pay $5 each for them."

The nerf ball guns weren‚Äôt working on huge jungle gym snd a few of the bounce houses weren‚Äôt full so my boys kept getting stuck. Although, they thought that it was fun to get stuck.

Perks- Looks like it would be a fun place to go to for a birthday party and the prices are very reasonable. Lots of places for parents to sit with a good view at each place.

I wanted to try the stuffed tortilla but weirdly the price on the online menu is $4 cheaper than when you go to actually order it online- a lot of menu items were the same way and I wonder if it's on purpose or if the online menu just needs to be updated? Instead, I got the mean green burrito and I loved how fresh it was- I love love love greens and veggies in a burrito and the tomatillo on top was superb. Howeverrr I really really wished the rice and beans had some more flavor! The whole concept of this burrito is amazing but I was left wanting more when the bulk of the burrito was kind of bland. I would love to try the food again- this time eating in as the space inside was so lovely."

I started with house made chai in a big ceramic mug, some of THE BEST chai I've had in my life, sweet but spicy.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cElhMDZBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a vegetarian restaurant.,"Enjoyed a nice breakfast today at Gaia. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. Our party of six was seated immediate on a Saturday morning.

Unpretentious, casual, warm interior. Small menu, but nice to have so many vegetarian and vegan options. Good to have the opportunity to try something different, outside the normal brunch fare.

I stuck with what I normally like - eggs & potatoes plus tried a fruit cup. It was a filling portion and cooked well. The potatoes were well seasoned and crispy. I also enjoyed the sourdough bread that came with my meal. The fruit was fresh and seasonal. Coffee was self-service and offered three options, with creamer available at request. I tried the Swiss chocolate brew and liked it a lot. My friend‚Äôs specialty French toasted looked amazing. It has tender sweet saut√©ed apples, cherry sauce, and almonds. Everyone had to try an apple slice - they were really good!

Worth your time and taste buds! Thanks for a good experience!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOUplM19BRRAB,A Google Maps review about a vegetarian restaurant.,"Gaia House Cafe was very nice. The decor is slightly bohemian and very cozy with mismatched chairs and tables.We went on a Tuesday at lunch and got the Gaia Tempeh Ruben and the Banh Mi sandwiches.The coffee was excellent. The staff was very pleasant and the food arrived in good time. The price seemed a little steep for sandwiches but when you get homemade pickles and kraut it makes up for it. I couldn't tell where a good place to park would be, so we parked in the Irish pub reserved area with a risk of towing.

Some things to consider: add a bit more spread on the Banh Mi as it was a little dry; add a few completely vegan options to the menu as many of the entrees are so close but then have cheese; swap out those potato chips for a cup of soup. We'll be back! Keep those homemade fermentations coming!"

I vowed that if I ever noticed that Gaia Cafe was back  in any way I would maintain patronage as I used to frequent the Cafe when I was a student at Aquinas with friends and family as I maintained a vegetarian diet the majority of my time in attendance there. Thank you for coming back, I love the changes and the maintenance of staple favorites like B.Y.O.B. and Mean Green Burrito. I personally chose the Veggie Stash as recommended by my wonderful hostess (I selected the vegan options for cream cheese and cheese toppings as in recent years I have had to cut dairy out of my diet more fully). I had a lovely experience with the self service water and coffee, enjoying the flow of the community coming in and out of the Cafe as I spent a few hours there working on a few personal and professional goals and trying a new, but also nostalgic, meal. Thank you for being back in the Grand Rapids area!!! üôè"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5NmEtTEV3EAE,A Google Maps review about a vegetarian restaurant.,"Gaia's open for in house dining and if you use to frequent the old Gaia in East Town you will be familiar with the menu. No meat is served but don't let that stop you.  We had the Paul Collins Cuban and the Jim White.  I also had a freshly, not frozen or sweetened, fruit cup. For some reason I have not been able to get a good fresh fruit cup anywhere I have been for breakfast lately.   All three, excellent, fresh and delicious. Staff was friendly and happy to serve you.  Although the interior doesn't have the same vibe as the old Gaia it has it's own charm and coolness.  Just like any diverse hip cafe people talk to each other, exchange ideas and genuinely are happy to do so while eating exceptionally good food, and for me drinking good coffee.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dmN2VXRRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a vegetarian restaurant.,"Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have anything good to say about Gaia house . When we were sat down there was paint bubbling near us, probably due to moisture trapped behind the paint. And then a leak above. It‚Äôs not really an appetizing sight.

We were told that we wouldn‚Äôt be able to have espresso or lattes because the espresso machine was down. That‚Äôs fine. What I did take issue with was the self serve coffee station. For one, the way the glasses were stored was gross. The shelves were not clean. The cups were freshly washed. I could tell because they were wet, placed rim down. So that the dust and debris on the shelving was collected on the wet rims of the cups. And whenever you picked up a cup you could see the wet rim marked it left. These cups should be dry if you‚Äôre going to store them rim down. Drying them rim down traps the moisture inside (causing an unpleasant odor and taste), and damages the shelves, and is altogether unsanitary if the shelves aren‚Äôt even clean. Storing them rim side up would be a better option in this case . They are used often enough for collecting dust to be an argument for storing them rim side down. Sanitary conditions aside, for a vegan/vegetarian place for the only milk option to be whole milk was disappointing. Consider offering milk alternatives.

The food was even more disappointing . My guest ate his omelet , but I good not stomach my food. The cornbread French toast was incredibly dry, even soaking it in the butter and syrup didn‚Äôt revive it. The potatoes tasted fine but they were stale. Since it was the only semi edible thing available to me I picked at that instead of what I ordered. I only managed to eat half of one slice of French toast and didn‚Äôt want to take it home. We came out of our way to go here after seeing it on Instagram. So it was that much more disappointing."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVNUpld3Z3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,A wonderful aquarium next to the sea. Winding circular route takes you up different levels around the main tank. Not too many big sharks in the tank - just bonnetheads and reef sharks - but it‚Äôs quite a display nonetheless with its shape. Giant pompano in there. Also a massive Asian arowana. Penguins as soon as you walk in. An incredible reef tank with seemingly every marine fish in the hobby. Everything is well cared for. Great job keeping such an old iconic aquarium up to date!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcDVxNUJ3EAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,Very informative & interesting exhibits.  Family loved it.  Highly recommend!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoalpMN2ZREAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,I loved the layout of this aquarium.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3bnZPWGdnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"We love the NE aquarium! It‚Äôs really like no other aquarium I‚Äôve ever been to. My son is 7yo, has been there at least 5 times already & still loves/gets excited about going back again! The area is beautiful as your right on the water & lots to see in the area as well.

I recommend going as early in the day as possible whenever you decide to go because anytime I‚Äôve ever gone, there is always a huge line outside as I‚Äôm leaving. If your a single parent like me & receive DTA benefits, don‚Äôt forget to show your card at any of the Boston Museums to get a SERIOUS discount (only pay $4/person up to 4 people, versus like $27/person regular price) Still surprised many forget or don‚Äôt know about that."

Volunteers were cleaning the penguin exhibit and there was an employee also holding a penguin to apply some medication to its feet and waiting for it to dry. I asked her a ton of questions and learned so much from her! I loved learning about the penguins - how their identify male from female, territory, how they are raised, etc.

Highly recommend visiting. Great place for kids and for cute dates!"

Turns out that they help rehab sea creatures and turn them back out to the sea once they prove they can sustain themselves. If they don't reach that mark, the team keeps the animals in-house. I loved the sea horses and turtles."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrc1pHVDFRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"This is up there with aquariums I've seen in other cities like Toledo.  It's smaller than the Shed aquarium in Chicago but they have a lot of nice exhibits and the staff seem passionate and knowledgeable.

I did think the admission price was sort of high for what you get (at the time of this writing it was $62 bucks for myself and my 13 year old son to get tickets).  I get that they have overhead to deal with though so what are you gonna do ya know?

They do have a pretty decent gift shop."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0X05HekNBEAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"I loved the exhibitions, the animals and everything related to wildlife. My only ""critique"" are the prices of the cafe and the store...damn not even Disney! I wanted to bring gifts to my family back in Puerto Rico but those prices!! Too much. And for the food, literally spent almost $30 for a burger when for like 75% less I paid for a entre and soda on a restuarant like two blocks away from the aquarium"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxcU5pdFBBEAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"I really liked it and it was reallt fun. I wosh there was more to see but oh well. I also think the safety there is pretty bad, youre required of course to wear a mask but it is PACKED and you're always near someone no matter what. It sorta scares me afterwards but overall it was really beautiful and fun. Sorry for the filters in the photos lol."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNy1HVGl3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"As of July 15th 2021 you do not need to make a reservation due to covid-19 so basically you can walk up to the front window and buy tickets or I guess if you want to buy them online that's okay too make sure you bring an umbrella if it's a rainy day where you buy tickets there is not too much shelter you basically Stand in the Rain or in the sun depending on the day a recommendation if you have children bring a small stroller or some kind of backpack for for babies or mommy pouches that go in the front. The parking closest to the building cost me $40 from 10:30 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. on a Sunday.

For adults it was $37 for the aquarium and the movie there are three movies to choose.
I believe children are the three was free."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3OGRMYnV3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"It is a little small, but a very nice aquarium. The animals and tanks are well kept. They have a lot of demonstrations and educational sessions. I particularly liked watching feeding of the penguins. The training session with the seals was good also. There's a shark exhibit on the map, but it was not fully open when I went. All in all I spent about 2 hours in the aquarium."

The aquariums were lovely with diverse options. There was also a sting ray tank that allowed people to touch the sting rays which was wonderful. The bathrooms are clean and well-kept. There are rental lockers for coats and other accessories for only 5-7 dollars. 10/10 would recommend, especially for families with smaller children!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzMlptZmpBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,Came up to Boston for spring break and visited the aquarium and I was not disappointed! The central tank that opens up at the top is beautiful and allows for a very unique layout of the aquarium. Parking in yr area was expensive but most garages had a discount with the aquarium. We had a great time!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeXUyVkpREAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"The New England Aquarium was a decent experience, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. The tanks and exhibits were well maintained, and although it has a decent selection of sea creatures the crowds can make the experience overwhelming. The exhibits can become congested and it can be difficult to get a good look at the animals. Overall, the Aquarium is a decent option if you're looking for a quick and easy attraction to check out, but there are better options out there for those who are looking for a more memorable afternoon."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJdVBITDhBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"My girlfriend and I had gone to Boston for the weekend and this was what we were actually most excited for. Right away you can see a ton of penguins and learn about how overfishing is affecting marine life. There's seals, sharks, turtles, eels, jellyfish, manta rays, piranhas, tropical fish, shrimp, anenome, beautiful coral, seahorses and so much more. There's a space to touch some of the aquatic life - like starfish - with staff supervision. Perfect for the kids. There's a bundle package you can buy where you can get an imax ticket with your admission to the aquarium. The theater is right next store and offers documentaries about different aquatic life... and Pandas? Hah- at least when I went. Luckily, the popcorn, candy and soft drinks are a lot cheaper than those sold in regular movie theaters. The gift shop is a delight too. They sell clothing, jewelery, toys and other souvenirs. I would definitely go back. I was there for hours and I had a great time."

There are no hands-on exhibits right now due to COVID but was still a great experience. Loved seeing the penguins, jellyfish, and most of all, the octopus! üêô Wish there were more jellyfish tanks though. There are 3 levels as well as a spiral staircase revolving around a center tank. Fun experience for kids and adults! Would recommend finding alternative parking aside from at the aquarium unless you want to lay $35. They offer whale watches and other experiences too. Will be going back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBbl9HeXF3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,Not the best aquarium but good for its size. Lots of penguins and the multi story tank at the centre of the aquarium is quite impressive. Massive sea turtle is a sight to see.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRcFB2NFd3EAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"Perfect place for kids to learn about the ocean, wildlife & conservation. Feels good knowing  $ spent there goes to help animals. First day using my membership - flew right past lines to get in! Plus members get in free all year! Special offers & VIP treatment on select days. Parking is the most expensive item, but members get discounts on that as well. Highly recommend it for nature & ocean lovers, plus the kids are kept in awe!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMkxfdnN3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,Lovely aquarium. I spent only 2hrs here & I believe I saw all the exhibits.Beside the sea lion show it was too cold. I spent about $150 at the gift shop and you had to pay for a bag. I believe at that point it should be free. Beside that the exhibits are worth every penny.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCd3ZTRDNRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"I enjoyed my time here but just didn‚Äôt think this aquarium was worth the money. I was hoping there would be more exhibits and diversity of wildlife. Maybe it‚Äôs different in the summer but I would‚Äôve loved to see a dolphin, sea lion or otter show. We went on a super busy day which also made the experience less enjoyable, it was difficult to even get a good view of some of the exhibits. I think they cap off the amount of people in at a time but I still think there was way too many especially since everyone moves in the same path up the atrium. It was alright for a cloudy afternoon but I‚Äôve definitely been to much nicer aquariums."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZbmNyUXNnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"Went to this aquarium for a morning excursion while visiting family in Boston and was very impressed. It has a 5 floor massive tank that has a ton of fish. We even saw a huge sea turtle that was the size of me! The caretakers were very informative and answered all of our questions. They also have a ton of exhibits that will keep you there for hours. I would suggest getting there early though, by mid to late morning on the weekend, it was packed. A large gift shop too so plenty of options to remember the fun. Check it out."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJX3BQajdRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"Awesome aquarium. My daughter was thrilled and learned plenty in two hours.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2enFLbEZREAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"Wonderful as always, tons to see and friendly staff. I imagine the empty gift shop and the crowds were because of Covid's influence but we went on a Groupon and had a great time. I would say if you're going to go try and do it on a weekday because the weekends are just too busy to really enjoy your time but we had a blast either way and will be coming back. My favorite exhibit was the electric eel, I always love seeing the octopus but I think that they passed away between our previous visits so bear that in mind if you're looking forward to the octopus."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwbHZHczh3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,Splendid aquarium. It‚Äôs an experience for kids and young adults. A spiral glass theme is the central attraction.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRc2NxemFREAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,One of my favorite places to visit when I go to Boston. They have a great deal of sea creatures at this aquarium. The gift shop is priced pretty decently compared to other aquariums or zoos. They have this beautiful tank that holds a turtle the water looks so clear. When you first enter you can see the sting ray and actually touch them. Also it's a few blocks from the market where you can grab food !

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NzhfWjJ3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,Wish it was bigger. No sharks or any larger animals. Just a big circular tank in the middle with penguins at the base and other smaller tanks around the outside. While it was nice and the fish were awesome we found it lack luster. Finished the whole aquarium in like an hour. Was expecting more.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVMGMzRUpREAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"Well worth a visit if you‚Äôre in Boston. The large central tanks has plenty to see in it, as you slowly climb up and around it. There are colonies of penguins at the base to observe and seals outside. Make sure you catch feeding time for the penguins and seals."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMnR6R0JnEAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,Went here and loved the penguins very friendly staff but very crowded go early and plan around staying at most 2hours there simply because it's a small aquarium but it is worth it. Cool jellyfish too
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhaHJyN2dRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"Loved the aquarium.  It very well maintained and there's a fair amount of exhibit to visit. I will suggest making reservations before going because it can get sold out pretty quickly on a nice sunny day.  There's a parking lot just across, if you're spending more than an hour and a half it will cost you $40 ( but that's the maximum, the highest listed fee for 80 minutes to 24 hours.  ) . There are probably cheaper options if you don't mind walking . After visiting you can also walk around the area to visit or relax, might as well enjoy that $40 parking. It was really nice."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRNm83RVFnEAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,I brought my nephew here with my sisters and brothers and he absolutely loved it. I've been here several times throughout my childhood and even as an adult. It never gets boring and there's always something new to discover. I'm obsessed with the inner tank that you get to walk around and up to the center.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBdnRYWEtBEAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"I have visited many other aquariums so if I compare this to others, this one was not so great. They have many varieties but stored in small fish tanks so you don't get the feel of aquariums. Best thing I liked was you can touch the stingrays and few other species. The central tank that holds many varieties and giant Turtle was good"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRMUk3SDNRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"The aquarium was busier than Disney during Christmas and it's August. Maybe people are trying to get out of the rain (still have to stand in the rain for tickets and another line to scan tickets for entry), maybe last outings before going back to school, maybe there was a promotion. Either way, waves and waves of kids. Aquarium was smaller than we thought. One central giant round tube with sea creatures, a wrap around Penguin exhibit that can be seen from all 5 levels. One can see sea creatures getting to the water surface on level 5. A few side displays along the wall on each level and that was it! Spent more time in giftshop thank the Aquarium ü§î."

The penguins were super talkative. Excellent experience. We are going back next weekend üòä
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvdTZ1VnBBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"My first ever visit to an aquarium was anything but disappointing. If you like watching adorable penguins doing their thing, getting up close to large fish, eels and even sharks and if you'd enjoy watching a sea lions play with their handlers, you'll enjoy this spot. I suggest starting at the top via the elevator and then slowly making you way down around the giant tank, taking in the exhibits along the outside edges as you go. And don't forget to go out side to see the sea lions."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaXJUM0NnEAE,A Google Maps review about a aquarium.,"Absolutely beautiful and incredible experience!!! ü§Øüòç I love how it is all handicap accessible, although I am not handicapped, my mother in law has a boot on her foot, so it was a great experience because of the accessibility. The penguin exhibit is absolutely amazing and just wonderful to sit and listen to the noise and when they would fight. I'm someone that is incredibly against any kind of zoo, or SeaWorld type of places but I did read up on this place and found that they do some sanctuary work and conservation as well so I agreed to go here and let me tell you ... When you walk up through the levels ... Such beauty such amazing fantastic views, the fish, the life that lives within this water was absolutely amazing and so very beautiful. Some things, fishes and other aquatic life that I have never seen and I loved it but my daughter just absolutely loved it and wanted a penguin. Also, the larger sea turtle in the giant cylinder aquarium, is 95 years old and when my mother in law was a child, that very same turtle was just a young little baby and than when my husband was a young child, this same turtle was mid aged and so big and beautiful. They have pictures from their times with this same turtle. Just a wonderful place, very informative, sea lions to watch them swim and play around outside as you waited was wonderful. Also, while we waited we got to walk around the giant walkway that surrounds the aquarium and also has the boats for people that want to go whale watching or just a boat ride. There's also the duck tour boats where they go from moving vehicle to a boat. It was fun to see the very old and antique ship too and to take pictures with my family on the ocean. Just beautiful and wonderful experience altogether. The gift shop has some pretty amazing items to buy! And although it can be a bit pricey, for the most part it's actually less pricey than others we've been to on this trip. Overall, a very enjoyable activity to do with family and kids."

The presentation of food was also stunning. I would go there again.
Update: I have seen rude comments from people about the delay in getting food. Iam not surprised since was told they make it from scratch and it definitely tasted super fresh. I would recommend going somewhere else if you have only half an hour for your lunch. This place is more suited for casual/romantic occasions."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5Nm9ISVRBEAE,A Google Maps review about a asian fusion restaurant.,"The flavor of the pad thai wasn‚Äôt bad. I enjoyed eating it but it wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for and the portion was very small, especially for the high price. Also, there was large white onions in it that I had to pick out because the menu didn‚Äôt say there were onions in it. Maybe I was spoiled in Texas with all the good authentic thai food. If anyone knows of a place in the area with authentic Thai food please let me know. By the way, the girl that works there was very friendly."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBaFlHTjhBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"We were driving from Portland home to Canada and it was getting quite late so we found the little town of Shelton and it seemed like a convenient place to stop, being only an hour and a half from the Port Angeles Ferry. We googled a place to stay in Shelton and there was a very limited selection so we pulled into a couple and looked for reviews. Let‚Äôs just say they sounded like rat motels from what we read from other travellers. Once we saw there was a Super 8 in Shelton it seemed like the natural place to say as they are typically a decent place to stay being a franchise and all.

We checked in around 8pm and the front desk person was friendly although seemingly bored with his job. The lobby was clean and nice. We had a truck full of purchases that we didn‚Äôt want to leave outside overnight so it was nice that there was an emergency door close to where we parked for bringing all our stuff in. The front desk person did state that the hotel was located in a decent part of town and our stuff would probably be fine.

We paid $70 for the night which was high considering it was a fairly old hotel. It appeared to have been renovated at one point but the work was amateur at best. There were simple things like repairs to the towel bar which were just never painted over. Little touches like that go unnoticed when done but become BIG eyesores when left not finished. The temperature in the room was hard to keep consistent. I had to keep turning on and off the heat because the room likely is not well insulated. The bath towels were small and the caulking around the tub was gross. There was a mini fridge and coffee area, which was a nice touch. We could hear the voices from the other rooms and the aroma of the Mary J was thick in the hallways. We did not stay for the breakfast unfortunately as we were up and out to head for the ferry.

We didn‚Äôt use any of the amenities, we literally just used this hotel to sleep as a crash pad and it did its job. We felt it was pretty clean and mostly quiet and if we had to stay in Shelton again this would definitely be our first stop.

3 solid stars from Doug and Shannon - It wasn't horrible but it was likely the best option in Shelton."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRbzkzQTB3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,My son had a blast here. He was in awe of all the animals. My father used to take me and now I'm extremely happy to be able to take my son. Can't wait to take him back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzLW9XOWRBEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"It has been a while since the last time we went here, and we love the new look! We bought the Family fun tickets online, with $70++ you got 4 tickets, meals at The Beastro for 4, and a cute souvenir cup. No more printed map, but you could checked their map online. It's good, but I think they should have map on a board on each exhibit or every 3-4 exhibit with where you are on the map. The only map we saw is by the reptile exhibit near... the exit. The others good for the environment move that they did is they don't served straws and cup's lid anymore, so for those with the little ones, you better prepared your own straw. We also didn't see the petting zoo anymore, it's not even on the map."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRNG9QNTN3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,The giraffe feeding was Amazing..all the animals were out and being playful..the train ride was the great way to relax after the zoo. Plenty of fun facts during the ride and a few stops also. Overall really great time from start to finish..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXa3ZuU0F3EAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"San Antonio Zoo has went up in prices and way down in quality. Most the animals are hiding or look uncared for and seriously depressed.

The exhibits are tired and cramped.  Your restrooms are not maintained‚Ä¶.one stall was unused because lack of toilet paper‚Ä¶so I handed out facial tissue to women or girls in line!! Sad.

Your food and beverage prices are not high, they are ridiculously overpriced and do not reflect any bit of quality you‚Äôd expect from the price!

Best of the entire experience? The Boogie kid park. My grandkids loved it!  That earned the 2nd star ‚≠êÔ∏è in this review.

Please‚Ä¶.Overhaul, rebuild, renovate‚Ä¶.but DO BETTER San Antonio ZOO!!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwcVpYYzdBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Absolutely loved it but about 40% of animals didn't show up. I suppose, because of very low temperature outside, wind and a bit of rain. So consider visiting it on warm conditions. Anyway, I enjoyed everything I managed to see=) they have cool kids' playground also!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlM3NXczVnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,This is a great zoo for the family. It's best to go early when they first open during a week day to avoid any crowds. Bring plenty of water to drink as some drink items are pricey in the stores there.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJbnVfcW93RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Wow.  What can be said about this incredible attraction?  Much!  This is one of the best family activities I have seen in a long time.  This zoo is so well done and beautiful that photos can hardly capture it.  The number of things to see is way more than anyone would expect.  There is also a little train ride just outside the Zoo that takes people on a little tour of that local area.  Like many other attractions, things like admission and food are a little spendy. But then think what it takes to maintain such incredible facilities for the massive amount of displays, animals, reptiles, birds & fish and it's totally understandable and appreciated.  This is an attraction that a person can not get tired of and will want to return to!  Thanks for an amazing day!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTeXEyYTV3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,Such a fun experience the lights are wonderful and the Lego statues are very impressive the aquarium amphibian and reptile houses are a must see and its tons of exercise without feeling like exercising.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXcnFtcDFRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"The best zoo in all of the world! Haha I grew up visiting this place as an SA native and it had only improved with time. Animals are happy, healthy, and enriched. Ample shade and seating for tired feet. Lovely signage and visitor engagement. Amazingly fun to find a chupacabra specimen!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNLWZYT1NREAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"The San Antonio Zoo. Not too much differs here from any other zoo, however it is a great place to walk around and take in the scenery regardless. Little kids will enjoy just as much as the adults.

The exhibits are spaced rather close together and allow anyone to see at least 2-3 animals, at one time, within the same 10 meter radius.

During the holidays, however, this place lights up in color and events, I recommend stopping by for the animals, but staying around during the holidays for the fun and festivities.

The zoo food is also good. It is a step above normal. I've been to many zoos and I would have to say this zoo's food ranks at number 4 out of 30. I recommend the burger in the ""BEAST""tro as they call it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURob011LXp3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"It‚Äôs improving so much! I really liked going today, more color, more visual, more activities and so many updates and renovations. Don‚Äôt have many photos because I was really enjoying it.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJMmFHU3VnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"The San Antonio zoo is one of my favorite places ever. It's fairly priced, large, and very interactive. Anyone from children to older adults can enjoy it. There's a lot of places for food and rest and there's a lot of exhibits where you can interact with animals, such as the bird enclosure, feeding giraffes, and others. It's a fantastic place and the animals seem very well cared for and happy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOV9yRFBREAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,Nice zoo to visit. Larger than expected. But almost all the food places were shut down.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBOWFmOGZBEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"I went with my family and had a great time. It's a rather small zoo in comparison to the others I've been to. It also had about half the animal enclosures empty, making it smaller."

We went there on a hot weekend so gotta bring lots of water. They also have souvenir shops.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJeGJUcnZBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"I felt the need to update my review since a LOT has happened for me at this place. This zoo will always have a deep and beloved place in my heart.
I was married here in January 2021 inside the hippo cave! The staff and event coordinator are the most on point professionals I have ever had the pleasure of working with. They had everything I might need anticipated before I could even get it out of my mouth. We were treated so grandly and the food they served was flawless.
They are currently rebuilding endangered species and came out of the pandemic and winter storm without a single animal or staff member lost. If you ever want a place to visit or donate to, please make it them."

Zoo Lights is must do during the holiday season."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdm83R2RnEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Very very expensive!
They charged us $100.00 to get in, $40.00 for a picture and $35.00 for 4 small drinks and 1 Hotdog.
The rides inside the Zoo were extra and so was the Butterfly exhibit.
We saw only a few animals that did not look healthy at all (poor babies)
1 Lion-1 Tiger-1 small Monkey-1 Bear-1 Hippo and a few more here and there.
Not what it used to be.
Very disappointed and will never return."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5X3BlNHJ3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,We had a wonderful time on a perfect day at the zoo. It was our first time and we're looking forward to going back and exploring more. The food could use a bit of work however. Not bad but needs a bump.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvN1B1bFV3EAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Great on a cool day. Go on a cool day if you can. The animals were incredibly lively and it was super walkable. The hippos are definitely my favorite part of this zoo, especially when they're swimming around. I really wish I had taken a picture of the hippos.

5 stars only on days below 75 degrees."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNV9PT21nRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Fun to see all the animals! Definitely wish we would have gone in a cooler month but as long as you go early the heat isn't too bad. You can take pics with some of the animals as well. Didn't try the food but it and drinks seemed pricey just as any amusement is. Overall, fun!"

Ticket pricing is afforable and funday tickets.are.available that probide a ride on the carousel amd the traim amd gets you into the butterfly enclosure.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNta3F1MFBREAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,This was such a fun zoo to visit while we were here from MT. Clean and so much to do. We could've spent even more time there and we spent all day! The kangaroo experience was a highlight!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3c3Z2NTVRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,They have a great selection of animals. Fun for the whole family. Not wheel chair accessible in some parts. Alot of parking spots. Parking lot was dirty though. Dirty diapers laying around. I had a great time with my boyfriend!!! I got a souvenir. We spent 3.5 hours there

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MTllMkl3EAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Thoroughly impressed with this zoo. I haven‚Äôt been in 13 years and it is so much better than before. It was clean, lots of animals and easy to navigate. They are taking COVID precautions seriously. It was a packed house and it still was easy to stroll through and visit all the exhibits."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNODh1NEdREAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,Best $16 we spent this weekend! Much bigger than I thought it would be and very stroller friendly. The enclosures are a good set up for the kids to see through and the staff was helpful. There's lots of opportunities to get pooped on by the overhead exhibits however so be vigilant.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZNHY2SjJ3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"We had a great time at the Zoo. We got the upgraded tickets to ride the train, carousel and feed the lorikeets! Definitely worth it. My kids enjoyed everything and the park is perfect to see everything in a few hours. The lions were the most entertaining. The train ride was longer than I was expecting, but a nice relaxing ride after walking the Zoo."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNbXJYU0ZREAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,Very nice zoo. Lots of animals. The zoo tries very hard to put the animals in their natural environment.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTdHNEWGt3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"I bet if you went in the day it'd be spectacular, but there's no excuses for advertising Lights at The Zoo if the animals aren't even seeable. My local Zoo always has the big lights on display for the animals in events that occur during the night, and the experiences are phenomenal.
Can't say that about this one. Customer service was more like a ""duh"" attitude walking into the property. Didn't want a refund nor tried because I love animals and the money will contribute them."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjdlB1QUVnEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Loved loved it! I only wish all the exhibits and attractions had been open. I understand though due to Carona-virus they can't be. We still enjoyed the Zoo and will go again when back in town! Ordering tickets online was the best way to do it, no lines and quick entry. Staff was super friendly and the park was really clean. It had a variety of animals that looked well cared for. Lots of neat Lego animals that were bigger than the actual animal. Super cool!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhd3R1QjdnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Absolutely loved all of the vegetation incorporated in and around the zoo pathways and exhibits. Some areas were under construction, but will be very cool to see when they are done. The jaguar pathway over the sidewalk will be a must see when it is done.

This is a great zoo for young kids. There is a splash area, a nature area, open lawn, and small amusement park all specifically catered to little ones."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZNktLRDZnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Overall an enjoyable experience. The food was lukewarm and not very flavorful but it was cheap. One of the exhibits had rats running around with the lemurs, eating their food. The baby Komodo dragons were absolutely adorable. They also have kangaroos, which I don't frequently see at other zoos. Our visit was a good value."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwejhMRUtnEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"It's amazing! The exhibits are so open so you get a good feeling of an actual wild life experience. However, I do feel like the Lions den should be larger but at what point is it big enough? It's definitely worth a visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaTYyTUVBEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,Great zoo! The zoo keepers where great talked to my kids and answered all the questions they had about Anteaters plus they have Anteaters my son's favorite!!!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNHNYVG1RRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"They have 2 hippos, what else does one need to see?‚Ä¶.
On a real note, this place was great. It‚Äôs not a large zoo (don‚Äôt even try to compare to San Diego zoo) but it had so much to offer. Hippos, elephants, rhino, lions, reptiles, snakes, birds, and lots more. We bought the fun day passes which included day passes to the park, train tickets, feeding a lory tickets, and the carousel tickets. The train is a miniature version the takes a stroll through the nearby nature park. Feeding the lorys is pretty cool, they give you a cup with nectar and the birds land on your arms, shoulders, head, pretty much everywhere. Then once the nectar runs out they start licking you. The carousel is a carousel with animals you ride, it‚Äôs is made for kids but that didn‚Äôt stop me.

Overall this park was small enough to see just about everything in about 1/2 of a day. It does have inclines and declines but a nice easy hike around the park. The drinks and food is expensive so I would save up if you plan on eating in the park, but I imagine most of that cost goes back into operating the park."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzX056dklREAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Africa Live was really great, amazing variety of animals. Great way to spend the afternoon with the kids but watch out for the bees!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOS1Uc25BRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"A really beautiful Zoo! They have taken advantage of San Antonio's rocky terrain to create some very well landscaped animal enclosures for all of the animals as well as having trees, flowers, cactuses, and ponds laid out throughout the zoo. It was kind of a cold and rainy day the day we went and a lot of the animals were not having any part of it electing to sleep out of the weather in their enclosures, but we still enjoyed it very much! They have a nice reptile house with lots of snakes, lizards, and turtles. They also have a sea life house that has both fresh water and salt water fish and turtles! There are plenty of refreshment stands spaced out around the grounds as well as restrooms and hand wash stations. There are areas under construction and we went in through the Blue entrance, I believe the regular entrance might be the orange entrance, but it was closed. They also have a train station that has a scaled down train to take you on a nice ride around the zoo and Breckenridge Park!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeHZuRDB3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Although a couple major attractions are no longer options there is still much to gain from a trip to The San Antonio Zoo!!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhdGV1N2RnEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,The San Antonio zoo was so much fun I havent been since my children where little and before that when I was a child. My my how things have changed.  We enjoyed the kiddie park my favorite is the Carolsel always has been one or my favorite rides.  I remember the train eveything else seemed so different and new.  We had an amazing time I have been wanting to go I finally made it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbHBTd1NBEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Great fun for the family. Went during the afternoon and waited for the Zoo Lights Christmas display. It was good, but a little crowded which can be tense during this pandemic. Masks are required in any indoor setting, but when outside they are not required.

The Zoo has spent some time clearing out sight lines and making it better for the children which is important to me with a child with serious vision impairment.

The downside was buying a food package in combination with our tickets for hotdogs or burgers and they ran out of burgers when we got to the restaurant and the zoo was still open another 2 hours."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbTYzdGFnEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"This is the most robust collection of cats I've seen at a zoo.  Jaguar, fishing cat, clouded leopard, tiger, lion and more including the Caracal pictured here.

I thought the staff was friendly, the zoo was clean, and the gift shops were well priced.  The zoo is divided up by geographic theme - Australia, Africa etc.  I liked this.  There was lots of information about how native populations viewed particular animals.

The zoo was medium sized, so it's possible to walk its entirety in 2-4 miles."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMnNEWWd3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,We loved the train ride. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our kids loved the ride and never wanted it to end. Its a good 20 minutes ride and the views are beautiful. Definetely worth doing when you are in San Antonio.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3MHZqU09REAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"It‚Äôs been about 10 years since I have visited the zoo and although the admission price is more than I recall, they have definitely made a LOT of improvements. I didn‚Äôt even recognize the place!

The giraffe exhibit is really cool because you can now walk onto a deck that is as tall as the giraffes and you can actually feed them.  Even if you don‚Äôt pay extra to feed them, you are able to walk on the deck and see them face to face ‚Äì it was AWESOME!

The Lory exhibit is also pretty cool.  You walk into this aviary and if you pay a couple of bucks, you can feed the birds ‚Äì they will actually land on your shoulders and arms to eat.  One in our group didn‚Äôt have any food but 3 or 4 of the birds landed on him as soon as he walked in the gate for some reason.

Parking is the same as it always has been ‚Äì kind of tough to park in the lot in Brack Park, but don‚Äôt forget there is parking under the highway on the opposite side of the zoo.

Signage could be improved ‚Äì it‚Äôs hard to find your way to the exit when you are leaving."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2LTdhajl3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Avoid hot summer days -- because the animals are all smart enough to hide under the shades and often not active when it is hot.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURROFpXRGlRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"In the past the Zoo was not the best (see my review from years past) the San Antonio Zoo has put a great effort into making the zoo the best that it can be and is doing a great job in the past few years. I highly recommend this zoo at this time.

I visited many zoos in my past. I grew up in N. E. Ohio and went to the Cleveland Zoo many times every year from birth till 18yrs and then I visited every couple of years, I've visited the Pittsburgh Zoo multiple times in my life, I've visited the Asheboro NC Zoo multiple times, I've visited the Virginia zoo, I've visited the Washington D. C. zoo, I've visited Disney Animal Kingdom and I've been to many super small side of the road places that call themselves zoos or Aligator /Reptile farms. I've seen a lot and have much to compare. The San Antonio Zoo needs some help. The animal habitats for many of the larger animals are not large enough and many of the outdoor habitats are somewhat overgrown and look like the animal couldn't be living in there but they are. The small animals are living pretty well and the zoo is clean and you can tell that it's a fight for the zoo staff to stay up on the upkeep. It's time to update or down size and give a few animals the space and care they deserve. Look to the Virginia Zoo. The Virginia Zoo is about this size but has put a lot of effort into the beauty of the park and great habitats for the small amount of animals that they have. Please do better San Antonio Zoo"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhZ3Z2QzJRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"I loved the pathways and the beautiful flowers... the zoo was nice, it was so hot and humid though. It would be nice if they had places though out the walk to coo down. It was a cool thing to do with family."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbUp5RDBRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"The Zoo is located inside Breckenridge park. It is a great size to explore. It has Komodo dragons, the big cats, a hippo enclosure, a feed the giraffe experience that is an extra fee. Buying tickets in advance makes entry quicker. There are free and reduced entry days that are periodic. We find our season passes well worth having as we drop by whenever we want to get out and enjoy the animals. They are very handicapped friendly and accessible and my daughter with mobility issues navigates the zoo easily. The only help she needs is the stairs into and out of the reptile house. Otherwise it is a great adventure."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJX1pLWlNnEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"This is a nice zoo. It's a bit small and is surprisingly not very stroller friendly. We got there right when they opened on a Sunday. We found an excellent parking space and the zoo wasn't crowded at all. Best part is, all the animals were out! Price was good and they offer a military discount. No map when we came in and I didn't see where you could get one, so we didn't know where we were going or anything. When we walked in we were bombarded with people asking to take our photo (the ones you buy at the gift shop at the end) and we were asked multiple times within the park... it was a little much. The zoo has an AMAZING children's area. Very fun for the kiddos. By the time we left, about 3 hours later, it was starting to get busy, we didn't see many animals on the way out, and the parking was full."

They are constantly doing improvements and adding new animals I learned the night before this most recent visit that they will be adding Gorrillas and a safari! I can't wait for that exhibit. We always bring our family to the zoo boo and zoo lights, which are fantastic! We finally got to ride the train this on this most recent visit which my son loved!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTb3N6WlVREAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"It was our first ride on the train and our two year old loved it! They were super clean and sanitized after each ride, the train has wheelchair access and the staff wore masks and took the proper precautions during this difficult time. The train played Christmas music and was decorated beautifully. It was a nice ride through the park, over bridges and through an unexpected tunnel. We loved it!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnOGYzSEtBEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"We had a good time, well made the best of it.  The poor animals don't look happy,  but it was hot too. Price wise, well what do you expect. Gotta make that chedda, even though they are sponsored. Oh well,  we paid it. That tells them it's ok to over price a stuffed animal that we could get on Amazon. Next time,  Waco zoo instead.
Staff,  ha. Look Miserable and underpaid."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvcGUzNkxREAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Loved it. Of you plan on seeing a lot of exhibits, make sure you get there early enough, because a lot of the indoor areas close at 5, and there's a lot to get through."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycDVEekxnEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Everyone kept saying I might not enjoy it but I had a great time. I don't expect animals to be out all day doing things, I expect to see them when they want to be out. Got to feed the lorikeets and the giraffes, and I went in to pet the kangaroos. Def worth the little extra money, but I wish there were more options for the photo packages."

We arrived @ 9:00 a.m. and it wasn‚Äôt too crowded. As time went on, it was starting to get busier.

The San Antonio Zoo was reasonably priced, a couple of things are under construction. We walked the whole zoo in two hours. Took almost 100 pictures.

Parking is free."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJd3NlVEh3EAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"Ok so I really liked feeding the tortoises! I've never experienced that with a zoo. These are from Alhambra, near Madagascar and they are 450 lbs! Yes, you do have to pay extra for that. They also have camel rides, feeding the giraffes, train rides and a carousel. They are currently completing construction for the rhinos, but I was so excited about the tortoises that I didn't care. It's definitely a must see."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNdWI3VUFnEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,I love the Zoo but I don‚Äôt recommend the Zoo Lights. As you‚Äôd imagine all the animals are attempting to sleep when it gets dark. Their displays are too dark to see anything and of course they‚Äôre not keeping them awake with bright spotlights. It‚Äôs a good thing but most of the displays were completely dark. Couldn‚Äôt see anything at all. Feel like I wasted my money just to see Christmas lights and no animals. Daytime only for sure. Forget the nighttime thing. It would of been a cool date idea tho! But for my son who wanted to see everything it was a negative.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZNUtiQ0JBEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"I took the day off to visit the zoo to check out the rhino exhibit I keep hearing about. I was completely disappointed. The zoo is overrun by vultures in every single corner. Poor animals are sharing their tiny little space with these animals by the dozens and waiting to grab their food. I only took a few pics because I didn't think I'd be writing a review but once I left, 24hours later it still bothered me. I will never return to the San Antonio zoo or any other zoo because when I was little, I didn't know any better as to how confined and stressed these animals look. Many zoo animals experience continuous strange behaviors because they have been kept in captivity for so long or live their entire lives alone. Many parents will continue to bring their families and keep this pattern going. There are animal shelters that provide ample space for wild animals but the zoo captivity isn't one of them. I love my city but I however do not support what I witnessed."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXa29HQUF3EAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"It‚Äôs our fault for going during spring break so it was extremely crowded but even if it wasn‚Äôt crowded it‚Äôs not a very accessible zoo if you bring a stroller or wagon or if you have a wheel chair. It was hard to navigate through especially not knowing some areas are basically only one way. The biggest problem I had was the ticket prices being extremely different than on the website, 21.95 for adult vs 35$ at the zoo and 17$ for kids vs 25$ at zoo, maybe I missed something on the website about the prices being different but that is so much different I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs right at all.  We were extremely disappointed that we spent $120 to have trouble navigating and even seeing the animals and most animals are in very small enclosures. There are more snack stands and lounging areas than there is space to actually see animals and they are kept up nicer than the animal‚Äôs enclosures, seems more like a money making set up than a place to be educated on the amazing animals of the world."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBd1BIR0pREAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"This is a really fabulous zoo, and they are doing great work. Many of the exhibits are gorgeous. Most of the staff we talked to were friendly. The Beastro Cafe was tasty and clean. I'm docking one star only because several of the cat exhibits really did seem much too small for the species and had no noticeable enrichment (though we might have been on an off day)."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJOHZ1OU1nEAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,"I was told it is one of finest Zoos in USA. Well I will debate on that.

Firstly the animal collection is decent but not great. They cover almost all sections of animals like birds, cats, pachyderms, apes etc.,

I believe the areas provided for animals are smaller with respect to their sizes. Apes have the smallest cages I have seen. They have impressive bird collection. They serve food at certain points of the zoo.

Staff are courteous and professional. Visit this place in the early hours where sun is not high point to see some animal activity.

Beware if you are visiting on weekend there gonna be a tussle for parking."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1M2VIMW13RRAB,A Google Maps review about a fine dining restaurant.,"I‚Äôll get right to it, order a bottle of wine when you go to Westchester, most wines by the glass starts at 20.00. My husband had the Wagyu steak and I ordered the salmon my whole dish was too salty, the wagyu was tough, 79.00 tough. Vegetable overcooked. Just because you slap high prices on a menu does not make it affluent or good. The server checked on us 11 times, she was such a sweet and pretty young lady, however,  needs to learn the art of being a server. #dissapointed Oh! The ice cream from Clementines was a delight! For those prices you should offer a Sommelier and better wine selection. The whole production of fine dining is to educate the diner and their experience should make them feel welcomed at your establishment. The hostess was not friendly at all. The decor dark and dreary. Those days of dark and dreary restaurants are outdated."

The decor is beautiful and the ‚Äúvibe‚Äù inside is welcoming and cozy but also hip. I ordered the grilled chicken mezze salad and it was beautiful, but also delicious. The duck fat truffle fries were also phenomenal. We brought our kids (7 and 4) so Chef Matt made them a grilled cheese (he also added delicious crispy fries) and amazing buttered noodles. He even sent our server, Olivia, out to double check that multi grain bread was ok for the grilled cheese. Olivia was a wonderful server as well and knew everything about the menu, and the owner was there at the host stand greeting people as they came in. There was a big table of women having a fun lunch and the bar was full of groups of men hanging out as well. I am born and raised in Chesterfield and it‚Äôs totally unique and awesome for the area.

Their cocktail list is excellent! Their drinks are priced similarly to Ruth Chris's $15+. The use quality fresh ingredients. I enjoyed their French 75.

I ordered the Waygu burger cooked medium rare with truffle fries which are fantastic. They sell it during their happy hour as well. We will be returning! Loved it!"

All I can say is that the food was excellent and while the prices were up there, the quality food and preparation was exactly what you would expect for a premium dining experience and are on par with their prices. Here's a picture of the Sea Bass. Perfectly cooked with an amazing presentation. Skin was crispy with the fish itself, succulent and juicy. Kudos to the Chef.

Service was slow, not just for us but noticeably for everyone around us. Maybe it is because they recently opened but the service didn't seem to have a solid flow.

I want to say the bar needs an additional person but with so few tables two should suffice. It is a shame they dont knock the wall down and expand the kitchen and dining room.

A few labeling mistakes on the menu. Orin swift hasnt made saldo in over a decade but the 2020 orin swift saldo is on the menu."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMHZXUVpREAE,A Google Maps review about a fine dining restaurant.,"Everything from start to finish was fantastic! The onion soup was flavorful and did not need the Gruy√®re cheese, but the cheese made it better. Perfect for a cold winter night! The steak tartare was also flavored well with peppers and the perfect ratio to the sauce. The chips made it even better. The duck breast matched well with the parsnip pur√©e and was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The flavor profile had a gamier edge. The portion sizes were generous, and there were extra duck pieces mixed in with the vegetables. The cocktails were a delight: my old fashioned had a clear, custom cut ice cube that added to the aesthetic charm. The drink tasted better over time as the ice melted.

One of the owners, John, was so friendly; he came to check on our table to see how we were doing. I had a wonderful experience and will definitely come back!"

I felt like the two of them showed that they cared about allowing me to check in early and having my rooms together,  they showed they was willing to work with me for an easy check in. Now, Mary was a different story, her customer service was not inviting. I wanted to see about scheduling pool time and she wanted to give me what she wanted me to have but, I had to stop her to ask what are the times for the pool. Second,  thing happened with checking out. I told her that a charge on one of my room was not mines.  She acted as if I was trying to lie about a charge but, she reluctantly took it off and never said have a good day or safe travels.  She just said next person. The hotel is beautiful on the river side. I was able to see the ships comes in all day. The hotel was cleaned with great housekeeping service. I would definitely stay at this location again.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBLTRiYlBBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Pros:
Service staff other than the front desk was amazing
Food was awesome
Beds were comfortable
Gym setup was spot on

Cons:
Too musky and humid feeling inside the whole building
Vending machines malfunctioning
Front staff was very short with people
Too pricey for accommodations
Pool wasn't worth it
No microwaves in rooms
Elevators were sketchy and not working with ZERO ventilation

I think the bell staff was AMAZING and gave great suggestions for hot spots and restaurants. I felt they went above and beyond.¬† Along with the restaurant staff they had during the breakfast.¬† The gym facility was also a plus as you don't find many hotels that dedicate that much money to health amenities. Not to mention the cooling towels,¬† that was a nice touch! Beds were very comfortable too and clean.

As far as the stay goes I believe it was lacking significantly especially for over¬†$200¬†a night for a room with no view and for what was advertised online.¬† The air quality in the building all together was humid and sticky feeling the whole stay.¬† The elevator air was MISERABLE! The bathrooms in the rooms have no ventilation to move air when showering.

Numerous elevators were broken and unusable on a consistant basis to where I felt the need to take the stairs as a safety precaution not to mention with the fire alarms going off (I understand they might not have the ability to control fire alarms).¬† The mini fridges could only hold a few items and there was no microwave except for one we found 2 floors below us.¬† The vending machines also seemed to be malfunctioning as we had family choose water and it gave them a soda.

The breakfast served was AMAZING! The peach pound cake was out of this world!  Again the staff's hospitality... they were 100% Johnny on the spot. But with such pricey rooms I don't understand why there isn't a complimentary breakfast or to charge a lower amount.

The pool downstairs was also another area that was overly elaborated on the website and in person, was a complete let down...it was murky looking with high chlorination and not much to work with when more people got in (10 people was pushing space).

Upon our departure we called the front desk to have a cart brought up to take out our luggage,¬† we were told it would just be a minute and they would take care of it (this was really the only staff I don't feel weren't so welcoming). After 30 minutes of waiting we looked out into the lobby to see if it was busy because it was around check in time and there were NO lines.¬† My mother went downstairs and spoke to a bellboy about getting a cart and he had no idea someone was waiting for one to be brought up.¬† Again bellboy hospitality was spot on! He even clarified the quickest directions to get us home.

I also want to mention the cleaning staff... although we did not encounter them taking care of our room, everytime I passed someone in the hallway they were smiling and saying hello. This was our first time to Savannah and while being leery in new places I must say we felt like we were welcomed there as though we were family stopping in for a visit.¬† I just wish the hotel amenities were more up to the standards they present online. This was our first time staying in a Hyatt hotel as Hilton has been my #1 go to for years and venturing out has shown why I have been loyal to their hotel...

It's unlikely that I would stay here again, but if I did it would only be due to how awesome their service staff treated usüòä!!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNna2JmdUd3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"My husband and I vacationed in Savannah for July 4th.  We stayed at the Hyatt from June 30 to July 5. From the time we arrived til we left the customer service was excellent. The valets, restaurants servers and the front desk were all great. They also help you purchase tickets for the trolley tours. The hotel is very nice and we had a riverview room and watched the cargo ships pass by and the fireworks on the 4th. They have an elevator that takes you down to River St. The only con was breakfast wasn't included in the price. The buffet was $19.95, but it is very delicious.  Also you pay an extra $30 per day for parking and its not optional. Overall staying here made our vacation so much more awesome. I would definitely stay here again and hopefully soon."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNta3ZTaGhRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"The hotel is definitely at a great location but the service really made us mad. We changed room twice at midnight due to the malfunctioning heater (we had engineers check it but they cannot fix it). The front desk was super cold, never said sorry, didn't want to talk to you. Really no professionalism. Not recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNHNhMkFREAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I've stayed at numerous Hyatt Regencys throughout the world. I've never stayed at such a filthy Hyatt. Far from the one in Bangkok.
Throughout the room you see long-term grime, dried unknown fluids on the floors, doors, doorknobs, cabinets, and counters!!
It's so obvious that nobody has deeply cleaned this room for months if not longer. The room smelled exactly like the damp scent I've experienced while staying on offshore fishing boats.
The soap dish is broken and sharp.
My colleague has empty beer bottles on the top shelf in her closet. Toothpaste on the bathroom walls near the mirror. The mirror is filthy as are the grimy glass shower doors.
There's pink mildew growing all over the shower tiles. The towels are the worst. Super thin and non-absorbent. The pillows are terrible and the mattress is too firm. The blanket was so thin it didn't feel luxurious in any way. Lastly, there was some brown liquid dried on the toilet lid.
Here for a conference and the bathrooms in the hall downstairs were equally dirty."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNjdyN0JREAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Great location.  Inadequate housekeeping for a hotel of that standard and price.  A big pile of hair, yes indeed a pile, had been left in the shower drain.  Made me wonder if they had cleaned the bathroom at all.  Additionally, the main widow was completely smudged as if someone had applied a greasy face onto it.  We mentioned both issues to the front desk and the drain was cleaned up but not the window.  I ended up cleaning the window with a towel.  Another disappointment was the food options... Overpriced 7-inch pizzas for $16 per person, which fortunately tasted good, but $50 for 2 small pizzas and 2 beers... That's ridiculous.
Follow-up from management: received a reply that seemed like a ""cookie cutter"" apology.  I am attaching a picture of the note from housekeeping that was left in our room, I am assuming in hope of tips. My advice: focus on cleaning and skip the ridiculous notes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDbTRpdHJ3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Older facility, but clean and nice. Lobby is reminiscent of a cruise ship with the glass elevators. Had tv issues, but staff tried to fix it. Must have been provider issues. Our suite had a wonderful, big, L-shaped sofa that was super comfy. Wish there was a microwave in the suite, instead of down the hall and around the corner. Another phone would be nice, too. Only phone was in bedroom on far wall. Just a couple of suggestions. Very convenient location for downtown shopping and strolling. Would stay there again!"

Staff were pleasant. Only parking available was valet. The area the hotel is in was very lively. It was fun to walk around and check out.  Getting a good night's sleep was challenging due to the hearing everything from neighboring rooms, the passerbys outside when the bars closed, and the cargo ships going down the waterway."

I totally enjoyed my stay. My room was clean, with a refrigerator, coffee machine, no extra shampoos and conditioners üòèit was a wonderful view of overlooking the river. Nice to see the windows were clean also, to enjoy it. Hotel and customer service was great, to the valet, even though it‚Äôs steep $40 extra a day. üò¨ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I personally would not have stayed there if I was placed in one of the middle rooms, which overlooks the reception/lobby/bar etc. but some people don‚Äôt mind that as It‚Äôs located in a great spot, an easy walk to everything, restaurants, bars and of course historical sites, monuments. I did have dinner and drinks one night at the hotel and they were OK, actually waiter & waitress was excellent. I‚Äôll definitely stay here next time and refer my friends. The one star missing is due to the fact, breakfast was extra, really‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX2RfaGRBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,The bed was firm and the bathroom was dirty. Not worth it. I‚Äôve stayed at motels that were cleaner. The hotel was so loud.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtLXFlaGZ3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"We stayed here for 4 full days (12/18/21-12/21/21 and everything was so clean and beautiful in our room 322! During the evening we had a very nice view of the river and lights! In the morning across the river is not beautiful but not bad either. I actually loved the mornings drinking my coffee and watching the cargo ships come and go and other various boats.  The pool was nice, my son loved it. There was a problem with our refrigerator as it wouldn't stay colder than 40 degrees so we had to throw out our sandwiches.  The hotel comped one breakfast for us each so that was very nice.  Later I figured out that if you put ice in the ice bag and tie it, then place it into a laundry bag and place that inside the refrigerator- plus keep the cabinet door open to let heat escape- it kept the refrigerator at 35. We would put our leftovers ontop of the ice and it worked. Maybe if they take the cabinet door off that should allow the refrigerator sensor to adequately adjust ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. But other than the refrigerator everything else was excellent.  Service, very friendly! I will stay here again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOW95Nzh3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,We lived two nights here. The experience are extremely bad. We got the room at the third floor. Facing the lobby side. There are very noisy in the lobby until 12:00pm in the night. And I fell asleep around 12:30am. Wake up because of the fire alarm around 2:00am in these two nights. Don't live here if you want to have a good sleep.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMkltbC1BRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Spent 3 nights here. It was a decent stay but due to the Covid restrictions we really couldn't take advantage of what the hotel offered. No room service which was disappointing.

Rooms were good sized, beds were comfortable although the pillows left a lot to be desired. Good water pressure in the shower but the bathroom products were a little boring. Good WiFi strength in the room.

The real value in this hotel is the location. It's right in the middle of all the action and walking distance to everything a person would need in Savannah."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNROWRXYWFBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"It's ok. Newly renovated. Not many perks offered aside from being in the heart of the historic (drinking) district of Savannah. Once you valet your car, you are within walking distance of just about everything."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdDhIbnZRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"My son took me on a trip to Savannah for my birthday. I can't begin to even explain how impressed I was with Hyatt Regency Savannah. When you pull up...valet and busboy. Check-in was seamless. The Christmas decor was gorgeous! Not tacky...very tasteful. The gym is the best gym I've seen in a hotel. The indoor heated pool was huge, and very clean. We had it to ourselves for nearly two hours. The room was immaculate! I e worked in the hotel industry...the housekeepers there don't skip any steps. I appreciate that. Within walking distance (some right across the street) were souvenir shops, breweries, pubs, restaurants... everything you need! Our view was a gorgeous clock tower on city hall. Sounds odd...but it was really beautiful. When we go back, we will be staying at Hyatt again. Well worth the price!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDeVAzakxREAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Great Hotel, the only issue is that when you book and you expressly request a ""River view"" they will agree, confirm, and process your payment. Once you arrive, nobody will know anything about the room, the  request, or anything else. The reservation will be there, but no specifics, or notes. And there will be no refund.
Oh and they also don't have breakfast."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5cTZhMXpRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Property is gorgeous! The lobby - Wow factor. On-site restaurant is good and has an outdoor patio with a stunning view of the river. We stayed on the 4th floor because the rooms have a private access to the ""garden terrace"" (also with a stunning view facing the other view of the river). We had an issue on the 1st night of our stay. There was damage to the room (spring break). Manager Chloe went above and beyond to take care of the issue. When in Savannah, we will stay here again for sure!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXcVB5Y0JBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Thin Walls - We paid a decent price for our room on the top floor with Riverview. Not only did we hear the couple from next door enjoying themselves, but we felt the all the ""rocking"" in our bed as their movements transferred to us through the wall. The shared door probably didn't help the noise, but I've never felt bed movements through a wall before.

It was pretty disgusting. I called to request a transfer and was put on hold for ~10 minutes until the call dropped. I called again and was told that every room was taken. They offered for security to come and knock on their door but I declined. All things considered, our neighbors weren't being terribly loud or obnoxious. We just heard (and felt) all the ""commotion"". I don't necessarily blame our neighbors for cheap walls. Plus, a visit from security might encourage more noise/motion as retaliation.

I've stayed in several hotels and never made a google review. Wish I hadn't stayed in this one. I attached a photo to corroborate that I actually stayed on the top floor."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzanBfLWFBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"We attended an event the Savannah Ballroom Classic at the Hyatt. Even though the facility was renovated a few years ago, it is incredibly well maintained. Light, bright and spacious in the Commons areas; grab-n-go was well stocked with healthy snacks, mini-meals and the standard convenience foods. Surprisingly, there was a thoughtful emphasis on Savannah foodie specialties and GeorgiaGrown treats, condiments and drygoods. The ballroom set up was tastefully prepared and catering staff were on top of the meals that were part of the competition specialty package. The entrees served were creative and beautifully presented. The restrooms were clean and well stocked. Every interaction with hospitality staff was terrific, a vast improvement on years past.  Although we did not stay overnight, our experience as a day guest was terrific. I would have rated the review a five-star, however the internet, even as a guest, was slow and glitchy; same as last year."

The check-in was friendly and fast!
The lobby and general common areas were PRISTINE!
On to the room...AMAZING! The room was so clean and the view is to die for!! Its right on the river and I had two walls of windows! (1 of the river and 1 of River st.)
The bar...A+ !! I forgot the bartenders name but she was great! We went and sought her out for night two as well.
The entire hotel is relaxing. You now have to reserve The indoor pool so that only 1 group or family is in there at a time. You get 1hr. which was fine with me.
I will definitely be back!"

On our second night of our stay I pulled back the sheets to discover a dip / spit stain. And by staying I don't even really mean stain I just mean a nasty marking that could have most likely been laundered away .on the mattress pad that was not from me or my husband so it had been there when we started our stay. I had unfortunately noticed that the room wasn't very clean upon checking in and just chalked it up to bad housekeeping but this was beyond acceptable."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBcXFEUFdBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Stayed here for the 4th of July week. Not a bad drive from here to Tybee island, about 30 minutes one way. Everyone seemed to enjoy their job or acted well. You can always tell the one or two ppl who don't want to be at work, but they still were helpful. The gym and pool are below the lobby are seem nice. Plenty of workout equipment and never crowded. Too many restaurants to choose from and the food was awesome! My wife and I did the breakfast at the hotel every morning with our daughter for the convenience. It cost around 20ish per person. There's a horse carriage ride pick up right outside the front entrance. So everything seemed really close to this hotel and if you stay on July fourth book a hotel room facing the westin hotel. We had a perfect view of the fireworks with perfect 72 degree ac weather. All in all a great experience and we will definitely be back next year!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOHFMQlRBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"So disappointed with my stay here and very disappointed with how our issues were handled. Came here with friends and booked 2 rooms next to each other. Both our rooms were filthy. Mine had a few dead roaches by the bed/tv, some random dirty boxers, and a giant layer of dirt all through the carpet. When we complained they did not take any action for a whole day. They offered us either a cleaning or two (much worse) rooms that weren't even together. The manager didn't even reach out to me until after we checked out. Given the price point, absolutely NOT worth the stay. 24 hr gym is nice though"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydDYzbzBBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I've stayed in a motel 6 that was better than this place. The hotel was nice, but the room was not worth $500 a night. Then $38 for ""valet parking,"" but I had to go to the garage to pick my car up. I could have just parked in a public lot for all of that. The AC didn't work well. I turned it all the way down just to get the room to a comfortable temp. There was a chicken ball under the bed, as well as a random pill. Lastly, they put me in the handicap room where the door automatically stays open for about 1 min. Giving the hallway a full view of my room. This is the worst hyatt I have even seen. I'm truly disappointed in this!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRX1ludzNRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"So I love Hyatts and are even Hyatt members (but am not necessarily brand loyalist) and thought how can we go wrong with staying here especially with the location. Well other than the location, I have to say for a Hyatt we were disappointed. To begin with we upgraded our room to get a water view with a bacolony. Being a member and having the app it allows you to upgrade the day or two before your reservation. Well, our room was ready early but it wasn't the right room we paid extra for. üòí it was a water view from the side of the building (oh I see what they did there that's sneaky) but where is my damn balcony. To make matters worse every time I went down to deal with it at the front desk there was a huge line and only 1-2 people working the front desk ... Which seems a little short staffed considering its such a huge hotel on the weekends. I would always just give up and resolve to come back later. A couple times I tried calling on the phone and no one would even answer the phone just pick up the phone and hang it up. üò°. The major problem we had was the Valet service. SLOW, SLOW, SLOW. Again, because they are often parking your cars off site (we were told this by the actual staff) they DON'T have ENOUGH PEOPLE WORKING. I had read the reviews and peioke griping about the valet so I told me husband hey call about 20-30 min before we need our car. We would get the phone call to our room ""please proceed down to valet your car will be ready in 5 min"" and THEN STILL WAIT ANOTHER 15-20 MIN. This is ABSOLUTELY unacceptable especially when they are charging you $30/night and MANY other hotels in the city that are just as expensive are free or not nearly the cost. I dont mind paying, don't get me wrong I actually love the convenience of valet.... But DAMN you better get that service locked down because it is making your hotel look like ammature hour! Just because the inside is nice and reflects a Hyatt chain doesn't mean you can SKIMP on customer service because the word will get out and the Hyatt Brand will come calling. End of rant."

The bedrooms are clean, but the staff won't have most of the rooms done until late afternoon.

Signs are posted saying quiet hours are 10 pm to 7 am. The noise in the center area carries to the rooms and it was loud every night until around 1:30 am.

Watching the cargo ships go past while fully loaded is a neat thing as well as the rest of the boats doing their thing. This hotel is also right in the middle of everything happening on River Street.

The room had a balcony, but a super tiny one, just to stand and take in the scenes. You can see the boardwalk below and endless flow of river traffic as well as the bridge. The room was spacious and clean. I gave four stars for the price. I feel it was overpriced in relation to the view and type of room.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvdjlINHVRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"On arrival Jan.25, 2019 valet was a lil hectic around 5pm but check in went smoothly. Valet is $30.00 per day I think rather you move your vehicle or not.. We arrived and let a family member picked us up each day. So our truck just stayed parked.

We had  booked 2 king size riverview rooms. $424.46 each for 2 nights. You can see the Queen Mary right outside of our window. The room was nice and spacious. The bed was so comfortable. The elevator came quickly. There's a restaurant on site. The hotel is just absolutely beautiful.

You can hear the barge when it comes by early in the am it blows a loud horn.

You can exit the building and go right onto River Street. We went for a night scroll with everyone else out and enjoyed the night life. Thanks Hyatt"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5Z0kzMzhBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Beautiful hotel. Really clean. The staff is incredibly accommodating and helpful. What I loved most was the lobby area, and the lounge spaces that overlook the river. Although our room also overlooked the river, my husband and I just sat and talked there for at least an hour. Valet is swift, but the location is in walking distance to almost everything. We had one very small hiccup which I wouldn‚Äôt even mention here, but I only do so to tell you how amazing and caring management was to rectify it IMMEDIATELY. This establishment prioritizes their visitors‚Äô experience from beginning to end. I will definitely stay here again."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpd2ZyUnhnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Absolutely wonderful hotel.

We stayed here for a drive from FL to Atlanta, and wanted a change of scenery instead of going up I75 again.

It's in an perfect location, on site valet parking is a bit pricey, but the Whitaker Street garage is a very short walk to the hotel and much cheaper to park at.

Walking along the river is quite nice too. Watching the ships is quite cool.

The sun deck on the 7th floor give a nice view of downtown Savannah, and the Garden Terrace on the 4th floor has a great view of the river with comfortable and quiet seating.

When we arrived we saw many signs for the Georgia Association of Realtors, so we were a little worried it'd be noisy, but it is dead silent in the room.

This is by far the quietest hotel room I've ever been in. In the hallway is quite a bit noisier, but in your room it's literally silent.

Even with someone above you, you can't hear them take a shower unless you are in the bathroom deliberately trying to hear it. It's fantasticly quiet.

The bathroom is fairly small, I will agree with those reviews, but it's not unreasonable at all.

In my opinion the only thing that gives away how old this hotel is are the elevators. They look so incredibly dated it's hilarious. The boxy glass elevators are in desperate need of modernization. One of the 3 are out of service for updates, but who knows when that will be done. There's enough reviews on here saying it's been in progress for a while. Only having two elevators was not a hindrance at all though.

The bar was pretty nice too, and the outdoor seating area has a great view of the river. I'd totally recommend the River Street Rendezvous cocktail. It's excellent if you like rum and pineapple juice.

Overall, I'd definitely stay here again. Hyatt continues to deliver on their legendary quality."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURndUlhOUNBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"We go here once a year and were so disappointed. We have never had a problem  checking in a little  early, but this time they said room wasn't ready. No problem. Walked by the river  & came back at 4 (check in time). Still not ready. Offered to comp us an appetizer or cocktail. Got one cocktail each and waited for them to contact us. 5:40 We were able to check in. We met the couple next door on the balcony and they had same problem. Just a shame because we loved coming here until  this."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjcFpLUERBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Great location right on the river.
We enjoyed the view from the public sitting room.
They offered us a free pack and play for our small travel companion and it came with some travel size goodies which I thought was a nice gesture (even though baby powder is a no go).
The room was modern, clean, and good overall.
The gym was great and the pool was good for a little swim (it‚Äôs on the smaller side).
Staff at check in was friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDMXBmdmNBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"If you're looking for a nice, clean, upscale hotel, located centrally to all attractions, this is your place.

The front desk is exemplary. Far exceeds your ideas for the best customer service, and truly takes care of you.

Their marketplace was also top notch. They have a variety of quality goods, from banana bread, bagels, candies, gourmet sandwiches with chips, variety of beverages/sodas, fresh hot coffee, and an entire freezer full of Savannah's best ice cream, Leopold's! (Sandwich kit is a lil pricey at $15, but it was good).

Also, when the Hyatt's computers went down, they were still able to handle and help customers. Really impressed with the level of care and the helpfulness. The valet was also pretty good. They lost my keys initially, but it was due to the system being down, and in a downpour, the valet ran my car to us. I would recommend this hotel over any other in the downtown area."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdTlxOE13EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"The hotel was in a great location on the river. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Housekeeping could have been better, the curtains were stained, the carpet could have been vacuumed better and the bathroom was very dusty."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURleXZlbnRnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"We utilized this property for a work retreat, and over 4 days we saw the staff in action. Housekeeping was excellent, with the only less than excellent item being that they didn't vacuum my room each day. Front desk staff at reception was attentive. Lobby was spacious and beautifully decorated.

We also used a meeting room that was staffed by food service workers and hotel management, and this was an interesting situation because the first day we were there they took excellent care of us.  The second and third days of meetings, our service was noticeably dropping off. Staff on the first day were well aware of our dietary restrictions in the group and were very detailed to make sure everything was correct. Not so in following days. The last day they basically disappeared after lunch, zero dessert options or drink refills, and we did not see hotel staff again until the end of the day. However, food was good and our drink station was properly maintained most of the time. Views from the meeting room were beautiful, overlooking the river.
Overall this was a good experience and I would stay at another Hyatt for business travel."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNjRMbXpnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"The view to the city is really nice. The hotel is really beautiful inside. I loved the decoration. The gym is really good equipped and the pool is old but still nice. My main issue is the cleaning I was trying to dry my hair with the hair dryer and it's the most disgusting thing that I had ever seen in my life. I'm adding a picture I'm marking in a circle the scratch to the dirt that I did with my nail just to see the amount of ( i don't want to know what is it ).
I'm on room 652 if someone from the hotel wants to take a look to it."

The A/C didn't work in our room.  Then the bed were hard as a rock. I requested chocolate covered strawberries and they were sour. The font desk gave us 2 box fans to try, then a new room and a refund for the strawberries. But it just shouldn't have been that difficult. üòï"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMUs2VG13RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"This was our first weekend away from our 5 children in over 2 years and the Eden Resort and Suites did not disappoint. From the welcoming atmosphere, cleanliness, and phenomenal staff we will definitely make this our first choice for another staycation. The staff was accommodating and courteous.  While walking down the hall to my brother and sister-in-law's room carrying her birthday gifts a staff member in front of us turned around and asked if we needed assistance carrying anything.  The room was spacious and comfortable and we loved the adults-only floor. We all actually decided to not go out and do an activity but stayed in the room and had beverages and played cards till after 2 AM. A big plus is where our room was and the ""J"" entrance we were a mere 100 steps to the Sheetz :) The only complaint we have is with the pool. We have no problem and understand the booking of time slots to ensure everyone's safety I wish it was open later for adults. Most places we have visited only allow adults after 10 PM.  It was kind of hard to enjoy the hot tub. Otherwise, I really have no complaints at all. We easily made reservations for Arther's Terrace and the food was delicious."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvNk1XVklnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,This hotel was beautiful. We stayed here for a work function and the staff were all very pleasant. The villa was very nice and spacious although we were on the bottom level and I could very easily hear the floor upstairs everytime someone moved around. It did wake me up in the morning. There seems to be a lot of activities for the warmer months and I believe it would be a great place to stay with children.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2dWItTDRRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Overall, we had a good stay. Came here with my sisters, mother, and nieces for a girls night out. The room was clean and comfortable but a bit dated. Staff were friendly and helpful during our stay.

The pool was heated, but it was still cold in my opinion. They ran out of towels when I had arrived to the pool so I had to wait until I was ready to leave and they had just restocked the towels. The playground was small, but nice. The basketball court was also nice. The table tennis could have been maintained better, the net was broken so was the 1 paddle that was at the table. While I was there the restaurant was closed for renovations. So were unable to get room service despite the front desk telling me the other restaurant was opened, but I was unable to get connected to that restaurant.

Other than the few minor hiccups, we enjoyed our stay, I do feel the resort was overpriced based on what was offered."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbmRYdnVnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,We went to the Eden for a banquet.  The courtyard and lobby were decorated beautifully and very festive for the holiday season.  The only complaint that I would have is that the line for the bar was very long and the people that wanted drinks were taken away from the event for about 20 minutes at a time. All in all it was an excellent night!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbWRQT2lRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I can't even guess how many times I've been to the Eden for events, numerous.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eXA2ZkdnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"We stayed for an overnight stay this past weekend and had a wonderful time! We were in a poolside room which had a door right into the indoor pool. This was so nice to be able to walk right out, swim, and head right back into our room. The room was clean and comfortable and had plenty of space. The outdoor pool is a good size and has plenty of seating available. We used the mobile app for check-in, check-out, and the key to our room which worked great and it was so nice to not have to go to the front desk for anything.

We explored the hotel and the event rooms were so beautiful. The location isn't directly near much, but it is pretty close to downtown Lancaster which had some great restaurants and shopping.

The main issue I think worth noting is that the wifi in the hotel, at least in our room, was basically unusable. We had to use mobile data to use the internet and the app for our room key. If you need internet to do any work while you're there I would say it isn't going to happen. Overall our stay was great and we'll definitely consider going back!"

The housekeeping, staff, front desk went far and beyond what we expected (Jacob was awesome!) We literally live not even 30 mins away and decided to stay at Eden for 2 days as a ""Staycation"" for our family of 5, so great we extended an extra day and I must say, we enjoyed every min, from the huge indoor heated pool to the playground and even mommy got to enjoy some time in the jacuzzi!:) Plenty of dining nearby if you choose not to use the delicious food at Arthur's, Bloody Mary's are outstanding! Needless to say, husband has vacation again in June, we are definitely looking forward to spending 5 fabulous days here again. Thank you Eden and staff for a wonderful few days away!:)"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCX2V5YXR3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"We came to Lancaster to enjoy the New Year. We stayed in the King Villas. The room itself was beautiful. The bathroom could have used some updating. Also the  kitchenware needed better cleaning, but nice nonetheless. The real issue with my stay and why I would never decide to visit again was the customer service and my personal property. I stayed overnight on New Year‚Äôs Eve. I woke up in the morning to find my white car parked in the lot COVERED with confetti. My car was the only one within that lot covered. I was understandably upset, and wanted to rectify the situation. I called the front desk and explained the issue. I understand it was not the hotel, but rather other guests and my personal property is not the responsibility of the resort. Where is the accountability for the guests they house? They offered minimal help or care. The most they could offer to assist was windex and paper towels or filing a police report. They had no usable hose on the property where I could have rinsed off my car. They offered no kind of compensation towards a car wash, even $5.00 would have gone a long way. The confetti had to later be POWER-WASHED from my car. Again, I understand it wasn‚Äôt the resort directly , but I would not trust my car on this property again, personally."

We had made mention of this to staff when booking and asked for a ballon in the room as something special. Staff went above and beyond by including some snacks for her as well as a card in addition to the ballon. Needless to say our 4 yr old freaked out when she saw it. Thank you so much to the staff that made our night special for our girl! We got a poolside room and so we were able to make the most of our time swimming. Our room was spacious and clean. We look forward to staying here again.

Heated outdoor pool open until end of October. Also outside has small playground, basketball, pool table, ping pong table, shuffle board & bocce. Reasons for 3 stars, 1. had absolutely no WiFi the entire 4 days their in our room. It was located poolside by the indoor pool. WiFi worked outside of room & in lobby though. Spoke to front desk twice, & they said they didn‚Äôt need to come to the b/c router was outside of room. Was texting with someone & they gave me the password to another WiFi, but that didn‚Äôt work in the room. 2. Weddings all weekend so very hard to get a parking spot at night. Rooms lack USB ports to charge devices. No more free coffee in lobby. Gave a card now for towels, 1 towel per card, if you don‚Äôt turn card back in $25 charge, see pic. Hotel is $200 -$300 or more a night depending on when you go. 10-15 minute drive to Route 30, where all the stores & activities are."

We checked into on of the suites snd recived a text from. The concierges to help us with anything we needed. We texted them a few times to get some information and they were very prompt, helpful and really nice. The room is wonderful, very clean  and modern. See pics. Were going to us the heated pool , hot tub and will try the on site restaurant, will update our review post.
Update, we did goto the indoor pool and it was enchanting. Indoor heated pool was great. You get cards for towel service when you check in and get a fresh towel when you arrive to the pool. The jacuzzi was corded off due to maintenance. While that was dissapointing for our evening I greatly appreciated thier concern for guests safety.
We also had dinner at the restaurant and that was incredible. They have this seafood dish with a tomato broth that was divine. Everyone in our party raved about thier food.
Breakfast, we would advise to skip the buffet, it was not up to the rest of the standards. Pastries were days old, the hot fares were mediocre.  The fruit was nice but that was not worth the price. So I would suggest breakfast offsite and there close places to choose from.
Breakfast aside this place us great and we'll worth the price, we loved our stay."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2LTZHMFFBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Had a group stay here. Very comfortable and clean rooms. Used the laundry facilities here and they were reasonably priced at $1.50 per washer & $1.50 for 45 minutes of dryer ( add 25 cents for 15 minutes extra time on dryer)

Bathroom was clean. This hotel gives extra supplies as well such as 2 qtips, a nail filer etc etc.

Room was spacious, clean and had its own printer for business folks

Bed was so comfortable and soft to the touch.

Overall, a great experience with this hotel"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdmF1Z2JREAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"We stayed here over the Thanksgiving weekend to visit family.  We had a room right off the pool so our grandchildren could come visit and spend time swimming. It has a tropical atmosphere and a hot tub. The door to the pool is locked from the outside at night and there is an alarm that alerts you if someone opens the door from the room. This is great for safety for families with small children. The room we had was spacious with 2 queen beds. The room was clean.  I liked the vanity make up area outside the bathroom but the lighting should be more conducive to being able to see better. This hotel has a bar off the dining room and the dining room had certain hours of operation...which is ok as I like the option to eat in the dining room instead of going out.There was a convenience store which carried lots of goodies including great coffee from Lancaster County. I really like the classic charm throughout this whole resort and the  service of the staff was
superior throughout.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is the comfort of the bed. We woke up each morning with backaches. Maybe mattresses should be upgraded ü§î. Otherwise a classic hotel which I enjoyed."

It was saddening. The fried fish was thin and dry almost overly fried or fried and sat out. Ordered lobster dip and received 3 table spoons of it. The chips were burnt and I had to toss. I expected more for the price and the descriptions online. However I was disappointed, as this was consistent for most of my staff with their orders.

Our Grown Children & their Spouses & Our 4 Grandkids really ENJOYED what they ordered & even sampled other Family Members dishes. Our Server was a VERY NICE & HELPFUL Gentleman by the Name of DONALD. He took a few minutes to show us the MENU & He even made a suggestion or two in case We couldn't decide what We wanted. The Menu choices were MASSIVE & looked very TASTY in the pictures, Which made My choice on what to choose to EAT more EXHAUSTING. My Wife's & My 1st Visit to ""RED LOBSTER"" Won't be Our last bc We were BOTH very IMPRESSED w/ Our Server DONALD & Our LUNCH was so ""DAMNED DELICIOUS"" & the INSIDE DECOR was Very Impressive & Warm.

I personally wanted one of the lobster dinners they were advertising so I ordered it after the event was over.
It looked like the lobsters were old, sat out all day then microwaved. A $50/$60 tasteless plate. I sent it back and kept the free meal. That free meal was also tasteless. No seasoning on Anything.
That was an event offered there for several days.
That salesman had to have spent thousands!
My suggestion to him, find another restaurant if he ever came back to Pittsburgh. The best thing offered at Red Lobster that day was the bed because I bought one!!
This is what I got versus what they advertised"

My only complaint is that the fried green beans didn‚Äôt seem like they were cooked enough before being fried, otherwise the food was delicious. The biscuits live up to their reputation of course, my burger was cooked perfectly medium well just like I asked, the Sunset Passion Colada was amazing (half peach, half strawberry syrup), and the brownie sunday was so good I could cry. 10/10 will come back.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCM2UyTDJRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"This place doesn‚Äôt look like much when you pull up, but once inside you can tell that they take pride in this hotel.
Everything in the lobby was very clean, neat and orderly. It looked like this place had been remodeled recently.
The breakfast and sitting area are located right off of the main entrance across from the lobby.
It too was very clean and neat.
I stopped here for one night on my return trip home from Florida.
I always choose a Best Western because the rooms are very clean, they give you complimentary toiletries, blow dryer, iron and ironing board, a coffee pot and free coffee in your room. You also get a refrigerator and microwave in your room and free WiFi.
I always try to get a king size bedroom. The beds are super comfortable, and I‚Äôm able to get a good nights sleep.
With my room came with a complimentary breakfast. This is standard with most Best Westerns.
This Smithville Best Western has an indoor pool which is permanently closed and a gym. I did not use them.
For breakfast they serve scrambled eggs, ham or bacon, grits, homemade waffles, that you make yourself. Cold cereal, oatmeal, fresh fruit, yogurt, biscuits and sausage gravy, bagels, toast, muffins, pastries, coffee, tea, juices, or milk. You can have as much as you want. The breakfast is constantly replenished by a sweet older lady.
Checkin was very easy. The front desk staff was extremely nice, and made some recommendations when we asked. They have a free parking lot.
This hotel is located off I-95, this low-key hotel is an 8-minute walk from shopping at Carolina Premium Outlets and 2 miles from the Ava Gardner Museum. The prices were reasonable for this hotel.
I would definitely stay here again."

There's a lot of monetary variation in the slots too so if you're looking to play penny machines or dollar machines they have it all. If you're into table games they have plenty of those too. There's so much to do and see it can't be done in one visit.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM1BybmRREAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,At our TNV financial freedom weekend with Darnell and Tracy Self of Ppls Legal shield business. Team retreat
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1azQyNmNREAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,Had a wonderful time.  The casino has changed somewhat ad fat as the restaurants are concerned.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3XzhIMnB3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"We had a great time.  The front desk team experience was wonderful.  We were first time guest, and the desk team made sure we knew about the features of the hotel.  We felt like high rollers on a low roller budget.  The room was very nice.  The room has a tablet for you to use.  It displays your name, and you can track the daily room bill and any other charges.  The walk-in shower was a nice touch.  The casino was - a place to eat your money.  But we enjoyed ourselves.  We ate at David's restaurant once for dinner, and twice for breakfast.  What we did for the second breakfast was order one meal and split it.  And we still could not clean our plate."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNHRHTDdnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,This hotel was nice. Came to this casino as a bus trip. I was only in the casino while walking to go to the mall (Arundel Mall) but from what I could see and hear it was ‚ÄúLive‚Äù (lol) and vibrant. Ppl seemed to seriously be getting their gamble on. The hotel was decent and clean.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPd05Qdzh3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,I only got to swe the casino. The way they had the lobby designed was so refreshing and beautiful. It was something we simply loved. It looked like some type of oriental or Asian design.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dE5hVnd3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,Very disappointed that i was attend festival event on July 16th they told us to leave immediately without telling any reason during the live session. Very disrespectful to the community. You should tell us why the show over while still happening...

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXd0xTNkN3EAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"For as much money as I paid, and how high scale they make the hotel look/seem, im very disappointed and will not be booking here again. Upon walking in and inspecting my room, there were crumbs and dirt everywhere. Nice to know they dont sweep or vacuum in between guests. I stayed two nights, and found myself having to go to the restaurants in the casino for more to drink than the two complimentary mini bottles of water they give you, and one bottle of ginger ale was 5 dollars. I guess i should‚Äôve expected nothing less, but the food and restaurants all seemed the same. The food they offer at luckies you can find at orchid kitchen which is also the envivo restaurant in one. I expected since the restaurants are listed as separate entities that they would be separate but its not. I was looking forward to staying here but I am extremely disappointed. Imagine cutting into a beautiful extravagant looking cake just to find out its made out of rice krispie treats. That‚Äôs exactly what staying here was like, i‚Äôve stayed at cleaner hotels that were cheaper than this. Even the complimentary toiletries were dirty looking. I can never get the time and money i spent here back, and for that I say save yourself the disappointment and skip staying here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHNUxpcXVBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Absolutely beautiful rooms! Great place for a convention or conference. Conveniently located next to a mall and shopping. Plenty of restaurants are available within the hotel and within walking distance. The casino and bar are so fun. Hotel staff is friendly. They gave us a casino credit when they couldn't get our rooms ready on time. I also left a personal item and the staff was very helpful in being able to retrieve it after I had checked out. Overall, a great experience!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvcXZTMGNBEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"This review is about the hotel itself. Big pluses it's location (less than 40 minutes drive from DC) and direct connection to the casino and just 3 minutes walk to the center of the shopping mall. The room decor is pretty nice, they are clean and have ample of amenities (supplemental coffee, towels and so on). The staff is attentive (some reviews mentioned that staff were rude - nothing like that here). Check in and check out was a breeze. So, why 4 stars? I get used to having minibar - here a fridge but no drinks. Also a little bit late check in time - past 3PM. Overall it was a darn good time. And finally couple technical details - hotel charges around $15 resort fee (worth it - the spa is nice) and it's $150 hold for accidental fee (some people counted it as ""erroneous charge""."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaDdfV05REAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,I love casinos anyways but this one is big . It had a lot of new games that I tried . Some I liked some I didn't.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURraGRHSHFRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Took my husband to the on-site restaurant PRIME RIB for father's day. What an amazing experience. The lamb chops were very tasty. My server Micheal was nearly perfect. Very attentive , made excellent recommendations and made an excellent photographer. Valet parking staff were very friendly and helpful. We ended the night by checking out the Cigar Lounge Orchid where we indulged in a few different cigars , recommended by the bartender Tina. Overall an amazing night. I will be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjdEliZnlRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,There is no one really at the casino due to the covid crisis.  I'm not sure it's even open.  They put a heart with an exclamation mark in the windows every night.  I gave it a 5 star rating.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhMlAtRUJBEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,The FanDuel Sportsbook inside the Maryland Live Casino is a great place to watch any sporting event. The bartenders are top notch and the waitresses are the best at customer service. I will be watching the Ravens there all season.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURraDQzSWVBEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"I was there the First day they opened in chaos. It was exciting and I wanted to see Bobby Flay üòò. It has changed so much now , with table games üé≤üé∞ and more restaurants. The expansion
of the Hotel just gave it more reasons for new business experiences. They also have great concerts at the Casino üéº. Being at the retail center is a plus for everyone, Arundel Mills is a full day or 2 adventure."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwOGJMMV9RRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"We were visiting from out of town and we wanted to try out a new restaurant and check out a casino for the first time so we went here (we also ended up checking out Horseshoe Casino on another night and I would prefer Live! over Horseshoe if I gambled since it was more crowded and more tables going on at Live!). The main reason we visited was I have seen Bobby Flay on the cooking channel so wanted to try out his burger palace.
We did not gamble but we walked around the casino before and after dinner at BBP. This casino is also a hotel. A 4-star hotel. It is located in Hanover which really worked out for us since it is right next to the largest mall in Maryland - Arundel Mills. Quick walk from the mall to the casino.
We saw hundreds of slot machines and some table games going on like blackjack, poker, roulette, craps, etc. and playing the slots and table games range from 1 cent to a couple hundred dollars as far as what you can bet per slot or table. They did have a high betting area as well. I think it was at least $50 each bet but not 100% sure; we did not walk in there. In the main casino area, I saw video themed slots from dragons, anime, Simpsons, etc. Musicians and bands come here to perform such as Gladys Knight and Dwight Yoakam so check it out if you are in the area and want to go to a special event.
The bathrooms in the casino were clean. Everything was stocked with toilet paper, soap, paper towels, etc.
There are other restaurants/places to eat at that have American, Asian, seafood, and Italian dishes. There are a lot of casual places and a fine dining option. Go to the casino website to check out those options. There are TVs in this casino to watch sports on such as Sportscenter, baseball games, football games, etc. They had a Live! Casino gift shop as well. We didn't walk in there but it was big enough to get a souvenir with their logo on it, cigarettes, snacks, or whatever you wanted from there.
There was plenty of free parking. They also offer valet parking.
It was cool to go to a casino and have that experience but I am not sure we will be back again unless we were with a group of people who wanted to go or we chose to try out one of the other restaurants."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJeGV6eUhREAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,I must say I was blown away great hotel and casino
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2MXAta2tBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,No visible security in the parking garage. Plenty of security and staff throughout the entire casino floor. New slot machines. Plenty of spacious area for the true sports fan on the main floor near the poker tables . They included a FanDuel section near the Live! REWARDS desk. That's brand new. Majority of customers are wearing masks  and all Employees are wearing masks.  Maryland LIVE! Management SHOULD enforce mask requirements REGARDLESS of vaccine status.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtemZmREtREAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Yeso in the age of mandates, this casino upped its game and allows customers to enjoy themselves without putting any unnecessary restrictions on the fun.
As a player you can take it just about as far as you want to go  or realistically, as much as your budget or wallet would allow. The tables, slots and games are player-friendly, and on a good day - if you're lucky - payout $$$ The bars and restaurants are close by convenient and serve up high quality belly filling food at a reasonable price. Considering the surroundings, there's plenty of things to do to keep even the most selective gambler occupied. A fun time, solo or with date. Roll the dice and give it a try."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNDhpYTNnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,I went into the casino in a winning mode. Sitting at the first slot I put 13$ in the machine and got 496$. WoW!!! lady luck
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOV9MRldREAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"The appearance of this hotel is great but I hope you don‚Äôt have to call the front desk. You have to call for any towels, to have your room clean, etc‚Ä¶.. the wait times to call are greater than 5 minutes. The room with the lights and suites above was very good for the conference, thermostat just right, screens beside the stage large but speakers hang in front of them. Conference food was absolutely lacking any taste or creativity. Vegetarian option was pasta with a can of warmed tomato sauce dumped on top.
Hotel staff was very nice. The bathrooms were staffed with people for the conference area and were kept exceptionally clean‚Ä¶ I mean SPOTLESS! Overall, it‚Äôs an OK hotel but needed more staff. We were there for 6 days and wasn‚Äôt able to get a cart for the luggage when we arrived or left.
The location of the hotel seems good considering the proximity to BWI airport. You have to walk through the Casino to get to more food and the choices are slim. Vegetarian options were a negative. Some of the casino staff wouldn‚Äôt let you bring outside food back through the casino. You go up 3 floors, through the garage, and back down on the other side. When I tell you that this is dumb, it is an understatement!"

Overall it is a cool place to check out."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dC1iS3ZnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"I love Live Casino. I believe with the Sports Bar and open atmosphere feel it makes this place really nice for adults to hang out. They have tables and slots spread all over the place.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJazlMaWh3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"The newly open LIVE! Casino & Hotel. I booked this for a one night staycation and wanted to give it a shot.

We knew construction was still ongoing, so finding the entrance from the garage was a bit confusing but the best level to park on was P1 on the far side away from the Casino itself because this took you to the backside of the Casino which is where they have the new entrance for the Hotel. The moment you walk in to the hallway, you see the Gelato place and the gift shop all next to David's (the hotel restaurant). You honestly forget you were in the Live! Casino itself just a few seconds ago. The check-in staff was very attentive and helpful in finding our reservations and getting us on our way; the only bad part was I expected a $20 free play but because I had already gotten this credit a few years ago, they didn't give it to me.

We had our unit on the 8th floor for a King Suite with a bathtub and shower. It was a very spacious master suite, with a huge bathroom. The toilet and shower each had a separate glass door unit with a double vanity. The room had huge fantastic glass windows with a view to the Costco, still cool overall. The downside was the sound-proof of the room; we heard the planes outside since we were on the BWI runway side and also housekeeping having large conversations in the hallway sounded like they were inside our own room. I also was disappointed that they did not give hand soap (at least the little bars) for you to use. Also, the pillows were not what I expected in a luxury suite, not that comfortable.

The Keurig coffee machine was a nice plus to have in the room, along with an iron and ironing board. The attention to detail in having robes was also nice; the large screen TV was great (w/ plenty of channels and ability to link with your streaming apps). The nice touch of having a touch pad with your name was cool; it also has a built-in app for white noise which was helpful. Finally, having a couch (not that comfy), coffee table and office desk were nice pluses.

In regard to the Spa and Fitness center, we went down to see the Fitness center and overall were impressed with the equipment (mainly aerobics, but nice smith machines, kettle and dumbbells). We didn't see inside the Spa area but it looked very spacious. Otherwise, we went down to the Casino itself and played.

For the price we paid for a King suite, we expected a bit more (ie. some extras included). But definitely worth a shot!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dFpxVG9nRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"We are locals.. went to the hotel for drinks last night. Bartender was excellent, very friendly & great service. My margarita wasn‚Äôt anything special though . For 15 bucks it was a very mediocre drink. The entire bar area was dirty.. it‚Äôs a beautiful location but definitely dirty. I was disappointed with how dusty it was. The chair in front had a big wet stain. Floors were dirty as well. I‚Äôll give it another chance.. but if it‚Äôs in the same condition it will be my last."

You do not need to be a gambler to be here. You can go there for the food and just people watch.  If you‚Äôre looking to just have drinks with friends, it‚Äôs also the place to be at.  The crew that works there are just amazing and funny. They definitely go out of their way to make your time at the casino enjoyable and extremely pleasant.

Very nice!!! The food was good too! And that doesn't cover the 10 restaurants on-site. If you haven't been there before, go check it out. For a concert, dinner, or gambling and an overnight stay. There's something for everyone."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNLWVhTmRBEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"I had a great time seeing Gladys Knight. The venue size was just right, not too big. Every seat was a good one. There are plenty of restaurants and shops to keep you occupied before or after the show. I DON'T GAMBLE AT ALL and didn't appreciate having to walk through the casino to get to the theater; however,  if that's all I have to complain about, I'm good! üëçüèø There's valet parking, but it would be nice to have seating while waiting for the car.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJbjl5V19BRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"It's just ok... The place is very new, the design is modern and the rooms are nice, in fact - our bathroom was over the top beautiful and very spacious! Beautiful building in New area with lots of construction still going on. However, the prices are outrageous, the views not the best and the overall clientele is not the greatest... We were looking for a fun & somewhat fancy night out gambling and having some drinks, but the slots are unreasonably high priced with very little return (gambling over a dollar and winning back $0.08 doesn't seem reasonable...). Most of the other guests were in sweat pants and somewhat shady looking making us to feel uncomfortable... We won't be back!"

Definitely recommend."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNteEpxRFVBEAE,A Google Maps review about a french restaurant.,"You can consider LA CREME your go-to spot for small batch, organic artisan crepes. The Canela and Citron crepes are our favorites. Make sure to order them with strawberries.

The difference, as with most great restaurants, starts with using excellent ingredients. When we spoke to Kim, the owner of LA CREME, she explained that their toppings are either made in-house or sourced from high quality bakers and such is the whipped cream ‚Äî a delicious level of thickness with the right amount of sweet.

You can feel the attention to details in the decor. It‚Äôs down to earth with an elegant use of black and white with splashes of rose gold among the perfectly socially-distanced tables.

The staff is young, precise, and welcoming.

Overall a great experience that can rival those in Napa, where we‚Äôve been going for years.

One small change I would suggest is upgrading the coffee creamer. Pleased do away with the plastic containers. They just don‚Äôt fit within the ambiance LA CREME has created."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdXNHUTdRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a bar & grill.,"I typically enjoy eating here. I ordered some takeout steak salads and I requested 2 modifications. One was to remove the fries from it, and the other was to add a hard boiled egg, I hadn‚Äôt realized that it would cost an extra $3 for the egg. I get inflation is a mess, but that seems a bit ridiculous for 1 egg, which I‚Äôm sure is bought in bulk from a restaurant supplier.

I‚Äôm just a tad annoyed with the restaurant and to top it off, they didn‚Äôt give me any dressing. So all around a disappointment for a nearly $30 salad."

First and foremost, they do have really good wings. Let‚Äôs start off with the good. The not so good, was the service and the burgers. I did not enjoy my burger whatsoever. It was greasy and absolutely disgusting. The waitress clearly saw that I only took one small bite of my burger and never even questioned whether I liked it or not or if they could remake it. Still charged me full price & that was truly disappointing. Basic customer service adequate, would be to ask the customer if they enjoyed their food or how things were? But she clearly she did not. Overall, I would not return to this copperhead. I‚Äôve had much better experiences at the copperhead in Allentown."

The entrance was phenomenal !!!  and excellent customer service and atmosphere.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJbFBxSTRRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a bar & grill.,"My wife and I stopped here for lunch following a trip to Chriskindlemart.

We were quickly greeted by the hostess and or waitress Kim came over to us to take our order relatively quickly. She greeted us with a smile in a very friendly manner.

We both ordered the strawberry lemonade which is a great thirst quencher. For appetizers,  we shared the crab dip and brown butter buffalo wings which were delicious.

For meals, my wife had the crab cakes with brussel sprouts and the bacon twice baked potato. She said the crab cakes were very good but said the brussel sprouts,  although extremely tasty and flavorful,  were not fully cooked and were somewhat hard. She also said the twice baked potato filling was very good, but the skin of the potato was very hard and overcooked.

I had the butter garlic strip steak medium well with the broccoli, potato wedges and the stuffed potato.

The steak was served already sliced, and although not a huge problem, not something that I prefer. It was slightly over cooked. To me, medium well it's slightly pink in the center (serving temp around 160*) but it was cooked well done. Also, the menu says roasted garlic and herb butter. I didn't sense any butter on it and it came with quartered garlic on top. The wedges were very tasty and seasoned nicely as was the stuffed potato.

For dessert we had the funnel cake fried Oreo's which was delicious!

The presentation of all the food was exceptional. The cleanliness of the restaurant was superb. There wasn't a time when we didn't see someone cleaning.

Lastly, the food was not very expensive for the portions.

Excellent and not your typical...these were huge and there were five of them..more like logs as they're referred to by staff! And marinara dipping sauce was really good...just a slight kick to it.  Hubby then had  a crabcake and shrimp and chicken fajitas (he couldn't decide between the two as entr√©es so getting the crabcake as an add on worked out great!)...and I had the yummy strawberry apple walnut salad with chicken. The entire meal...and a few adult beverages...were perfect! And our server, Sammie (sp?) was so helpful, friendly and sweet... made our dining experience even more enjoyable.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcjczUERREAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Didn't play golf. Didn't play tennis. Didn't use the spa. Hardly gambled at all. But we did enjoy the pool and fitness area. The hotel has good facilities and nice rooms. At discounted online offer price, it's worth it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtLU83NkN3EAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"This was one of my favorite vacations ever. My girlfriend and I went on our anniversary and it was perfect. You really don't have to leave the resort for any reason. They have hot food cooked all night long, endless fun, and if you really wanted to leave, it is in close proximity to a few stores. It was an amazing time for us, and id definitely recommend it to others."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJM3UyRGZREAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Great place! We really enjoyed ourselves. All the staff are very friendly and offered tons of knowledge for it being our first time on a few of the table games! We stopped in at the restaurant and it was 5 stars all the way around, great friendly staff there as well! Must stop in if your I'm the area! Thanks again to all the staff that helped us!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdEo2czB3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"For my first time staying at this resort, it has a been a great experience so far. I would say that there are some things you get familiar with especially with the mini bar and it's accessibility. The staff has been friendly, no smoking in the casino areas which are an extreme plus and even the service in cleaning the rooms deserves some kudos as well. I will be back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJNGN6WnF3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"We stayed here last week in the King Suite. The room was 5 stars without a doubt. The hotel itself wasn't too bad either. The only complaint I have is the smell of cigarette smoke right when you walk in which is coming from the casino. The restaurants are overpriced and aren't that great. However, the food from room service is extremely good and reasonably priced. We ended up getting snowed in which was a bit of a bummer for our trip. Unfortunately due to the storm the tvs weren't working either. Luckily we were leaving the next day so it wasn't too bad. We came to the Poconos to do other activities so our stay wasn't based off the resort or casino. With that being said I'd definitely stay here again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJOF9xblhBEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"This place is very nice and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. If you have a gambling problem or don't know how to walk away then you shouldn't come but they're other friends of entertainment that you might enjoy. Famous restaurants to eat at, a lounge, a pool, a golf course depending on  the weather and planned events so if be sure to look up the events if you want to attend so you can book accordingly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdTZYeHFnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Lovely place. Great casino. Very clean. They have a company come in and disinfect every room between visitors. Restaurants surrounding the casino floor, so there's plenty to do and eat."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbjctcDRnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Very Disappointed with their rooms and cleaning service.
$500 for a room for 1 night.
Immediately upon walking into the room we were greeted by cigerett smoke stench. A broken door card reader cover, candle wax on the bathroom floor. And hair in the shower. We stayed without complaining.....with the exception of notifying the front desk of the horrible  cigerett smoke smell, just because i wasn't going to get charged a cleaning fee for something that wasn't us. It was our first night out together in a long time so we weren't going to let that ruin our evening.......as we had a blast at the casino and restaurants. When I brought it to the managements attention upon check out, I was offered an apology.
But in closing......I learned we'll stay somewhere else from now on!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbDRiTmVnEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"This Hotel/Resort is beautiful. I stayed in the Hotel. The room itself was large enough, clean and did not smell of smoke. The lobby and other areas do smell badly of cigarettes. That is the only reason they lost a star for me. Even the restaurant areas reek of cigarette smoke, even though they are smoke free. With the Casino being in the middle of everything and obviously allowing smoking, the other areas suffer. Guy Fieri's Restaurant is the place to go! Don't waste your time or money on the other mediocre Restaurants."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdUpqTzFBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,Not a bad place went to Gui Fieri restaurant 24/7 diner. They only serve 1 breakfast option all day long. But the food was amazing. I had the pulled pork and I could barely finish my fries. It was amazing but kind of pricey. Good date spot if u have money to spend.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5LUpfbE1BEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"I have stayed here before with no issue but this time was different the service was sub-par at best. The ice machine on the main floor was broken so we had to travel to the 2nd floor and sometimes the 3rd floor to get ice. Tonight it was late so we called room service for some ice water not only did we call 3x but I finally had to call the front desk to call them just to bring the water. Over an hour later here they come with 5 cups of water and charged $10.00. Then said It's room service, It's not my fault the ice machine is inoperable and has been since the day we arrived, and we made management aware of the ice machineand he said we will get that taken care of immediately if immediately was a date it would be when the pandemic is over! Needless to say I won't be back it only takes one time for the foolishness!"

ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURFczdoLRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Nice rainy day place to enjoy. Not sure of the views do to the weather, but I think we could have seen the mountains from there. Beautiful decor inside. We dinned at the Buffet and food was delicious and they had many choices for all palates. We even walked out being winners. We enjoyed our visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcDlQWXZ3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,I'm not a fan of casinos but went to visit one of the restaurants and play a few dollars in the slots.  We always set an amount that we're willing to pay for a few hours of entertainment and that's all we spend.  It's our own game of how long will it take to lose this amount to the house.  In this case it was not nearly as much fun as it use to be.  The slots are 100% video games and everyone in our group felt like we were just spectators watching the games play themselves with our money.  Give me a handle to pull or something that makes me feel like I'm more involved otherwise I might as well just stay home and watch TV.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwbDdtN0FnEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,We ate at the Guy Fieri grill. The  fried macaroni balls with the cheese bacon fondue was incredible!  The blood Mary with the candied bacon was the best. My fiance had the west coast burger it was superb! The slots were generous the food was delicious. Hands down one of the best casinos resort entertainment on the east coast! Thank you so much for a wonderful evening!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJZ3Z2TlRREAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"I like the layout of the casino. It's very open and a fun place to wander.

It's an adventure, and the table games are second to none.

The staff are very attentive and the wait staff that patrol the floor do very well. I've never been asked that much if I needed anything.

Played a lot of video slots and had a blast.
Saw some upcoming performances that I would like to see!!! Excellent!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzXy1YR2FBEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Place is very nice. Rooms are all updated and very clean. Would have given it 5 stars but....

Took forever to get our rooms.

Food selections are very limited. Food staff seems very disorganized and it takes a long time to get served even when it is empty. But food was very good once it arrived, a half hour later.

No live music or bar/entertainment venues. Not like the Hard Rock Casinos.  It is basically just a Casino.

Pool is very crowded and open to outside guests, non-hotel guests, therefore they take all the seats and nothing is left for hotel guests. Very strange policy, and they yell at you if you sit in the coach area. What are you to do when there are no other seats available. Very odd.

Hotel itself is very nice and helpful."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNMGI3N2NREAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Great casino...nice slot choices and lots of winners (that I witnessed & myself included)...clean rooms with very comfortable beds and modern design.  Room service food was great but had a horrible experience at the buffet (dirty plates & tasteless food).  Customer service reached out promptly after I reviewed on FB...asked for my number to discuss but never called. Overall I'd definitely go back...I mean comp rooms so why not, plus the other restaurants were good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtb1pHOEZ3EAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because there's no fridge in the room. Other than that, it's a fabulous place to enjoy with your loved one. The room was spotless when I got there. The staff is friendly. If there's any issue, they show up right away to fix it. This is a hidden gem üíé in the Poconos. We will be back. It's worth what they charge for the stay."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dWEtVTZRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Rooms are clean and view of course and lake is great. Casino was okay, wish they had a few more tables open. Golf course is one of the best I've played. The view is the best part of the course."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cE92Ql9nRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Absolutely recommend this resort! Beautiful decor and VERY friendly staff. Our room, a suite, was appropriately sized and fun to be in, also was able to check in 1.5 hours early so that was also very sweet to the price deal. The pool i recommend going early if enjoying adults only type of time, by 2-3pm lots of kiddos around. Bistecca was SUPER delicious and wait staff was very friendly and attentive. The live band playing last night 8/12 was jamming pretty well, i didnt stick around to give a full listen though. The cabanas were amazing to utilize, you also get to use the pool before/after checkout so thats a plus. Only gripes would be: unless you valet, theres no separate parking for the hotel, so you either walk thru the casino(which is probably designed on purpose) or walk around the outside, about a 5 min walk. Also, be prepared if going/leaving during peak times as your mixed in with regular casino goers so you may end up in the back of the lot. Secondly, theres not a lot of communication; in terms of staff to staff and promoting. Know before you go, the ONLY place to ACTUALLY get breakfast is Fieri's kitchen (other pption is a starbucks) unless you pay attention to the changing directory sign, you have no indication thats it for breakfast. Thirdly, the buffet opens an hour AFTER checkout, again, breakfast is the cheapest meal to execute so dropping the ball there too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVdmI2Qkp3EAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"This place is great, they are top notch clean and professional.  Very attentive and polite. The beds are comfortable and you cant get excess to the hotel rooms from the elevator without a key. You will need it for the elevator to move. The pool was nice and big with options to go outside or stay inside. The only thing is there is no hot tub which is what I was looking for.  They have about 4 restaurants onsite and a casino all in the same location. We went to the buffet which h coat about 16.99 a person. Food and desert was really good. Drinks are included in that price. They have a guys burger which was really good.we got to the hotel early and there no hesitation to allow us to have our room early.  It was cleaned amd ready. They dont really have a walking trail which is what I was looking for giving the location and the beautiful views here. This hotel has high glass decorations all over bery detailed amd beautiful I really enjoyed. They had a bar are at the pool which is were you would get your towels. Like I said the food was good the rooms were very nice. I got a glass stand up shower. The toilet has it's own door for extra privacy. You will not regret coming here I would say a 5 star hotel for sure."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtZ3NDSkhnEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Got an awesome deal from Groupon for 1 night. We arrived at 6pm, free valet, were quickly checked in, and down enjoying the pool by 7pm where we wound down with a drink and a swim. Afterwards we showered, had some delicious appetizers at Guy Fieri‚Äôs then hit the casino floor  for a few hours before calling it a night. The beds are so comfy I didn‚Äôt feel my partner move all night. We just woke up and had an amazing breakfast at GF‚Äôs and are packing up before heading back down to enjoy the pool for a couple more hours before we hit the road for our next destination.
Few complaints: the parking. Your options are valet and waiting or self-parking outside the casino and making the trek up to your room. It is a bit slow moving process if you choose valet. Also, the mini fridges are packed with items that will get charged to your room if removed. They don‚Äôt leave you any space for you own items that need to be refrigerated.
Overall and for the deal we got, we are very pleased."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeE9qWmZBEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,This casino was fantastic. Not only did they help us out with a last-minute in the middle of the night booking for a room but they were very accommodating and always. I like the fact that the casino was smokeless and you didn't get a whiff of cigarettes as you walk through it. They also have a really nice scent that is piped through that makes it smell kind of tropical. The restaurants were great the amenities were fantastic. Just a great smaller casino that was fantastic overall.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcHRXWGZnEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,We had booked a week ahead. Yet when we came with friends & family. We were separated from how we booked during check in. Pool & Spa place was amazing though. Casino was FUN. Would definitely recommend coming again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5X0tlX3pRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Peaceful place to stay, rooms are a little stuffy no matter how much you adjust the thermostat, it does not work. Gorgeous scenery. The rooms are nice and clean, and the staff is friendly however, for the amount of money charged for the stay the in room amenities could be much better. There's a wet bar as well as snacks such as nuts, pretzels, etc. DO NOT TOUCH them because you will be charged significantly! Don't even accidentally knock over a can of pretzels or you will be charged as it is weight sensitive. There is no microwave or refrigerator for personal use. You can rent a refrigerator for $26.50 per day. I believe that there is an option to rent the microwave as well. When checking out there are several additional charges such as a $12 food charge, $27.75 beverage charge, a $75 service charge, and another charge for $75 that says other. None of these charges were discussed prior to or during check in. It's evident that this place is about getting their money but, my husband and I enjoyed ourselves. However, I will never stay at this resort again."

The casino was great, walked out with a few hundred in the positive! The only downfall of this place, half the bar in the middle of the casino floor, is non smoking, but you can take two steps to the right and smoke, it's not well thought out at all. Another con, they don't have a huge variety of restaurants, and there's no shopping stores... they have one small gift shop but if you want to treat yourself to a new outfit, there's nowhere to get clothes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdzl2NXF3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Beautiful resort, spa and casino. Only reasons I am giving it a 4 star are; no refrigerator, no microwave, and the weighted snack tray. (If you bump, pick up or move anything, you would be charged).

Also the buffet in the casino was terrible - so heads up on that. Not worth the 20+ dollars. Also, the gentleman that was cutting the Meats, sneezed on his forearm and didn't even go wash off- went back to carving."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNU1UY0hBEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,The suite was amazingly comfortable.  Love the soaker tub.  Food was good.  Sushi was yummy.  Pool was great especially for the winter.   The signature massage was unbelievably awesome and reasonably priced.  I went during the week so no crowds at all. Friendly staff.  My husband was able to fully function his telework off of their Wi-Fi with no problems. If I could change anything I would prefer a fridge in the room in place of the mini bar.  And wish they had room service.  That's why only 4 stars.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0NU5TVWlBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,The design of the building is attractive. The location in the mountains and the lake in front are picturesque. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was quite busy. The grounds and building were clean. The one negative that stood out to me was the lack of staff. Having a long wait in line to get a rewards card and difficulty in finding a drink waitress. There are plenty of slot machines and table games. The outside music venue looked great. I look forward to returning this summer to attend a concert.

One criticism that I would have is that you to pay a $20 a night resort fee and then when you go to the pool there is an indoor outdoor pool combination and a tunnel that connects the 2. But they did not heat The outdoor pool and the water in the indoor pool was quite cold as the to waters intermixed.
The sports book is a lot of fun and the fact that we could take our own food and beverage is in there made it all the more."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbUxyNUp3EAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Spent the afternoon in the casino and went to the buffet. Had a really good time... Highly recommend checking it out and definitely eat while there, u won't be disappointed... Did not stay in a room tho!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMXRpU1FREAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Small casino compared to other ones I‚Äôve been to (Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods). We stayed for a night in the Center Suite as a mini getaway from home.

They allowed us to check-in early, which was nice, especially since my husband wanted to take my toddler to the pool. Toddler had fun in the pool, but besides that there wasn‚Äôt much to do for the little one.
Ate dinner at one of the restaurants on the casino floor and then spent rest of the evening in the room watching tv (not much option). Ordered room service for breakfast the next day before we went home. There was nothing special about it and coffee had a horrible cleaning supply taste to it. Pretty expensive especially since 18% gratuity was included in the room service bill

For those planning to visit with underaged kids, you will need to be escorted at all times in the casino area even if you are just heading to the restaurant inside.

I would probably come again once more just so my toddler could use the pool and I also heard good things about the spa"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDcTliazN3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Since I don't have photos from the night, here's a card I made for my mom. I took her here for her 50th birthday since some of the other plans I had for her fell through during the pandemic. I should have chosen this first! She loves to gamble and we had so much fun. She really enjoyed herself. I think they did a good job making it a safer place for indoor entertainment; everyone was masked and spaced. My only suggestion would be wipes available for the slots(although I'm not sure the erosive damage this could cause) and periodic hand sanitizing stations. We ended up eating at Guy Fieri's which has classic American food and large portions."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcy1iN293RRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"This place is absolutely amazing. Great for weekend getaway. I had an amazing time, casino and restaurants are open 24 hours, the pool and spa was absolutely relaxing. I only give them a 4 star because the buffet food was really disappointing."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtc3NpZ1h3EAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Awesome, quaint place.  Not real big, but not real crowded either.  Easy to find a space at a table game.  Slots seem to pay out way better than the Philly area warehouse joints.  Hotel is super nice and clean.  Worth the 2 hour drive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbC12MzdBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"If you enjoy the intoxicating smell of cigarettes and the company of elderly citizens then this little casino in the Poconos is right up your alley. Limited space, typical casino atmosphere and mediocre overpriced restaurants. If you come here for anything it would be the headlining acts but really nothing else really draws you here. Trying to get a drink while you‚Äôre at the slot machine takes hours and you have to flag down a server whenever one happens to come by. Not much else to see or do here, not great but not extremely awful either"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRc2ZqMGlBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,Very classy and clean. Everyone was dressed to impress. I love feeling like I was stepping back in time when I was playing the slot machines. I only went to the casino part so I don't know anything about the hotel. This place is huge I had to asked the staff witch way I came in as I was lost and couldn't remember where I parked my car üòÇ luckily these two men remembered witch way we came and pointed us to the right direction. I love üòç how beautiful everything was.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNWVybHZnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Have a good time, just wish they did more promotional credits and give aways like they used to.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDOS1pSXpRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Fast and easy check in. Everything in one place! Beautiful spa and I truly enjoyed my massage from Hubert!  I also appreciated that I got a discount for being in uniform ""nurse""! Its nice to be appreciated during this pandemic! Plus, it was a discount for ANYONE that wears a uniform, not just health care workers! Pool area was...  not strict with covid compliance and slow service although it appeared to be fully staffed. Water was warm and I loved that I could swim through to go outside! Watch your head! üôÉ Ask for a high floor so you can enjoy the view! My room was a lake view and well... see pictures! Overall it was great to get away and I got some good sleep!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzdDdfc1FnEAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"I stayed here for Valentine's Day weekend. The hotel was beautiful. We stayed in a king suite. It was top notch. The room was really nice and spacious. There one thing that I did not like about the hotel was that they had no refrigerator in the room. Ice machines were available though. The service was nice. The bell guy Bob was really nice. He bought all of my luggage up to my room and put everything away for me. I was amazed about the hospitality here. When valet bought me my car, they had my heated seats on for me. I like that the people at the hotel care about you. My bathroom was huge with his/ her sinks. My husband and I could fit in the shower together. I had a mini bar in my room. I will stay here again when I visit the Poconos. I kept winning at the casino. I played the slot machines(Wheel of Fortune $1 machine). Overall, fun and great experience"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydDc3c1BREAE,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"Nice casino, perfect for a quick ride. Fun, slower & more relaxing pace than Atlantic city.

We took a hotel shuttle to the casino and walked around a bit. It's very nice, pretty, with gaming tables. We played roulette for a couple hours and made some good cash. I really liked it. Can't wait to go back. We ate a late night snack at Guy Fieris, yummy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhMzdQUnlRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a casino.,"The view coming up to the resort was breathtaking. The resort is perfectly nestled in the rolling hills with a mountain back drop. Valet service is included with your stay. They are very quick and efficient. Check in was easy, and our room was clean with a beautiful view. The staff all over the resort are friendly and helpful. They have a wide variety of slots, roulette, card games, etc all with varying limits. Restaurants in the resort are pricey, but the food is good. We spent a whole week in the resort, and took full advantage of everything they have to offer. The gift shop isn't much, but it does have toiletries for purchase if you forget something back home."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4eGJmSFhnEAE,A Google Maps review about a boat rental service.,"After a few years of renting boats from a local competitor that always had issues (non existent bimini, broken gas gauge, engine that was leaking gas, dirty and old boats, etc), i decided to try a new rental place.

I rented the 18 foot 150hp Bowrider.  There were no massive issues like before.  The boat was clean, fast, and fun.  The stereo didn't work but we had a wireless water proof speaker for this anyways.  We rented for 3 days and came back once for a fuel up in between.

The only downside was that we hit an underwater log in the middle of the lake.  They showed me the damage to the skeg and as I had taken a pic of the prop/skeg before the rental, it was undeniable.  Got hit with a $350 charge for repair, but I can't blame Yankee as this is part of the risk of boating.

I will be renting from Yankee from now on."

Simply put, the owners are great people and the crew they hire is the best. They are all personable, kind, and hard working. The boats they rent are perfect for all your basic needs on Lake George - tubing, water skiing, fishing, picnicking on an island in the Narrows,  or just moored up at Sandy Bay.  They are well maintained and clean.  I highly recommend choosing Yankee over any other marina."

Obviously it was impossible to take advantage of much of the amenities like the pool, playground etc. The gift shop was nice and had some items we purchased. Ate one meal from the bar/cafe as take out due to covid restrictions and outside seating was a bit cold, although they did have several heaters out. The cabin, 5B was clean, warm and romantic. On Valentine's Day a staff member brought a rose and a card to our room. Nice touch folks! I will recommend the Lone Fir to friends.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzanJLVFB3EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I was so impressed with Perdido Beach Resort at our recent conference. All of the staff went above and beyond to meet our needs and facilitate the conference. Front desk staff,  catering/restaurant staff, maid service staff were all excellent.  My hotel room was beautiful, clean and comfortable.  The complimentary valet parking was so appreciated upon arrival! The food at all meals was wonderful.  The lobby, with live music in the evenings, was such a pleasure.
Looking forward to returning.
One suggestion I would make is to get rid of the plastic table attached to the balcony railing in the ocean-front rooms. It obscures the view - not so much when you're standing in the doorway, but when you're seated in the room, it really blocks the view. And, while I see the benefit of the bar-height stools on the balcony, for enhanced viewing while on the balcony, they are very uncomfortable after about 5 minutes.  I have a bad back.  I called the desk to request a regular height chair for the balcony, but none were available.  I ended up buying a chair to use on the balcony - left it in the room, as I didn't have room to take it with me.  If you're planning to replace the rest of the balcony chairs with the plastic bar table and bar stool chairs, please reconsider - maybe offer both, or have some regular chairs available, upon request. If you've already committed to installing the balcony bar table, please consider moving it to the edge of the balcony so it doesn't obstruct the view so much from within the room. One small suggestion in a wonderful stay.
There was a very long wait (45 minutes) on the phone to make a reservation. We had to phone in to get the conference rate. Once I reached a reservationist, everything was great.
The live music in the lobby was most memorable. It just made me happy every time I walked through. The musician did an excellent job."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc3J1MU13EAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"As a local from Baldwin County, the Perdido Beach Resort is a great option for anyone wanting to spend some time at the beach! It could be challenging to someone not familiar with Orange Beach to decide where to stay, but this place will not disappoint!

Situated just west of Alabama Point at the bridge, the PB Resort is located near The Gulf, a great casual dining option, plus other dining options across the street and nearby. The famous Flora-Bama is just a short drive east!

The PB Resort offers ample parking, but it does fill up quickly. On-site valet is also available. To enter the hotel, you can walk up the side-facing stairs leading from the parking below or remain on the lower level and follow the sidewalk around beneath the upper level.

Upon checking in, we received elastic wristbands that were our room key. Definitely an easy way to keep up with your key instead of always fumbling around in pockets, etc.

Our room was very clean! There was no carpet in our room, just vinyl plank style flooring. A nice upgrade from gross hotel carpet you often find nowadays. We had a small balcony with a bar height table & chairs, that offered a great side view, West facing both the Gulf & the adjacent cove area/ Robinson Island across the street.

The outside bar/patio offers great drinks & food! I thought it was interesting that each time I ordered a Mango Margarita, I got something different but still tasty lol. Bartenders were friendly and quick! Food was also good.

The pool & surrounding grounds are great & create a nice relaxing atmosphere. There was also live music on the days we were there.

Voyagers, one of the many restaurants inside is great! Perfect for date night, or any other celebration.

Really love this hotel! Great for families and everyone visiting Orange Beach!"

Nice pools, very short walk to the beautiful white sand beach, and a workout room that includes 3 Pelatons. This is a great hotel and we had a great time."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcjlqaTdnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Great place to stay. Just stayed here for 3 nights for a conference. I stayed in the East Tower in a brand new renovated room. The rooms were very nice, extremely clean, tons of space, had a balcony, and nice sized bathroom. The room also had a safe, half fridge, microwave, mini bar area with sink. The bed was very comfortable. The lobby area was all brand new and very nice. The bartenders were all great. Resort is located right on the beach, can‚Äôt beat that. Looking forward to returning again next year."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3NlB5RFZBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"When I called to make arrangements with them. I told them what I wanted/expected and they delivered. I believe that we had the best room in the whole resort. I love the fact that everything is right there. We drove in instead of flying so after 12 hours we didn't want to be in the car any longer. They have everything. Your food, alchohol, and if u forgot anything from home, there is a good chance the gift shop has it.

The restaurants available had some amazing food. Not a huge pizza fan but the pizzeria is really good.

Oh and did I mention you can take your alchohol anywhere?  We loved that. You can bring your own or choose from a couple of different bars on site. One of the staff told us only rule was no glass outside. So if you choose to bring your own, make sure u buy cans or aluminum bottles. Also allow coolers on the beach but not in the pool area.

Hotel was very clean (yes I inspected it),every staff member we came in contact from bell hop to bar tenders were super nice and very helpful with any questions we had.

We recommend Perdido Beach Resort to anyone looking for a place in this area. We will definitely be back many times over."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVN1BMTEFnEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"This place is amazing! If you book, try to get a room on the 8th floor. It's very restricted and you must use your room key card to even get on that floor. It also has a lounge where they offer cocktail hour and free breakfast every day. Also you can go in at any time and get free canned and bottled drinks,  candy bars and chips. This hotel also has beach towels to use on the beach or at the pool free. The rooms are very clean and nice. The beds are so soft and comfortable. The landscaping is beautiful. The staff are all so friendly and willing to help in any way. It's the only hotel I will go to when I return to Orange Beach! Please like my post! Thank you!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZd0lIZnZnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,Absolutely loved my stay here. Staff was very professional and greeted you with a smile each time. The only reason I could not give 5 stars was due to a minor issue with our room. When taking a shower the tub would fill up with water instead of draining. Like I said other than that a great place to stay!

Has a few bars with food as well as a coffee shop in house for those who need caffeine.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOFptanp3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our first stay at Perdido Key Resort. It is one of the cleanest resorts that I have ever visited. Special thank you to Don and Kadine who cleaned our room prior to our visit and left their card. The room has plenty of charging stations even one if you forgot to bring the wall block and wire. Wifi and valet are complementary. Additionally, it is maintained well as we constantly saw the friendly staff working. Voyagers (the fine dining restaurant), Latitude 30, a pizza place ? Name with Icees and Hershey‚Äôs ice cream, and an outdoor bar and grill are all on site. They were all delicious (and great service). The rooms are not cleaned until after checkout unless a guest requests cleaning. Any extra towels or other necessities are available upon request. I always prefer not having cleaning service during my stays at hotels. I‚Äôm good with making my own bed, or not, because I‚Äôm on vacation. Bottom line is this resort exceeded all my expectations, and we were really impressed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoajhURGx3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"At this resort for a work conference. Beautiful spot right on the beach. Indoor/outdoor pool, hot tubs, gym, restaurants on site. Rooms are clean & updated.

Highly recommend Brooke at the poolside bar & Melvin at Latitude restaurant! Fantastic service."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlODVfSlJBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,Beautiful resort for events and vacation but good to ask if there are any conferences/events before you book if that is a concern.  Rooms are nice and plenty of food and beach amenities to experience the beautiful white sand beaches.  A nice touch was the larger than normal fitness center full of life fitness and hammer strength equipment.  Overall one of the nicer resorts in the area.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnbk9hTUpBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Perdido Beach Resort starts first with the wonderful people who run the hotel like Susan Newsom who made sure our stay for our 38th anniversary was PERFECT.  The rooms are clean and quiet and the breakfast this morning was fast and the omelet chef made a creation that Wolfgang Puck would be proud to share.   If you want a great place to enjoy the beach with wonderful people to take care of you book now.

Update.

The last night we decided to dine at Voyager's.  Eddie got us the perfect window table and the cuisine is the best on the coast from Pensacola to Orange beach you won't find a better view or better service or better steaks.  Save room for dessert.  I do recommend reservations.

Final Thoughts

Well we have been gone for a few days and the glow of a wonderful weekend at PBR is still warning our hearts and we continue to smile.  We are looking forward to returning soon to enjoy the nicest people, the best food and the best service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnMjlTbnJ3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"It's a pretty nice place. Very convenient to have shops and restaurants on site. Beach access right off the pool is great. The beach is very well taken care of.

The chairs and umbrellas on the beach are for rent. We got out there early and we weren't away of that so we were told nicely to move our stuff. We didn't rent from them as we had our own things but the option is great.

The pool is a pretty big size. It was too cold for us enjoy it though but so was the beach. We went 5/23-5/27. It's not a heated pool. Wish it was and we could have enjoyed it. The temperature when we went was high 70s, 14mph winds and felt amazing outside of the water. If the pool was heated, it would have been amazing. The kiddie pool is also nice but also not heated.

We stayed in room 601 and Our room was nice, room service and house keeping were great. We didn't have enough towels or know how to turn on the shower on but we called house keeping and they were there in seconds with more towels and shower us the shower. (You just pull down on a fixture directly under faucet lol and to turn it off, you just shut the water off. I felt a little dumb haha) Our room had a fridge but no microwave. Beds are super comfy. But oh!!! The sliding door had me about to rip it out. The sliding balcony door has a frame that is above the floor. I stubbed my toe on that frame at least 15 times while I was there and by the last time I did it I wanted to rip out that door. My daughter also stubbed her toe a few times and cried every time. It hurts! So beware of that door. Not sure if all the rooms are like that but 601, yes. I warned you.

Breakfast buffet was super good! Definitely give it a go. Priced well too. The pizza downstairs is also really... Really good!

This was our first time to Orange Beach/Gulf shores and it was nice. If you plan on chilling on the beach of resort the whole time, I would recommend this place. We didn't find much else to do here. Yeah there's a park and The Track is pretty cool but I was expecting to see a bunch of restaurants and activities. None of that here. It's nothing compared to Destin which is just 90 min away but if I go back, and the price is right, I'll stay at this resort again.

Staff was super friendly and helpful. From the time time we checked in to the time we checked out, we felt super welcomed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVX0xHcTNnRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Beach side room with a gorgeous view! Poolside live music during the afternoon and poolside grill and an ice cream shop just inside. Live piano music in the evenings, too! Loved our stay there!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnbHRYTDV3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"We stayed at Predido for an anniversary vacation and enjoyed a wonderful experience.  Can't say enough of the great staff. Special kudos for Brittany (the Club Level hostess), all the bellmen and valets. What great bunch for folks! We loved the pool area and overall facilities. Pool area bartenders were terrific. Food all downstairs grill and pizzeria was delicious.  Next time we stay in the area, it will be at Predido Resort!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aGFlZlhREAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"I stayed here for the NENA conference last year, and I'd heard only negative things about the hotel.  I'm happy to say they were wrong!

The hotel underwent a renovation at some point in the last few years so the rooms are more modern.  From what my co-worker said it ""used to look like a dump"".  There are some issues with quality of the rooms where it looks like a flipper did them.  An example is the shower doors where they will slide open on their own.  My room as well as my co-worker had this issue.

The pool is very large with a nice bar and a window to order food and drinks from while outside.  There is also a clear walking path to the beach.  There is an inside and outside pool area.  The inside area has a hot tub and a little area for swimming inside (it's connected to the main pool, so if it storms - you'll need to get out).  The inside area is slippery, so watch your footing and DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS RUN.  The main large pool has a walk over bridge and a gazebo where live music was played every day I was there.

If you want food, they have two restaurants that serve dinner (one casual and one fancy), but they are a little pricey.  The fancier option you'll need to make a reservation for as they are small and don't have space for walk ins.  There is also a little cafe that is open in the mornings with coffee and muffins."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2cWIyYWpBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Amazing resort. Comfortable rooms, valet parking, and the pool side bar and bartenders were the best"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVak1xZnZBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"A very, very nice resort. We stayed there for a couple of days during the 4th of July. Their breakfast buffet was very good with omelettes made any way you like them. The fireworks display was right in front of the resort on the gulf. Great fireworks display with an all you can eat bbq buffet prior to the fireworks. We had excellent weather and the room very nice with an excellent view of the Gulf of Mexico! We attended a concert (Tedeschi Trucks Band and Blackberry Smoke) at the Wharf Amphitheater which was just a few miles away and needless to say the resort pool and the ocean was incredible! Plenty of things to do including boat rides, parasailing, restaurants galore and plenty of shopping. Over all, we had an excellent time with the only drawback being a whole week would have been nice!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3b3FIeHVBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"My mother in law, sister in law, and I took a short girls trip (my 3yr old son also tagged along) & spent 2 nights here and LOVED it. Everyone was extremely friendly. We enjoyed the pier that led to the private beach. It lit up at night, which was nice. I had wished that for the amount of money we were spending on the room, at least breakfast would be included. That and the fact that the separate 2ft kiddie pool was not well lit at night, no lights around it at all, are the only reasons I am giving less than 5 stars. However, although a bit pricy, I can say that the breakfast buffet was VERY good. The servers were great. I would definitely recommend having dinner at Cotton's up the road also! Overall, we had a great girls trip and I can say we will be back! ** I have added photos of the view from our room on the 4th level and a photo of the kiddie pool during the day. **"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRM1pIYjNBRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"What a beautiful place! Went here for a weekend getaway, and had the club level room.

Snacks and drinks are available all the time in the lounge and you can get complimentary adult beverages and breakfast at certain times a day. Coming back!!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZdklTS1JBEAE,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"Fantastic experience at this property, starting with our bellman, Nathan Searcy! Loaded everything (we own between 4 people) onto one bell cart, brought it to our room and unloaded it, all with a smile and a ""no worries"" attitude. Thank you for such a smooth transition from our vehicle to our room.

Our stay was primo at this resort. Nothing outrageously fancy but everything we could ask for in a weekend impromptu beach visit. This ""end"" of the beach was not crowded (in early May) possibly due to the jetty we were situated near, as the property is near the waterway and bridge. This actually made for an awesome location! We perched till sunset and enjoyed the view."

Awesome fun for any age kids. They are in walking distance of the jetties if you like to fish but not for the faint of heart those rocks are treacherous. Also only a very short drive from Zekes Marine Mrs Brianna is the boat"

I have only 2 things to say that would make the stay more pleasant, and those are: 1. Get better toilet paper. The stuff they have is so thin you can‚Äôt wipe your nose without putting a hole in it. And the coffee in the rooms was just awful. I like Royal cup but that bold stuff was undrinkable."

Don‚Äôt want to go off property for breakfast, lunch, or dinner? No problem, all the restaurants on property are excellent. Check out my Voyager‚Äôs restaurant review.  Rooms are nice and you get an excellent view from every room. Some views are better than others but you can always see the beach.  The outside and inside pool are nice.  Plenty of lounge chairs.  Reserve your beach chair early and for your entire stay, that‚Äôs how you save money.  Rooms were cleaned daily, an all around excellent experience."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwby11SXZ3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"This was by far the best hotel experience we‚Äôve ever had! The outside didn‚Äôt impress much but once you walk it it was like a dream. The staff was absolutely amazing and I don‚Äôt think there was much they wouldn‚Äôt do to help us make our stay the best it could be! The pools were very nice, and the indoor pool does not have a closing time which is great because we usually save swimming for the end of the day when we get back after exploring. It was about 55-60 degrees but the outdoor pool still felt nice because it‚Äôs heated. Inside has 2 hot tubs! The room itself was pretty standard, but the view was unbeatable (after they upgraded us free of charge just because they had the availability!) the beach is absolutely beautiful as well.

(Add on statement) This resort has live entertainment around the pool during the day and in the lobby at night.  The talent here is unbelievable!  We witnessed 3 gentleman that put on an impromptu show that was incredible!!  You could not walk through the lobby without stopping to listen.  The piano player (John Brust) is here regularly, the clarinet (Tom Owen) stops in occasionally, and the trumpet (Roger Reupert) was here on vacation and say in. This is well worth stopping in for a free (tips) show, even if you can't get a room here!!  See YouTube where I will post a video in a few days."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eVp2QW1nRRAB,A Google Maps review about a hotel.,"The hotel phone and online reservation staff, parking lot, and conference staff are disconnected and disjointed.

I WOULD NOT recommend this place for a conference just based on trying to reserve a room and set up for conferences.

The front desk folks are nice and polite.

I COULD NOT stay at the hotel because they would answer the phone and transferred me to a number that would just disconnect you and emails go unanswered or vague responses with no answers to your questions.

They seem to be focused on valet services and conference fees but making vendors at conferences jump through hoops. You must leave keys with the valet to unload and you can't use the side doors because it bypasses the valet.

They respond with the ability to ignore your issues with short useless comments."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLa1A2Y1l3EAE,A Google Maps review about a italian restaurant.,"Very economical. This sampler I got had 4 different things on it using a big plate. For $3 more, you get a salad and drink. All said and done, about $12 for everything, and it was a ton of food. Service was great. Food was prepared quickly, very friendly people, and attentive to check up on you. Bread sticks (when dining in) are unlimited, and they come hot and fresh, buttered and seasoned with garlic. They are super soft and fluffy. Honestly, I rate their breadsticks above Olive Gardens. They are wonderful. Reasons why I‚Äôm not going with 5 stars, is nothing that this location has control over. It‚Äôs not a complaint of the individual location itself. First issue is, I felt the Alfredo sauce was very bland. I‚Äôve had stuff out of a jar at home that beats it. Secondly, the amount of sauce (all 3 pastas had the same issue) they put on is very little compared to the noodles you get. My feeling is, I can buy a pound of uncooked noodles for $1 at the store. After they absorb the water, you‚Äôve got 2lbs of noodles for $1. Commercially, they buy them much cheaper than that even. Noodles are incredibly cheap. Yet, you‚Äôre not really given enough sauce for them. Since pasta is so cheap, you‚Äôd think they could afford another 50 cents of sauce. The picture makes it look ok because it‚Äôs all on the top. It certainly looks like a decent amount of sauce. But you can‚Äôt see the noodle to sauce ratio. Also, I assume they have a pre-specified ladle size they are told to use. However, mix things up (or eat the top portion), and you‚Äôll quickly find yourself eating plain noodles. Again, I‚Äôm sure this is a corporate thing, and not location specific, but you‚Äôre reading my review because you want an honest review, right? So, I‚Äôm going to tell my experience as it was. Over all, I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars still, as service is good, breadsticks are wonderful, and food was pretty good, aside from the lack of sauce. Go in there prepared with this info, and see what you think. And remember, those wonderful breadsticks... they are unlimited. They will keep bringing more if you want. And, you‚Äôll likely want them to."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZcWRhZTh3RRAB,A Google Maps review about a american restaurant.,"I've eaten there, and now I work there. So I get to see the food ""behind the scenes"". Most, if not all, is homemade in the sense that whoever the cook is, they will cook it their own way with their own ingredients like they would in their own home. So you get to try the same food about 4 to 5 different ways which I think is pretty awesome. The cooks take allergy warnings very seriously. The owners come in pretty much every day to make sure we dont stray off of the path that they made to build this restaurant and its food upon. We have SO many return customers that when they're off work they will hang out with us from open to close. We strive to be extra friendly and helpful! And our MANY return customers can verify.  We have 2 flat screens to watch your sports on or for your child to watch cartoons so you can eat with some peace (lol). Our food is great tasting. Certain waitresses will buy 4 to 5 bowls of homemade cream of crab soup to take home for the night. As an example. So if we trust the food enough to eat it AND buy it in bulk, I'm sure you will love your dinner! Since I started working 1 month ago, I have yet to hear not even one complaint. If I work somewhere that's not all that good, I'm not afraid to say so. So I promise I'm not on here because anyone told me to, or to try to gain more customers etc. I simply rated it because my phone noticed how often I come here and asked me to review it LOL. Dont be afraid to give it a try. The portions range from ""good size for the money"" to ""Massive""! We are located inside the Laurel De Truck Stop/gas station with the Hardees hooked to it. Come say hello if you've seen this review and I happen to be worki g when you come in! My name is Alyssa & I cant wait to meet yall!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNXJpVTdRRRAB,A Google Maps review about a restaurant.,"Pretty decent little sandwich shop. They have hoagies, cheesesteaks, burgers, wings, and almost any other American type food. Tonight, I saw they had a great deal on Uber Eats offering buy 1 get one 1 free on select items. I decided to try the classic Philly cheesesteak, which also came with their hand cut fries (you also have the option of substituting chicken for steak).

The cheesesteak was about $12.50 each, which I think is an okay price. Portion size is decent too, not too big nor too small. I will say that there was quite a lot of bread in comparison to the meat, cheese, and vegetables. I believe the bun was too thick. The steak itself was pretty flavorful and had a good texture. They use an adequate amount of cheese. Good amount of mushrooms, and each mushroom is quite big, but they do have a slight canned flavor.

The fries were just okay. Quality probably declined due to them being in the car for delivery. Still, they were not bad, and definitely nice to get fries for free. As usual, I would have wanted a bit more salt or pepper, and they were a bit limp.

All in all, not a bad spot for a sandwich, wings, or other classic American fare. The cheesesteak was still enjoyable, just nothing special. I do appreciate the deal they had going on with Uber Eats, though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNnN1a05REAE,A Google Maps review about a restaurant.,"So here's the deal.  The first time I ate at this spot was last month I got the steak hoagie and my bf got the BBQ chicken hoagie.  Both were amazing.  Tonight, we both decided to try the burgers.  I'm only going to give the burgers a 2 out of 5.  The bun was double the size of the burger. The burger was dry, and the bottom of the burger was hard as if it was precooked and sitting. They didn't even ask or include any veggies for the burger.  No lettuce. No tomatoes.  No onions, and I paid 13 bux for this burger. Next, you definitely have to work on a different way of delivering the fries.  They get soggie in plastic containers.  Some places use paper bags.  Just a thought."

It was not too crowded, so we felt ok about her walking and not having to hover over her the entire time (we were always close, but did not have to be attached to her the whole time.) All the enclosures were well kept and pretty. We loved the shade on the front part of the zoo! We will definitely be back many times in the future!

The only thing I wish was better was during the giraffe feeding time, it is very hard to get by that area if you are not taking part."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURROXR6QmZ3EAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,It was a great place very open.   Its one big circle you go around best option is to go left instead of right.

Also another great experience. The staff member there was also very knowledgeable and willing to answer all the questions that you have.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCZzVfQVF3EAE,A Google Maps review about a zoo.,There‚Äôs a park across from here so you park there and walk. Perfect for people with little ones. The woman at the window could of been more friendly! The cost per adult is $9.00 and $7.50 for active military with ID. It‚Äôs a short zoo but very nice. The animals did look sad! My son got to feed the goats. Please fill up the food machine! It takes only quarters. The weather was beautiful! I was hoping we get to feed the giraffes. Overall it‚Äôs about 40-45 mins walk around the zoo.

Their cages were clean and they all seemed happy and well-fed. The whole zoo isn't very big but definitely worth the price. The customer service is what needs a little work. Some of the employees were great and very friendly while others seemed to be bothered by questions. I also didn't like that there was only one very small restroom in the very beginning. But, overall a great ace to visit for a few hours. Also, as everyone has noted the free castle playground in the front is a major plus. The kids loved running around in it after the zoo visit."

Which gave  me a giggle (look at the sign)."

It‚Äôs a nice little zoo but most of the animals were not out. The kids were mostly upset cause they didn‚Äôt get to see the giraffes. Price is reasonable if we would of gotten to see the animals.
