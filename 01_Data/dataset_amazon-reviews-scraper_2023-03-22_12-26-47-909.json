  "reviewDescription": "This was the renewed and not the renewed premium so I figured there may be superficial damage but I did not realize there would be a decent handful of micro scratches directly to the screen. I opened the box and was immediately disappointed. It looked like something I could have bought from a random guy in a mall food court rather than a refurbished phone. The scratches were not huge or deep but where very visible when the light hit them even at an arms length to everyone that looked at it. Requested the return a few minutes after opening the box and shipped it back the very next morning. I did get a quick refund with no real hassle but would have rather had a phone with a decent screen. I then ordered the renewed premium. The last two photos are what I ended up receiving where someone had put on a tape type protector that left a disgusting layer of thick sticky residue completely covering the touch screen. After about a solid two hours of cleaning and I finally had a clean phone but for being renewed premium that’s a bit ridiculous. No scratches obvious on the screen of the second phone and generally happy with the performance but the arrival appearance probably would have made me ship it back again if I was not stubborn to the core. It’s like Amazon wanted me to return both and go to Apple and to buy a brand new phone (which was the next step if I couldn’t get the screen clean on the second one).",

  "reviewDescription": "So for my birthday I was gifted the iPhone 11 which was really nice at first but 3 days in it started to crack. And the longer the day went on the more the cracks started to spread.So had to return that phone which made me very skeptical of getting the iPhone 11 Pro Max instead.I had literally no problems with setting it up or transferring everything, which was such a relief.Have had this phone for a few months and so far no cracks, no scrapes, camera works beautiful, and I can actually hear people when I’m on the phone! The iPhone 11 had TERRIBLE audio and I always had to turn on speaker for calls yet could barely hear.I don’t normally do reviews but this surprised me with how well it’s going. 🙌🏻🥹🥹",

  "reviewDescription": "Update (2/1/23): Ran into some issues, probably things that should be checked upon receipt of a renewed or premium renewed product: 1) battery life [below advertised 80 or 90%], 2) parts replaced, either with genuine or non-genuine Apple parts, 3) overall functionality [defective charging port]. Reducing overall rating to 4-stars.Summary: Upgrading from an iPhone 7 plus, and decided I would go with the 11 Pro Max version. I was on the fence whether the extra money for the premium renewed is worth it, so will be discussing what I considered.Observations: The high level basic differences are: 1) about a $100 difference; 2) three vs. 12 months return period: 3) battery level of 80% vs. 90%. Recommendation: After considering the factors, I decided to look into how much a replacement battery would cost, which is $40 right now. However, starting with the iPhone 8 (i think), Apple started sealing the cases, which requires a heat gun to separate the case because of the extra waterproofing adhesive. To breakdown the addition $100 cost, subtract the $40 battery from that, leaving $60 for an additional 9-months (or $6.67/month) to \"insurance\" to return the phone if issues come up.Carrier Lock: I decided I wanted an unlocked version, and that appears to be another feature that is included with Premium Renewed, with the majority of carrier locked versions being offered as renewed only.Conclusion: For the additional $100, I elected to go with the Renewed Premium. I rate both the Renewed and the Premium Renewed as 5-stars. Which you chose would depend on individual financial and personal factors.Related Products:Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, US Version, 256GB, Midnight - Unlocked (Renewed)4.3 out of 5 stars    12,122 ratings | 1000+ answered questionsPrice: $491.86https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z4681LQ/ Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, 256GB, Midnight Green - Unlocked (Renewed Premium)4.3 out of 5 stars    12,122 ratings | 1000+ answered questionsPrice: $586.00https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BHFGJXF",

Nonetheless, the transferring of data/files was easy, as we took both phones to an AT&T store.  All was done in less than 30 minutes.  The part that took the longest was adding the Apple Watch to the new phone.  The whole process took another 40 minutes.  Overall, the entire experience was very positive.  This is our 3rd phone purchase from the Renewed at Amazon, and have not had a bad experience thus far.",

  "reviewDescription": "Quick Note: The test report screenshot shows three failed items. That's only due to me not having headphones to test at the time as well as the SIM card. I've a screenshot of speed test working on T-Mobile network LTE. So it works fine.Initially I ordered an iPhone 11 Pro Max for my mother, 64GB version. Unfortunately, the ear piece wasn't working and contacted the seller via Amazon message center. I had to send the phone back in order to complete the replacement.They provided the  2-day shipping label (sent out on Saturday, arrived there Monday). They kept in pretty close contact with me and that was good. They shipped Tuesday and received Thursday morning. So there's very little delay in getting the replacement.Diagnostics checked out (see screenshots). The Earpiece tests that failed were due to me not having a headphone to try it on at the time. But I'm assuming it works and will edit if that changes.The condition of the phone is near new! No blemishes on the body and screen looks really clean. There was very minute permanent lines in the screen that looked like smudges, but they with the sceen on, you don't notice it at all. PLUS they gave us a couple acrylic screen protectors, so that was a major plus!The BONUS (at least for me)!It turned out to be a blessing in disguise for me, because they ended up upgrading me to the 256GB model free (initially 64GB model). My mom didn't understand what that meant, and I pretty much explained that she can download apps and take photos to her hearts desire LOL.It's a phone for mom, and she's coming from a Samsung A21 phone that had performance issues and wifi problems. Kept saying there's no internet and reboots in safemode. I wanted simplicity with Face-ID (which also works) that pretty much takes care of itself, and iOS delivers on that.So ya, experienced issues. All devices will have a defect one way or the other (or none). You just need to contact their support and work with them before submitting your review. It annoys me when someone says \"It's defective\" with no resolution comments of what they ended up doing.If I need another replacement phone, I'll definitely do business with them again.",

The only problem I had with that was no live updates on where my package was, it said arriving by 8pm, but got there early at around 2pm. Screen is in great condition, theres a few micro scratches and the top speaker is a little bit dirty but other than that flawless. Camera works great, battery came at 96%, everything so far is working smoothly. No complaints on this end! I will most definitely recommend buying from Amazon Renewed.",

  "reviewDescription": "This gets one star because it is extremely unsanitary to not have thoroughly cleaned and sanitized the phone, especially being that it is necessary Covid precautions. This iPhone looks brand new! Very happy with it, everything is perfect except for the fact that it was not fully cleaned, there is still a lot of dirt in the cracks and crevices, the speakers were still covered in junk and I wish it was cleaned thoroughly! The dirt and grime that was left in the speakers, silent button, camera cracks, only makes me wonder what is under the hood which is extremely concerning and dangerous, being that it is a major health hazard for it to be that way nowadays. It should have been cleaned properly. It is dirty and it still has a lot of junk in the cracks and stuff however I am satisfied with the condition, it is as advertised, great battery capacity, very new! Extremely dirty which is why this is one star, other than that it’s perfect!",

  "reviewDescription": "Amazon you have to do better with verifying and certifying an apple product. You have to be so certain that this product is unlocked because it wasn’t unlocked when I received it and I had took the phone to verify it wasn’t going to be back log with anyone information. Turns out they had some information about who had this phone before I did but it was briefly in someone’s possession for those three days. So I wouldn’t really cold as a renewal product but more like a refurbish product. The iPhone does not come with its Apple box but with an after marketing box with and without the original iPhone wall charger. I decided not to use that wall charger and use my own wall chargers that have been certified by Apple. I don’t think the wall charger that comes with my device or with your device may be certified by Apple.The storage is great to have especially for video creators like myself but the phone does perform very very well and I couldn’t complain too much about my experience dealing with Amazon and buying an Apple product open Amazon. So this should give you some insight on why you should go directly to the Apple store and buy an apple product from the Apple Store. Also you should take it to the Apple Store, to check for warranty optionsUpdate: March 1st 2022I have to make a shocking discovery about this device it turns out they replace the screen in the camera with third-party parts that are not certified by Apple. I took it to Apple to get a diagnostic and turns out the screen wasn’t even an apple screen. The reason why I had very suspicion about the device is how I received it. Also the screen was sometimes black out this is when I became very suspicious while playing a video game on the device. So I continue to ask Apple if they can replace the screen and they told me no. So I took it to a third-party Certified Applerepair shop that fixes iPhones correctly, not only a pay for a new screen but also paid for a new camera that was actually fixed on this device. I pretty much got scammed. I contacted Amazon and spoke to several people about this incident",

I messaged the seller about this and he was fully aware that the items had not been refurbished properly. He was aware of the problem and suggested I “go get it fixed for 50 bucks” … I bought two iPhones from them and it appears that they have the same issue. You can only hear the person on the other line if they are on speaker or if your earphones are connected. I would not recommend them at all. I asked for a partial refund and he said I was “ridiculous” and “nah he won’t do that”… This has been an incredibly inconvenient and awful purchase. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!",

I bought this iPhone and it was the most expensive one out of all the others, because supposedly it was in excellent conditions. Well the phone itself was in great condition. But the audio was horrible, for some reason the audio was messed up and you can barely hear videos or things like that playing. Don’t call something in excellent condition if not everything is in good condition, can’t have a phone for such an amount of money and having horrible problems when it comes to the audio.",

What I received was an iphone with a dead battery, which means that this product was not actually refurbished and a new battery was not put into this phone.

A new battery is always fully charged and holds a charge. This was so dissapointing. I returned this phone to Amazon and will never buy a refurb phone from them again. I spent an extra $100 and purchased one directly from Apple.",
